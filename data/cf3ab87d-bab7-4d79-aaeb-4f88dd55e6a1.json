  "output": "Five common symptoms of diabetes are: \n1. Increased thirst and frequent urination: The increase in thirst is caused by a high level of glucose in the blood. This causes the body to attempt to rid itself of the excess glucose by producing more urine.\n2. Blurred vision: High levels of glucose in the body can be toxic, leading to damage to the lens of the eye, resulting in blurred vision.\n3. Fatigue: High glucose levels can disrupt the body\u2019s ability to convert food into energy, resulting in fatigue.\n4. Slow-healing wounds: Diabetes can cause damage to small blood vessels and nerve fibers, impeding the body\u2019s wound healing ability.\n5. Unintended weight loss: As the body is unable to process glucose without insulin, it may begin to burn fat and muscle for energy, resulting in weight loss.",
