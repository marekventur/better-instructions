  "instruction": "How would you motivate a colleague to meet their deadline?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "I would begin by emphasizing the importance of meeting their deadline, and the positive impact it will have on the team's success. I would also focus on the challenges of meeting the deadline, and encourage them to focus on taking small steps and developing a sense of accomplishment in seeing progress as they move forward. Finally, I would offer to provide any help or resources necessary to ensure success. I would also encourage them to set short-term goals and reward themselves for achieving them. This can help keep them motivated and focused on completing the task.",
