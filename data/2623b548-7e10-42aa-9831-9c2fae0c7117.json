  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a small village where everyone was close friends. They spent their days playing and laughing together, and helping each other out. They were so close that even during difficult times, nothing could break them apart. \n\nOne day, their village was attacked by an evil ogre. Many of the villagers were scared and ran away, but the friends stayed together and protected each other. With a team effort, they were able to defeat the ogre and save the village. \n\nThe people of the village were forever grateful to the friends for standing by them in their darkest hour. The friends were just as grateful for each other, for having such strong bonds of friendship. From that day onward, the villagers relied on each other and celebrated the strength of friendship.",
