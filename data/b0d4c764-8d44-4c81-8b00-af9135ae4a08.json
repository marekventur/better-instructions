  "output": "Friendship is a blessing, more valuable than gold,\nA bond that's built on trust, and makes the heart feel bold.\nA friend will always sleep when you are feeling bad,\nAnd come right along with you when it\u2019s time to be glad.\n\nFriends laugh with each other when the jokes are flowin' free,\nAnd they help learn life lessons together, eternally.\n\nFriendships may be present through hardships and strife,\nAnd make through the good times, the highest of highs.\nDedication between them true is seen and felt,\nMaking sure that their friendship will never ever melt. \n\nEach friendship is unique, with beauty that does grow,\nEach one is special from each other, you know. \nIn friendship, in generous spirit, evergreen,\nA constant reminder of courage and harmony.",
