  "input": "",
  "output": "When I don't understand a concept, I take steps to try to clarify it. I break down the concept into simpler parts, research related topics, and reach out to an expert. I also like to work through examples related to the topic in order to gain a better understanding. If I'm still struggling I'll consult with a teacher or mentor to help me work through the concept. Additionally, I often find it helpful to read through the material again or talk through it with a classmate.",
