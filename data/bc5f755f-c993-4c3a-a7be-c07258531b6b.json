  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a hard fork and a soft fork is the level of disruption that occurs when changes are made to a blockchain. A hard fork requires all nodes on the network to upgrade to the new protocol or software in order for it to be adopted. This can be a major disruption if there is an old version of the protocol still running on the network. A soft fork, on the other hand, is backward compatible and does not require existing nodes to upgrade to the new protocol in order for it to be adopted.  This makes a soft fork less disruptive than a hard fork.",
