  "input": "",
  "output": "A \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d is a mindset developed by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck that emphasizes that qualities such as intelligence and abilities can be developed and improved through effort and perseverance. People who hold this belief tend to be more resilient in the face of challenges and are more likely to see failure as a learning experience, rather than a stamp of permanent inadequacy. This belief is especially important for those in the process of learning, as it provides individuals the motivation to try harder and recover from setbacks that may block their learning trajectories. Not only does it help them succeed in academics, but also gives them a leg up in other areas, such as careers and relationships.",
