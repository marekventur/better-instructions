  "output": "DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the genetic material present in all living creatures. It is composed of two strands which wrap together in a double helix structure, and is made up of four basic components (nucleotides) that repeat in a specific sequence. The DNA sequence is unique for every individual, and it stores the genetic information that dictates the organism's traits. DNA therefore serves as the blueprint that instructs the development, growth and activity of all living things.",
