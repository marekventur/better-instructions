  "input": "",
  "output": "Amazon SageMaker is a cloud-based machine learning platform that allows users to build, train and deploy machine learning models. It automates the model-building process and provides access to managed data processing and model hosting services. TensorFlow is a machine learning library mainly used for deep learning. It can be used to develop complex neural network models, but it requires users to have a deep understanding of its operations and to manually build, train, and deploy models. Amazon SageMaker simplifies the process, whereas TensorFlow provides more flexibility and control.",
