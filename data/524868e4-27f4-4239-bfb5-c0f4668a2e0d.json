  "instruction": "Given a moral dilemma, tell me which is the lesser evil?",
  "input": "You are on an airplane and realize that you are going to crash. You can only save one other person on the plane.",
  "output": "The lesser evil is to save the person who could make the most impact on the world if they were to survive. This could be an infant or a scientist who is researching a life-saving cure, for example. It is better to save someone who can continue to do good in the world, rather than save someone who may not necessarily be able to do as much.",
