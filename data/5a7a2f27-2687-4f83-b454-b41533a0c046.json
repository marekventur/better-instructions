  "input": "",
  "output": "If someone had a bad day, they might choose to take some time out to relax and reset. They might want to disconnect from their work and the pressures of their day-to-day life and take some time to do something they enjoy, like an activity outdoors or curled up with a good book. They might also look for someone to talk to and share their feelings with\u2014a friend, family member, or therapist. Taking a break might also help - whether that involves taking a nap or a distraction like watching a movie or listening to music. Everyone is different and will find different activities that help when they have had a bad day.",
