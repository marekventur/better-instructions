  "input": "",
  "output": "In football/soccer, a penalty kick is awarded when a player commits a foul inside the penalty area, while a free kick is awarded when a player commits a foul outside the penalty area. The penalty kick is taken from the penalty spot, a designated place 12 yards from the goal line, while a free kick can be taken from anywhere between the ball\u2019s position at the time of the foul and the penalty area. The major difference between a penalty and a free kick is that the penalty kick is taken with only the goalkeeper, which increases the chance of scoring, while a free kick also includes the other players of the defending team, which decreases the chance of scoring.",
