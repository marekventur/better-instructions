  "output": "System recovery is the process of restoring a computer system to its original, or near original, state. This typically involves restoring applications, data, settings, and configurations from a backup or previous snapshot. System recovery is typically used in cases where the system has failed due to a hardware or software issue, or when the user wishes to undo recent changes. It is important to regularly back up important data to ensure that it can be recovered in the event of a system failure.",
