  "output": "There he was, standing in the middle of the room, looking out of place and yet so incredibly attractive. His eyes sparkled as he caught sight of her, and she felt as if her heart had been set alight. She wanted to go up to him and tell him how she felt, but was too scared. Instead she remained in the corner, desperately hoping he would somehow noticed her. \n\nHe crossed the room and stopped in front of her. She froze, not knowing what to do or say, but his lips curled up into a smile and he said, \"Hi, I'm Brad\". She told him her name, and as they talked and laughed together, she knew that she was falling in love with a stranger.",
