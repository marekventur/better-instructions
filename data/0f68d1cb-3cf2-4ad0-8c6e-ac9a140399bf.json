  "instruction": "Answer the question - What is the difference between a private key and a public key?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A private key is a piece of data belonging to an individual user or a service, which is used to authenticate and access secure data. It is kept secret and should not be shared with anyone. A public key, on the other hand, is a piece of information that can be shared publicly and that is used to encrypt information sent from one party to another. It does not require a secure location or centralized source of data. It also does not authenticate or grant access to anyone. It can be used to establish trust and ensure the integrity of data sent over the network.",
