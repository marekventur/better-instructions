  "output": "The spaceship had been on a routine mission to explore unknown parts of the galaxy. Suddenly, it was pulled closer and closer towards a nearby asteroid. With the ship's thrusters failing, the crew was helpless as the asteroid swallowed them. As the ship was juddering, the crew realized that they were severely stuck and that their only hope of getting out was to reverse engineer the asteroid and use it to propel themselves into space.",
