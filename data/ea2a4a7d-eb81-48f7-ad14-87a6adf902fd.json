  "input": "",
  "output": "Begin by solving the top layer of the cube, aiming to match the colors of the squares on the top face. After the colors are matched on the top layer, the goal is to solve the middle and bottom layers of the cube by manipulating the cube in the opposite direction of the top layer. Use the specific algorithm to achieve this goal. Then, solve the edges on the middle layer by matching the colors of the two edges with the center square. Lastly, solve the corners on the bottom layer by manipulating the cube to move the pieces to the correct spots. To solve the cube, use the algorithm to rotate the cube in order to match the colors correctly.",
