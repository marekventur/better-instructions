  "input": "",
  "output": "In an autocracy, a single ruler has absolute power and authority over all governmental decisions. This central ruler wields their power through decrees, laws, and edicts to maintain control of the country. Generally, the autocratic ruler is not subject to any type of democratic review or voter approval, nor do they need to consider interests of the public when making decisions. In an autocratic system, government leadership can often remain in power for long periods of time, even for generations.",
