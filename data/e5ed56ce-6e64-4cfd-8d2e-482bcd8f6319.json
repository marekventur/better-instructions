  "input": "",
  "output": "Family life in the 1950s was defined largely by traditional gender roles, with the father being the sole breadwinner and the mother responsible for most of the housework and childcare. Today, family life has become much more egalitarian and couples often share both work and caregiving responsibilities. In the 1950s, nuclear families were the norm and extended families were often geographically separated. In contrast, today extended families often live closer together and there is a greater emphasis on intergenerational support.",
