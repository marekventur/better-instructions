Her contributions to the fields of physics and chemistry include the development of the theory of radioactivity, the discovery of two new elements (radium and polonium), and the ways in which she developed methods for isolating radioactive isotopes. She also helped to develop the systems used in radiological treatment of cancer, and founded the Curie Institutes, which are some of the world's leading medical centers for research into cancer-related diseases.",
