  "input": "Mary had just been hired as a project manager by Aardvark, Inc. But despite the impressive salary, she knew that this job was not going to be easy. She was picked for the job because of her experience in the industry and her references. Mary was up for the challenge and started making plans for the project.",
  "output": "She started plotting out her own strategy for success and dove into the project with both feet. Despite the steep learning curve, Mary worked hard and seemed to be making progress. But when she presented her ideas to her boss, she was met with silence, and the atmosphere in the room grew cold and oppressive. Mary wasn't sure what was going on, and the suspense of waiting to find out kept her on the edge of her seat.",
