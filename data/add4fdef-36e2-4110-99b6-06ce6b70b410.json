  "output": "Three techniques for developing web applications include Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, client-side scripting, and server-side scripting. MVC is a pattern that breaks an application into three distinct parts, namely the model (data structure), view (visual representation), and controller (manages interactions between the model and view). Client-side scripting enables dynamic content to be sent to the browser, while server-side scripting allows the code to be processed on the server-side before it is sent to the browser.",
