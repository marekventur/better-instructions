  "output": "I will design the interior of a high-end restaurant to be sophisticated and inviting. I will use a neutral color palette, like white, beige, and navy blue. For lighting, I will incorporate subtle accent lighting for elegance and warmth. The furniture will include comfortable chairs and upholstered booths. I will incorporate a variety of textures and materials such as wood, leather, and velvet. Finally, modern artwork can be used to enhance the sophisticated atmosphere.",
