  "input": "",
  "output": "The Taj Mahal is renowned for its majestic, awe-inspiring architecture. The iconic building is a harmonious combination of Islamic, Persian, Indian, and Turkish architecture styles that blend together in breathtaking symmetry. The entire structure is encased in white marble, which is ornately decorated with inlaid flowery carvings and detailed frescoes. At the center of the mausoleum stands a towering, four-tiered marble dome that stands 173 feet tall and features geometrically designed perforations at its base. This is surrounded by four minarets that are finely crafted in sandstone and surrounded by four large reflecting pools.",
