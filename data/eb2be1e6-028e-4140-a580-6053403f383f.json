  "instruction": "Develop an algorithm for predicting whether an email is spam or not.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm should first assess the content of the email. It should look for signs of spam like links to suspicious websites, strange characters, subject lines that suggest a scam, and excessive use of punctuation or capitalization. It should also take into account the source of the email, such as an unknown or suspicious email address or domain. Finally, the algorithm should apply statistical analysis to analyse the content and assess the probability of the email being spam.",
