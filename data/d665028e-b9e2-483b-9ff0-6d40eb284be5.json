  "input": "",
  "output": "Vaccines are extremely important in preventing the spread of disease and stopping pandemics. Vaccines contain a weakened or dead version of a virus or bacteria, and when administered they stimulate the body\u2019s immune system to fight off infectious disease by producing antibodies. These antibodies are specific to that virus or bacteria and remain in the body to respond quickly if the person is exposed to the same virus in the future. This enables the body to create immunity to the disease without actually getting sick. Vaccines are highly effective and cost-efficient, and their impact can be seen in the dramatic decrease of dangerous infectious diseases across the world.",
