  "input": "",
  "output": "A convolutional neural network (CNN) can be used in NLP for tasks such as text classification, language modeling, question answering, and sentence similarity. CNNs enable the capture of local, short-term patterns in a text sequence and can help identify meaningful sources of information for language understanding tasks, such as sentence-level sentiment classification and sentence chunking for syntax analysis.",
