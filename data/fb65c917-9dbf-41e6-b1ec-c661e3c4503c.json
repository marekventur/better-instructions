  "input": "",
  "output": "An algorithm for converting text data into numerical data can be created using feature engineering. First, the text data is categorized into a set of distinct values or labels. The labels are then divided into two segments: categorical and numerical. Categorical labels are converted into numerical values using one-hot encoding or frequency encoding. Numerical labels are then normalized using techniques such as min-max normalization or z-score normalization. Finally, numerical values are calculated by combining categorical values, numeric values, and other parameters. This algorithm can then be used to convert text data into numerical data and can be used for machine learning models.",
