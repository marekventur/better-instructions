  "instruction": "Explain the four stages of grief",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The four stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining and acceptance. Denial is the first stage and involves not accepting the reality of the situation. Anger is the second stage and is characterized by feelings of rage and resentment. The third stage is bargaining; in this stage, the individual will attempt to negotiate for a better outcome and look for some sort of control over the situation. Lastly, the fourth and final stage is acceptance; in this stage, the individual understands the loss and can accept their feelings. This does not necessarily mean that the pain subsides, rather that the person can find a way to cope with it.",
