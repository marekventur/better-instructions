  "output": "Physics plays a vital role in the study of astronomy. Its principles and laws are essential in understanding the behavior and evolution of stars, planets, and galaxies. Astronomical phenomena require physical models, such as the laws of motion, to describe the forces acting on them, from gravity and the Doppler effect to the relativistic effects of general relativity. Physics is also used to build sophisticated instruments for observing and recording astronomical phenomena.",
