  "instruction": "Create an algorithm for a self-driving car to follow the road and stop at red lights.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm for a self-driving car to follow the road and stop at red lights should include the following steps: First, the car should detect lane markings and boundaries on the roadway, as well as any traffic lights. Then, the car should determine its current speed and adjust the speed accordingly based on the speed limit or other conditions. Next, the car should process any other road signs that it can see, such as stop signs, yield signs, and road roundabouts. Finally, if the car detects a red light, it should immediately slow down and stop until the light turns green.",
