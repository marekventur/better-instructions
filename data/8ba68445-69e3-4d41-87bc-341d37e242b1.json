  "input": "",
  "output": "Biodiversity is important to ecosystems because it helps to maintain healthy habitats that are capable of supporting a wide variety of species. It also helps to ensure that ecosystems can remain resilient in the face of change, such as climate change, by ensuring that there is enough genetic variety among species to allow them to adapt. Biodiversity is also important for preventing the spread of diseases and providing food, fuel, and materials to people.",
