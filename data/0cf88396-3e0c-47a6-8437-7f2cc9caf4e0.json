  "input": "",
  "output": "In the United States, democracy works through an election process where representatives are chosen by the people. Those representatives are then responsible for making laws and representing the people in government affairs. The President is one example of a representative who is elected by the citizens of the United States. Voting is the main mechanism by which citizens can voice their opinions and have a say in the government. Additionally, civic organizations and protests are means by which citizens can make their voices heard and have an impact on the democratic process.",
