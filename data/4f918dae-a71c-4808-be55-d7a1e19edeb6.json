  "input": "",
  "output": "An advantage of using AI for medical diagnosis is that it can more rapidly and accurately detect and diagnose diseases than traditional diagnostic methods. AI is also capable of incorporating more complex information from multiple sources such as patient histories and medical images to inform a more precise diagnosis. AI models can also become more accurate over time as they \u2018learn\u2019 from data, so the accuracy of diagnoses improves with time.",
