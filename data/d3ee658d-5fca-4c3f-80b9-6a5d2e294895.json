  "output": "A game to improve a child's memory could be a memory match game. To play the game, find several pairs of cards and place them face down on the table. The player then takes turns flipping two cards over. If the player finds a match, they get to keep the pair. If the players do not get a match, they flip the cards back over in the same spot and it is the next player's turn. The player with the most matches at the end is the winner!",
