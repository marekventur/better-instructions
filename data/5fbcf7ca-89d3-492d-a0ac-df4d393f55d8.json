  "instruction": "Explain the downside to the self-checkout system at the supermarket.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The downside to the self-checkout system is that it requires consumers to take more responsibility for their purchases. They must scan the items themselves and enter information such as quantity and type. This can lead to mistakes and slow the checkout process, which causes long lines in the store. Additionally, some self-checkout systems do not accept cash, meaning consumers must use a debit or credit card to purchase items. This can be difficult for people with lower incomes or who do not have access to a bank account.",
