  "output": "I grew up with a deep passion for music, but I never realized it until a defining moment in my teenage years. My parents had taken me to a local symphony when I was twelve and I still remember being struck by the beauty of the music. I was mesmerized by the colors and emotions that the music evoked, and I knew then that I wanted to pursue music. From then on, I started to take music lessons, attend concerts, and purchase records. I slowly began to discover which instruments and styles I enjoyed the most and eventually, my passion evolved into a lifelong love of music.",
