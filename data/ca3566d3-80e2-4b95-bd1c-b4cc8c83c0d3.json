  "input": "",
  "output": "We can create a script that converts text into a musical score by defining a set of rules for mapping text characters to musical notes. We can go through the text characters sequentially and assign a specific musical note to each one. For example, the letter 'a' could be mapped to a note from a major scale, 'b' to a note from a minor scale, and so on. Additionally, we can include options for customizing the musical score, such as tempo, time signature, instrumentation, and key signature.",
