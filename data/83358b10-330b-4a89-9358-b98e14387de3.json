  "instruction": "How is open-ended exploration different from goal-oriented exploration?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Open-ended exploration is about searching for and experimenting with different methods and outcomes until a satisfactory result is achieved. It is a method of exploration that does not require a planned-out path or end goal in mind. Goal-oriented exploration is based on a predetermined objective and is focused on arriving at a specific outcome. It involves researching and analyzing data, developing strategies and plans, and taking concrete steps towards the goal.",
