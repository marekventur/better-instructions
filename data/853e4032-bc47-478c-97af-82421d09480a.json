  "input": "",
  "output": "A market economy is characterised by private ownership and decentralized decision-making, resulting in a range of benefits such as the ability to respond quickly to changes in demand and high levels of efficiency. However, it can also lead to inequality and excess consumption. \n\nIn contrast, a planned economy is characterised by centralised decision-making, government ownership and intervention, which can lead to greater control over the economy and a more equal distribution of resources. However, this system can also lead to bureaucratic inefficiency and sluggish responses to changing circumstances.",
