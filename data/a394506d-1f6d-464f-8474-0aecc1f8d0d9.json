  "instruction": "What is a bond?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A bond is a fixed income investment where you lend a certain amount of money to either a company or a government for a fixed period of time. When the bond expires, the company or government will return your original capital plus interest. Bonds are typically less risky than stocks, and provide investors with a reliable source of income. Depending on the type of bond, the interest payments are typically paid on a regular schedule, such as annually, semi-annually, or quarterly. Most bonds have a fixed maturity date, but there are some bonds (called \u201cperpetual bonds\u201d) which do not expire.",
