  "output": "Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Compared to classical computing, quantum computing relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to store and process data in units of quantum states, instead of bits and bytes. This form of computing can process billions of calculations in parallel, representing a far more efficient form of computing. \n\nA quantum computer consists of quantum bits, also known as qubits. Unlike classical bits, which have a value of either 0 or 1, qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or a superposition of both. This phenomenon allows a quantum computer to perform tasks that are impossible on a classical computer by utilizing principles such as entanglement, which connects qubits together across a quantum network, allowing them to be written and read simultaneously. With this, a quantum computer can solve complex problems that require immense computational power.",
