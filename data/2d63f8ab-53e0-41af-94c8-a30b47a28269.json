  "input": "",
  "output": "C Corporations are a suitable option for entities who want to limit the liability of the owners and would like to raise capital through public debt and/or equity offerings. It is also beneficial for entities that want to enjoy multiple tax benefits and need the flexibility to pass income and losses to shareholders at different times.
