  "output": "The Earth's climate system is made up of five main components: the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and land surface. The atmosphere is composed of mostly nitrogen and oxygen gases and is responsible for transferring energy from the sun to the Earth. The hydrosphere is composed of all the planet's water, including oceans, rivers, lakes, and ground water. The cryosphere is made up of the Earth's frozen water, like ice at the poles, glaciers, and snowpacks. The biosphere is the layer of living organisms and their interaction with the physical environment. Finally, the land surface is composed of plants, soil, and landforms, like deserts and mountain ranges. Together, these components operate together to create the Earth's climate system.",
