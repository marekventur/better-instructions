  "input": "",
  "output": "- Deforestation leads to a decrease in biodiversity, as it destroys the habitats of species that are essential for life on the planet.\n\n- Deforestation causes global warming by releasing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere.\n\n- Deforestation reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in air pollution. It also contributes to desertification as the soil becomes too dry for plants to grow.",
