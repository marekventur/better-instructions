  "input": "",
  "output": "Population density is the number of people living per square kilometer in a given region. It gives an idea of the spatial distribution of people across a particular area. Population growth, on the other hand, is the rate at which people are added to the total population in a given area over time. It measures the increase in the number of people in a population in relation to the amount of time that passed.",
