  "output": "A control variable is a variable that is held constant throughout the experiment. An example of a control variable is the type of container in which the experiment is conducted. \n\nA treatment variable is a variable that is manipulated in order to observe the effect it has on the experiment. An example of a treatment variable is the temperature of the container. \n\nA confounding variable is a variable that could potentially affect the result of the experiment. An example of a confounding variable is the outside temperature, as this could affect the results of the experiment even if the temperature of the container is kept constant.",
