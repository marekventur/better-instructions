  "output": "Rainbows are multi-colored because of the refraction and dispersion of sunlight by raindrops. When the beam of sunlight enters the water droplet, it is bent, or refracted, and then split into its component colors by dispersion. The different wavelengths of light that make up visible light have different refractive indices, which causes them to bend at different angles as they pass through the droplet. Red light has a lower refractive index and is bent at a greater angle than blue light, which has a higher refractive index and is bent at a smaller angle. This separation of light into its component colors is what creates the rainbow.",
