  "output": "The stages of product design include research, ideation/exploration, concept development, design iteration, prototyping/testing, implementation, and maintenance. Research involves collecting data and ideas to inform the design process. Ideation/exploration involves creating and exploring various design ideas. Concept development involves researching, refining and developing ideas into tangible concepts. Design iteration involves refining the concepts through drawing, designing and prototyping. Prototyping/testing involves creating physical models and testing them for form and function. Implementation involves producing and manufacturing the product. Finally, maintenance involves providing support, updates and changes after the product is released.",
