Hurricanes - Hurricanes are powerful storms that often form over warm ocean waters in the summer and early fall.\n3. Tornados - Tornadoes form when cold, dry air and warm, humid air interact with each other to form thunderstorms.\n4. Earthquakes - Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy from the Earth\u2019s crust, most often from shifting of tectonic plates. \n5. Wildfires - Wildfires are often caused by human activities such as arson, but can also be caused by natural causes such as lightning strikes.",
