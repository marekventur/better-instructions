  "input": "",
  "output": "Limited liability is a legal concept which states that shareholders of a business are responsible for its debts only up to the value of the investment they made. That is, if the company fails or is unable to pay its debts, shareholders cannot be held liable for more than the value of their shares. Limited liability protects the shareholders from claims from creditors, making investing in businesses less risky.",
