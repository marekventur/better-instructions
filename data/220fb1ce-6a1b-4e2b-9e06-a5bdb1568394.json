  "instruction": "Summarize a passage about the fundamental principles of modern physics.",
  "input": "Modern physics is based on four fundamental principles. The first is the principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics do not depend on the position or motion of the observer. The second is the quantum mechanical principle, which states that energy and matter can only exist in discrete packets. The third is the principle of conservation of energy and momentum, which states that energy and/or momentum can neither be created nor destroyed. The fourth is the principle of causality, which states that all actions have consequences and that the future is determined by the past.",
  "output": "Modern physics principles rely on four core concepts: the principle of relativity, the quantum mechanical principle, the conservation of energy and momentum, and the principle of causality. The principle of relativity states that physical laws are independent of the observer's position or momentum. Quantum mechanical principle states that energy and matter come in discrete packets. It also states that energy and momentum are conserved, meaning that they can neither be created nor destroyed. Finally, the principle of causality states that events in the future are determined by the past.",
