  "output": "The world is ever so slowly,\nFilled with strife and discord all day.\nWe see war and violence grown,\nThoughts of peace seem so far away.\n\nBut let us not lose hope in this,\nResolve to make a better way.\nLet's start by taking a stand,\nAnd seeing this through to the day.\n\nLet's bridge our differences from here,\nIn efforts so we can unite.\nLet's mold our every relations,\nSeek forgiveness and end the fight.\n\nIn truth and hope shall we stay,\nBuilding peace for us all.\nLet us all make sure this day,\nNot just by us but through us all.",
