  "input": "",
  "output": "The American Revolutionary War (1775-1783) was caused by the political tension between Britain and its American colonies. Britain sought to gain greater control over the colonies, imposing taxes without colonial representation in parliament, while the colonies declared their right to self-governance. This tension ultimately resulted in the Revolutionary War, which ended with the colonies declaring independence and forming the United States of America.",
