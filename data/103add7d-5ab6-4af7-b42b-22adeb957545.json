  "output": "A typical day in summer is filled with the warm rays of the sun, the sound of chirping birds, and the scent of freshly cut grass. In the morning, a breakfast of freshly brewed coffee and a cool breeze on the patio is the perfect way to start the day. The afternoon is filled with activities like swimming at the beach or biking along a nature trail. After the sun sets, a cozy campfire can be enjoyed with friends and family. A refreshing summer day ends with a peaceful night of s'mores and star-gazing.",
