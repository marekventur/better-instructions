  "instruction": "Create a lesson plan for a high school science class about plants.",
  "input": "Lesson plan for a high school Biology class",
  "output": "Objective: Students will gain an understanding of how plants survive by exploring their external and internal structures.\n\nMaterials:\n- Diagrams of plant structures\n- Lab equipment (e.g. magnifying glasses and microscopes)\n- Books, papers, articles\n\nActivities:\n1. Students will examine the external features of plants, focusing on the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits.\n2. Students will discuss the adaptive functions of each external part.\n3. Students will discuss the ways in which plant cells and tissues help plants survive.\n4. Students will use microscopes to observe plant cells up close.\n5. Students will research and discuss the ways in which plants are adapted to various environments.\n6. Students will discuss the importance of plants in the environment and in human life.\n\nAssessment:\nAt the end of the lesson, students will create a poster that illustrates the importance of plants and how they are adapted to survive.",
