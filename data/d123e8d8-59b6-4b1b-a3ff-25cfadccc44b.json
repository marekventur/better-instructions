  "output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the study of computer systems that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, voice recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. AI encompasses a range of capabilities, including learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. It is closely related to computer science, but not the same. AI has demonstrated problem-solving abilities in a range of disciplines such as medical diagnosis, financial trading, robot control, and law. AI is also a popular focus of research in academic and industrial settings.",
