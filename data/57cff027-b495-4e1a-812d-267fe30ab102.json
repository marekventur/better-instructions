  "instruction": "Describe how a computer interprets an assembly language program.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A computer interprets an assembly language program by converting the assembly language instructions into machine code, which the computer is able to understand and execute directly. This process is known as assembly. Assembly language programs are much simpler to read than machine code, and allow programmers to write more complex code with fewer instructions. Additionally, the exact translation of an assembly language program into machine code is specific to the computer architecture being used.",
