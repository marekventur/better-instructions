  "input": "",
  "output": "The transition from feudalism to industrialism in Europe saw a shift from land-based agrarian economies to ones based on technological advances in manufacturing and the development of large-scale industry. This transition led to an increase in population growth, urbanization and the emergence of an industrial working class. It also led to changes in property rights, social relationships and methods of taxation. Furthermore, the agricultural revolution changed the traditional power structure, leading to the rise of the merchant class while simultaneously weakening the nobility.",
