  "input": "Which type of camera is the best for taking pictures of wildlife in its natural habitat?",
  "output": "The best cameras for taking pictures of wildlife in their natural habitat are DSLRs, bridge cameras, and mirrorless cameras. DSLRs provide excellent image quality and professional-level features like interchangeable lenses and manual settings. Bridge cameras offer an impressive level of zoom and good image quality, making them a great choice for getting close up shots. Mirrorless cameras are very lightweight and compact, making them ideal for travelling and getting good shots in difficult environments.",
