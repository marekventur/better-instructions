  "output": "The risks associated with artificial intelligence include the potential for bias in decision making, the potential for data misuse or privacy breaches, the need for extensive security protocols, and the possibility of algorithmic errors or \u201cblack-box\u201d decision making processes that are difficult to explain or understand. Additionally, AI systems rely on a large quantity of data to function, and inadequate data sets can have a significant negative impact on the accuracy and reliability of AI-powered results.",
