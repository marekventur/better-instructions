  "output": "The current economic climate in the US can be likened to a roller coaster. There have been some high peaks and some deep troughs, with the occasional twist and turn thrown in to keep the ride interesting. At the moment, it appears that the US economy is in an upward trend, although there is no telling when it will reach its next peak or when the next dip is going to arrive. So, strap yourselves in and enjoy the ride!",
