  "output": "The UK economy will face various challenges as a result of Brexit. The UK will lose out on the benefits of being part of the European Union's single market, including the free movement of goods, services, capital and labour. Trade flows could be disrupted due to new tariffs and regulations, leading to a decline in investment, employment and overall economic activity. UK businesses may incur additional costs due to associated administrative and logistical burdens. Additionally, there is a risk of the UK being excluded from certain EU-wide financial regulatory frameworks.",
