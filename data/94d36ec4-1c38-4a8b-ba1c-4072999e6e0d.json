  "output": "The sun slips away, setting the sky ablaze \nThe colors ignite, leaving behind a blaze \nGlorious reds, violets and oranges paint the sky \nA final dance of light that makes me sigh \nThe waning light gives a deep calm and peace \nThe setting sun brings a somber release \nThe bright colors turn to a deepening blue \nThe world around me fades and a hush ensues \nThe orange sphere sinking with a final farewell \nPeace and beauty, a sunset casts its spell.",
