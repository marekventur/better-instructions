  "output": "I am alone in the night,\nThe silence a heavy burden to bear.\nThe stars so bright,\nBut none to share.\n\nThe memories still linger,\nOf those who've gone away.\nThe heart feels a certain sting,\nTo face the darkness of the day.\n\nBut in the silence there's something sweet,\nAn opportunity to reconnect with me.\nIt's in this moment I find my peace,\nWhere I find strength and see what must be.\n\nI may not have others by my side,\nBut I will never be left wanting.\nFor being alone is a beautiful thing,\nAnd precious moments that life is granting.\n\nSo embrace the loneliness,\nAllow it to be your guide.\nAnd slowly you will find solace,\nIn the depths that it can provide.",
