  "input": "",
  "output": "The quantum entanglement theory has implications for quantum computing, cryptography, teleportation, and quantum networks. According to the theory, two particles can be connected even if they are separated by vast distances and interact in unpredictable ways. This can potentially be used to create quantum computers that are billions of times faster than traditional computers, allowing them to solve problems that are intractable on classical computers. It can also be used to create unbreakable quantum encryption and secure quantum networks, as well as enable teleportation of information and particles.",
