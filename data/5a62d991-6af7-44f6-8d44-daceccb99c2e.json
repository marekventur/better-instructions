  "input": "",
  "output": "The economic effects of Brexit have been far-reaching. The resulting uncertainty has caused economic output and investment to decline, leading to job losses in the UK and throughout Europe. The pound has also weakened in response, increasing inflationary pressures on businesses and households. Trade has also been affected, with the UK losing preferential access to the Single Market of the European Union and having to face the additional administrative and financial costs of operating in a more regulated environment. In addition, the UK's budget deficit and public debt have grown, as the government spends more and collects less in tax revenue.",
