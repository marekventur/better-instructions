  "output": "A computer programmer is an important part of the programming industry, providing the knowledge and skill necessary to build and enhance software applications, systems and websites. Computer programmers are responsible for writing, testing and modifying code according to industry standards, in order to make an application or system run as desired. They use programming languages such as Ruby, Python and Java to write the code, and they possess a broad understanding of the software development process, including design, software testing, debugging, and computer networks. Computer programmers also need to be able to collaborate and communicate effectively with their colleagues in order to ensure that the application they are working on meets their team's standards.\n\nComputer programmers need to be highly organized, creative problem solvers. They must be adept at both core programming techniques and software development. Problem-solving skills are particularly important when making sure that code is optimized, in line with the specifications of the application, free from programming errors, and secure.\n\nIn order to stay up-to-date with best practices and emerging technologies, computer programmers must be willing to engage in continuing education, such as attending conferences and seminars, or taking online courses. They continuously strive to make their code the most efficient it can be, and need to be able to think outside the box in order to come up with innovative solutions.",
