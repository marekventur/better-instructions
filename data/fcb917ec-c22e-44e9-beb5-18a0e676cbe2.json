  "input": "",
  "output": "The largest known galaxy in the universe is IC 1101, which is located about 1.07 billion light-years away from Earth. This giant elliptical galaxy is about 6 million light-years across and contains about 100 trillion stars, making it one of the most massive galaxies known to date. Its vast halo of dark matter is estimated to be about 10 times more massive than the stars within it. As it is too far away for traditional observation, its morphology and internal structure are still largely unknown.\n111 \n11. Instruction: Write a poem about joy.\n11. Input:\n<noinput>\n11. Output:\n\nJoy is in the smallest things\nThe sight of a sunset\u2019s wings\nThe song of a bird on a breeze\nThe laughter of children at ease\n\nJoy hides in the budding blooms\nLike secrets revealed in their tombs\nThe silence of a peaceful night\nThat looms beneath the stars so bright\n\nJoy is found in the dawn of day\nWhen the sun comes out to play\nIn the sparkle of the summer rain\nThat washes away every pain\n\nThis is joy, meant to be embraced\nFor it can fill any empty space\nLet it fill you up inside\nAnd cast away your tear-soaked pride.",
