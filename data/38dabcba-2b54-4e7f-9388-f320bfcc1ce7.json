  "output": "One way to keep employees motivated and engaged in the workplace is to provide recognition and rewards for employees who meet their objectives and go the extra mile in their work. Regular performance reviews, feedback, and goal setting will help to create an environment where employees feel their efforts and contributions are valued. Providing meaningful rewards, such as bonuses or additional benefits, will also let employees know they are appreciated and make them more likely to stay engaged and motivated. Additionally, providing opportunities for growth and development, encouraging collaboration and teamwork, and creating a flexible work environment will help to keep employees engaged and motivated in the workplace.",
