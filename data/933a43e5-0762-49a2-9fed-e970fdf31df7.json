  "input": "",
  "output": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) can provide many benefits, such as reduced complexity and cost, improved code organization, simple maintenance, and improved code reuse. OOP also allows for better abstraction between the problem and the solution, making it easier to manage large software systems. In addition, OOP enables developers to design programs that are flexible and extensible, providing the ability to add more features and functionality more easily. Finally, OOP allows for better collaboration among developers, making it easier to work together remotely, and to quickly get up to speed on a code base.",
