  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sophia who lived on the edge of a great forest. One day, she ventured deep into the trees on a mission to explore the unknown, but after hours of wandering, she became lost in the darkness of the forest. Suddenly, she realized that she had accidentally gone too far from her home. She panicked and started crying when, suddenly, a bright light shined in the darkness. Sophia followed the light and it led her to a small cottage in a clearing. Inside she found an old woman who kindly offered her a warm meal and a cozy bed for the night. Sophia thanked the woman for being so kind, and soon after she was able to find her way home.",
