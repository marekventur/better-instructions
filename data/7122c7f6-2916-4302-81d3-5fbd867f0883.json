  "input": "",
  "output": "Photosynthesis is a process in plants whereby sunlight is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules and is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The oxygen is then released into the atmosphere while the glucose is used as a source of energy for the plant.",
