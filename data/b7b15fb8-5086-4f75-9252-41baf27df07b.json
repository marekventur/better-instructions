  "input": "",
  "output": "The black mamba snake is one of the world's most venomous snakes, with a reputation for being particularly aggressive. This species is characterized by its long and slender body which can reach up to 14.5 feet in length, its black-colored scales, and its wide, triangular-shaped head. Its mouth is lined with a distinctive white and yellow coloration which is used to ward off predators and deter attackers. Its bite delivers a powerful neurotoxin which can cause paralysis, respiratory failure, and death if left untreated. Despite its reputation, the black mamba is actually shy and reclusive, and will typically flee if disturbed.",
