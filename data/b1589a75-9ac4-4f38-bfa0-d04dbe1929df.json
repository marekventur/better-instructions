  "instruction": "How would you design an algorithm for summarizing text?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm would first parse the text and identify passages and phrases that are important. These important parts could then be used to establish a summary of the text in a concise manner. To determine the important parts of the text, it could use features such as keyword frequency, sentence length, sentence structure, and context clues. After these important parts have been identified, the algorithm could then be used to generate an output summarization. The summarization should be able to condense the key points of the text while preserving its structure and meaning.",
