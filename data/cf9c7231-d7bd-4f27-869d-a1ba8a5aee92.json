  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Alliteration: Alliteration is a literary technique in which the same letter or sound is repeated multiple times in a phrase or sentence. It is used to draw attention to words and to create a pattern of sound for the reader. \n\n2. Metaphor: A metaphor is a figure of speech in which a comparison is made between two unlike things or ideas in order to create a vivid picture description. It is used to express complex ideas in a simpler way that is easier to understand. \n\n3. Personification: Personification is a figure of speech in which inanimate or non-human objects, forces, or ideas are given human qualities. This can be used to bring qualities to life that would not naturally exist and to make dull topics more interesting.",
