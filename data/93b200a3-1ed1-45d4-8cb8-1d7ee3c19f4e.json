  "instruction": "Explain what a logical syllogism is.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A logical syllogism is a three-part argument used in logic to arrive at a conclusion. It consists of two premises and one conclusion. The first premise states a universal truth, the second premise narrows that truth and the conclusion is derived from combining the two premises. For example, the syllogism \u201call humans are mortal, Socrates is a human, therefore Socrates is mortal\u201d relies on the universal truth that \u201call humans are mortal\u201d, and provides proof by showing that Socrates is a human. Therefore, the conclusion that Socrates is mortal follows logically.",
