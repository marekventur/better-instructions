  "instruction": "Compare the themes of freedom in \"The New Colossus\" and \"Sonnet 19\".",
  "input": "\"The New Colossus\" by Emma Lazarus and \"Sonnet 19\" by William Shakespeare",
  "output": "Both \"The New Colossus\" by Emma Lazarus and \"Sonnet 19\" by William Shakespeare present the theme of freedom in their respective works. Lazarus' poem speaks of the hope and promise of freedoms that immigrants will find while coming to America, while Shakespeare's sonnet focuses on the freedom that can be found in self-expression and the appreciation of nature. Both works emphasize the importance of freedom, but do so from different perspectives. While Lazarus speaks of liberation from tyranny and the promise of a better new life, Shakespeare looks inward and finds liberty in the simple pleasure of expression. Both poems are ultimately a celebration of the power of freedom and the joy it brings.",
