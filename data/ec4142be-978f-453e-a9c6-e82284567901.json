  "output": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the ability of systems to use data and patterns to improve their performance. It involves using algorithms to analyze data and then using the insights gained to build predictive models that enable the system to learn how to make decisions or predictions. It can be thought of as a form of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn how to increase their accuracy in solving problems without being explicitly programmed.",
