  "input": "",
  "output": "Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung are two of the most influential psychoanalytic theorists. Freud believed that the unconscious mind is the driving force behind human behavior and that unconscious processes such as repression and regression can be labeled as \u201cdefense mechanisms\u201d. Jung, on the other hand, focused on concepts of the collective unconscious and symbolism while emphasizing the importance of the individual being in sync with his or her environment, striving for self-actualization. Both theories contribute valuable insights into human behavior and mental processes.",
