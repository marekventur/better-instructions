  "instruction": "Create an entity recognition system for a given dataset.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A suitable approach for entity recognition is to use a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system. This would involve using techniques such as feature engineering, part-of-speech tagging, rule-based matching and supervised machine learning algorithms to identify different entities present in the data. The identified entities could then be categorized into pre-defined entity classes such as Location, Person, Organization, Date, Time, Number and Monetary value. Once the entities have been identified, they can be further used for higher-level tasks such as semantic parsing or question answering.",
