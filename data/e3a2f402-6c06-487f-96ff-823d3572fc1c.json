  "input": "No input",
  "output": "One way to reduce global warming is by making a concerted effort to switch to clean sources of energy, like solar or wind power. This means installing solar panels or wind turbines instead of relying on fossil fuels. Additionally, making an effort to limit energy consumption, recycling, and increasing green spaces can help reduce global warming.",
