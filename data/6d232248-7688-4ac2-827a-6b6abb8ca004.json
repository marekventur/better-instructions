  "output": "Recently, I encountered a difficult situation that required me to draw on my problem solving skills. I was in charge of a school club event, but just two days before the event, a number of volunteers pulled out due to unforeseen circumstances. With so little time to find replacements and the event quickly approaching, I knew that I had to take action. \n\nSo, I quickly reached out to friends and fellow students, explaining the situation and appealing to their sense of service. Within hours, I had successfully secured a full complement of volunteers and saved the event. In this crisis, my problem solving skills proved invaluable as I was able to remain calm, come up with a plan, and reach out to people to get the help I needed.",
