  "output": "Color plays an important role in design. It is used to create contrast, draw attention, evoke emotions, and to convey meaning. Different combinations of colors can create a sense of harmony, balance, and even excitement. Color can also be used to create a sense of cohesion in a design, harmonizing the different elements of the design. Additionally, color can be used to create visual illusions and to create an illusion of depth and space.",
