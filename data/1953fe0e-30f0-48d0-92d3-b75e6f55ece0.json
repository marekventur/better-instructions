Along the way, he encountered a majestic whale, which was swimming alongside a beautiful, vibrant butterfly. The lemon was in awe of the creature's beauty, and the whale seemed to be following the butterfly in the vast open sea. The lemon kept following the pair until he eventually reached the shore and then happily continued on his journey.",
