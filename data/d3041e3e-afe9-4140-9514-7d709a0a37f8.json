  "input": "",
  "output": "Black coffee has a bitter and slightly acidic taste, as well as a robust aroma. The flavor is often intense and complex, with layers of different notes depending on the coffee's origin. The coffee's acidity comes through as a sharp and tangy taste, and the bitterness is usually mild and smooth. The bitterness gives way to a sweet aftertaste, making black coffee a pleasing drink with a well-rounded flavor.",
