  "input": "",
  "output": "SQL databases are relational databases that use Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation and retrieval. SQL databases are traditionally easier to learn and more powerful, requiring more complex query syntax to access data from multiple tables. NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that can be either document-oriented, using more complex data structures such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or graph databases, or key-value stores, which can store data in any data structure. NoSQL databases tend to be more flexible and easier to work with in terms of data structures and are better suited for large-scale applications and distributed systems.",
