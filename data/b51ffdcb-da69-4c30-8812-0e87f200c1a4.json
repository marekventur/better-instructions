  "output": "A rainforest is an ecosystem that is composed of dense vegetation and a variety of plant and animal species that are adapted to the environment. Rainforests are characterized by hot and humid climates and receive a lot of rain - usually more than 1000mm per year. These forests are often home to some of the most diverse life forms on Earth, with millions of different species of trees, plants, fungi, insects, birds, mammals, and other animals living in symbiosis with each other.",
