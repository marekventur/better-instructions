  "input": "",
  "output": "The trees sway in the gentle breeze,\nLike waves of emotion seeming to freeze.\nThe sun shines through the clouds so grey,\nUplifting in sad ways like a new day.\n\nThe water rush of a surging tide,\nMuch like a passionate feeling inside.\nThe stars floating in the night sky,\nRemind us of a time gone by.\n\nThe clouds rolling over mountains so high,\nRising and falling just like a sigh.\nThe wind blowing through the trees and grass,\nLike an aching sadness as we look to the past.\n\nNature has its own way of conveying emotion,\nA thought that we often need to ponder on.\nIt is a thing for us to remember,\nFor its beauty is a sight to savor.",
