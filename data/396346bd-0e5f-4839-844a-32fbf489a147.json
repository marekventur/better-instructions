  "input": "John had just finished his last exam and was walking out of the college campus, happily looking forward to the summer break.",
  "output": "John had spent the morning packing up his stuff and saying goodbye to his friends. He was looking forward to his summer holiday, but he was anxious about his future. He had dreams of travelling and exploring the world, but he was worried that he wouldn't have the funds to do so.\n\nJohn began to walk home, taking in the sights and sounds he had grown so accustomed to at his university. As he walked, he noticed a small music shop tucked away in a corner. He had walked past it dozens of times before, but this time something drew him in.\n\nInside, the shop was mostly empty, except for a young woman playing a guitar and singing a song he had never heard before. He watched and listened, almost mesmerized by her performance. When she finished, she thanked him for listening, and asked if he wanted to have a beer with her.\n\nAlthough a bit surprised, John took her up on the offer, and the two went to a nearby pub. Over the next few weeks, the two discovered a shared passion for music, exhilarating adventures, and a deep desire to explore whatever the future had in store for them. John decided to use his summer break to pursue those dreams together.",
