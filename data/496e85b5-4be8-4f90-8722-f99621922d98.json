  "input": "",
  "output": "Nuclear energy is produced by fission, in which atoms are split inside a nuclear reactor. This releases energy, which is used to generate heat. The heat is then used to produce steam, which is used to drive turbines and generate electricity. Uranium is the most common nuclear fuel used to produce nuclear power. Other nuclear fuels include plutonium, thorium, and fusion fuels. These fuels are used in a nuclear reactor in order to produce energy.",
