  "output": "An example of collective action is a group of people coming together to work towards a common goal. A good example of this would be a citizens\u2019 campaign that rallies people around a political cause, such as a petition to end the use of a certain type of pollutant. Collective action can also take the form of protests and strikes, such as protests to increase the minimum wage or strikes to ensure better working conditions.",
