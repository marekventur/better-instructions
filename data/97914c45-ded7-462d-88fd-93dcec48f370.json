  "output": "The five main punctuation marks are the period (.), the comma (,), the semicolon (;), the colon (:), and the apostrophe (\u2019). \n\nThe period is used to denote the end of a sentence. \n\nThe comma is used to separate parts of a sentence, or to denote a pause.\n\nThe semicolon is used to separate two main clauses in a sentence, or to join two closely related sentences. \n\nThe colon is used to introduce a list, a quotation, or an explanation of a preceding idea. \n\nThe apostrophe is used to denote possession, to indicate missing letters, or to form a contraction.",
