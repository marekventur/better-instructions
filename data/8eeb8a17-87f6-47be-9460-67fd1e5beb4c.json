  "input": "",
  "output": "The main advantages of home ownership are that you build equity over time, you can customize your living space, and you have more stability. On the downside, you may have to deal with maintenance, upkeep, and any repairs that need to be done. \nRenting has the advantage of not having to worry about maintenance and repairs, but it can be less stable and may provide fewer customization opportunities. Additionally, while you pay rent each month, that money is not building any equity.",
