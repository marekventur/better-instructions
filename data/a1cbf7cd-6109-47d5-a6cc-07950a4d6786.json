  "input": "",
  "output": "Light travels faster than sound because it is an electromagnetic wave which can travel through a vacuum at its speed of 186,000 miles per second. Sound is a pressure wave which requires a material medium (air, water, etc.) to travel through and is much slower, at approximately 767 mph in dry air.",
