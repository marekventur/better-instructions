  "instruction": "Why is the boiling point of water higher at higher altitudes?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The boiling point of water is higher at higher altitudes because the atmospheric pressure is lower. Therefore, it takes less energy to evaporate water molecules at a given temperature, resulting in a higher boiling point.",
