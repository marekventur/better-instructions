  "output": "One of the biggest trends in Machine Learning at the moment is the use of transfer learning and pre-trained models. Transfer learning is a technique in which a model is trained on a dataset and then used to create an entirely different model, allowing new models to learn from what was learned previously, saving time, costs and resources. Pre-trained models are models that are already trained for a certain task, such as language translation and natural language processing, and are then adapted for use in other tasks such as image classification, object detection, and text summarization.",
