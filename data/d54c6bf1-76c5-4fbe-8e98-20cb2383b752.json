  "output": "Urban agriculture in the United States faces a range of challenges. These challenges include physical barriers such as land scarcity and limited soil quality. Other obstacles include urban policies that often restrict the amount of land that can be used for urban agriculture and the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Additionally, urban farmers often lack access to resources such as technical assistance, capital and adequate markets. Urban agriculture also faces issues concerning public perception and the need for strong networks and partnerships in order to be successful. However, many communities are finding innovative ways to overcome these challenges and reap the various benefits of utilizing urban spaces to grow food.",
