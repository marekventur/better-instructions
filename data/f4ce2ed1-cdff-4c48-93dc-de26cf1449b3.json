  "input": "",
  "output": "Three effects of deforestation include loss of habitat for wildlife, disruption of water cycles and climate change. Deforestation leads to a loss of habitats for animals, making it more difficult for them to find food and shelter. Deforestation also disrupts the natural water cycle by preventing absorption of water by trees, leading to drier soils, floods, mudslides, and droughts. Finally, deforestation contributes to climate change due to the release of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas.",
