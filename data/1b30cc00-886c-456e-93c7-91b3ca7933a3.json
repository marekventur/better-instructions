  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved going to the library. She would often spend her summer days buried in books on the beach, just out of reach of the waves. One day, while the girl was reading a book, the tide unexpectedly rose and suddenly she was surrounded by water. When she looked up, she was in the middle of a beautiful sand castle! With a start, she realized her book hadn\u2019t been ruined - it had actually been hidden in the castle! Glancing around, she realized the sand castle had been built from the pages of her own books! Realizing her present was also her own past, the girl smiled and returned to her reading.",
