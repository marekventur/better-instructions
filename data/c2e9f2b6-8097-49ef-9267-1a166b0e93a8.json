  "output": "LED lighting offers two major benefits: \n\n1. Energy efficiency: LED bulbs use up to 90% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs, resulting in reduced energy costs.\n\n2. Long life: LED bulbs have a much longer lifespan than traditional bulbs, typically lasting up to 50,000 hours or more. This means that fewer bulbs need to be replaced over time, saving time and money.",
