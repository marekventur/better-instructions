  "input": "",
  "output": "The equation for calculating mass is Mass = density x volume. Mass is the measure of an object's inertia and is determined by multiplying its density with its volume. Density is the mass per unit of volume and is usually expressed in terms of kilograms per cubic meter. Volume is the three-dimensional space occupied by an object and is usually expressed in terms of cubic meters.",
