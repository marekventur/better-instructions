  "input": "",
  "output": "Neural network training is a process which involves using an algorithm to iteratively and incrementally modify the weights of the connections between neurons in the network. This is done in order to reduce the error between the model\u2019s predictions and the desired output. The algorithm adjusts the weights of the connections based on how the network performed on a particular data set, and the error is measured based on a loss function. The process of modifying the weights is repeated until the model achieves the desired accuracy.",
