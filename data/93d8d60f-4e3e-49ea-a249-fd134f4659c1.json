  "input": "<No input>",
  "output": "People are driven to hoard money for a variety of reasons. Some hoard money as a means to exert control over their lives. It allows them to feel safe and secure in uncertain times. Others may do so to gain a sense of power, as an expression of success, or out of fear of running out of money. Additionally, hoarding is sometimes a way to deal with the guilt and shame of having excess wealth that cannot be shared or given away.",
