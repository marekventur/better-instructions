  "instruction": "Describe the impact of ocean acidification on coral reefs.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Ocean acidification is a major threat to the health of coral reefs, as it decreases the concentrations of calcium carbonate minerals in the ocean, which are essential to coral reef growth and health. Due to this decrease, coral reefs are unable to absorb the calcium and other essential minerals they need to survive, leading to a decrease in coral growth, bleaching, and eventual death. Additionally, ocean acidification can detrimentally affect the species that rely on coral reefs, such as fish, turtles, and other marine life.",
