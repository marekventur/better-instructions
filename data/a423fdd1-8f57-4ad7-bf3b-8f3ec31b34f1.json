  "output": "A wiki is an online platform that allows users to view, add, and modify content on a single page or multiple pages. It is a collaborative tool, meaning different people can contribute, update, and edit the content, allowing a large and diverse group of people to share knowledge. Wikis are often used in educational settings to help research and summarize information and can also be used for business purposes. Wikis are especially useful for groups of people who are working together on a project, as many people can easily access and update the content from remote locations.",
