  "input": "",
  "output": "A possible solution to reducing global poverty is to invest in the education of people living in disadvantaged areas, and provide job training and other resources that can help create economic growth. Additionally, providing access to basic needs such as food, water, and healthcare can counteract many of the effects of poverty. Governments and other organizations could also support businesses and industry in poverty-stricken regions, which could create new job opportunities for those living there.",
