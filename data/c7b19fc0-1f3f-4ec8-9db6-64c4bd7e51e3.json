  "output": "In the streets of the city, the air is so thick\nThe hustle and bustle of life, no time to sit\nThe crowds and the noise, a 24/7 beat\nSometimes we forget what a walk in nature can bring\n\nAdrift in a sea of concrete, a view of a skyline so grand\nThe shops and the restaurants, the parks and the sand\nWe work hard and play hard, our dreams to fulfill\nThe urban lifestyle, with its highs and its lows, our stories to tell",
