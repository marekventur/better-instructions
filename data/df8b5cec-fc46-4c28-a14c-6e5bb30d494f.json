  "input": "",
  "output": "The two major branches of Christianity, Catholicism and Protestantism, differ in beliefs on many important topics. Catholics recognize the Pope as the highest authority in the Church, while Protestantism is divided into a wide range of denominations which recognizes other forms of authority such as the bible or church councils. Catholics recognize seven sacraments while Protestants only recognize two, baptism and communion. Catholics also believe in transubstantiation, the belief that bread and wine become the literal body and blood of Jesus Christ during the sacrament of communion.",
