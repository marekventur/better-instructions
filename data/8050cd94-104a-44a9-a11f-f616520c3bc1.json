  "output": "Friends bring laughter and help heal the heart,\nBrightening our days with a brand new start.\nPouring out love and compassion so strong,\nSharing moments, togetherness grows in song.\nEasier to reach out when things seem so tough,\nKnowing there's someone who understands enough.\nIt's a gift of joy, as friendship finds its way,\nHelping us stay afloat above the fray.",
