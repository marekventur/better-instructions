  "instruction": "Describe the difference between evidence-based policy and convention-based policy.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Evidence-based policy is policy that is formulated and implemented after careful evaluation, testing and validation of relevant scientific evidence. It is guided by research results and empirical data to inform decision-making. In comparison, convention-based policy involves making policy decisions based on commonly accepted solutions or established trends and practices, rather than on information and research results. This means that the policy decisions may not be based on the best available data, and could potentially be outdated or incorrect.",
