  "input": "",
  "output": "The American and Chinese education systems differ in many respects. In the US, education is highly decentralized with each state and local community having its own systems of teacher certification, curriculum and assessment standards. The US education system also has greater emphasis on individual achievement, encouraging children to become independent thinkers, problem solvers and innovators. In contrast, the Chinese education system is highly centralized, with a single national curriculum and a standardized test determining university entrance. Further, the Chinese system emphasizes the collective, with an emphasis on learning by memorizing, rather than independent thinking and problem solving. While both systems produce excellent students, the US education system is more adaptive to individual needs and encourages more critical thinking, while the Chinese system is more focused on the collective and preparing students for standardized tests.",
