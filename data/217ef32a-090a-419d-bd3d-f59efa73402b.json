  "input": "",
  "output": "John Locke's philosophy on human nature is based on the idea that humans are tabula rasa at birth. He argues that humans are merely molded by their environment, rather than coming into the world with pre-determined values or existing knowledge. He states that we build our knowledge and opinions through experience, and our understanding of the world is fluid. He believes that humans are rational and are born with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He sees human nature as something to be protected, which can only be done by having a functioning government that ensures the safety and well-being of its citizens.",
