  "instruction": "Propose a hypothesis to explain this observation.",
  "input": "Recent studies have found that greater outside temperature leads to increased aggression in humans.",
  "output": "The hypothesis is that increased heat leads to higher levels of aggression perhaps due to a decrease in people's ability to self-regulate emotions in warmer environments. Additionally, increased outside temperatures can put people in a more negative emotional state, which can lead to aggression.",
