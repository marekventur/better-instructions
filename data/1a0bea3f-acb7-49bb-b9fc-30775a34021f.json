  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary function of a recurrent neural network (RNN) is to process data with temporal or sequential correlation. This means that an RNN can be used to detect patterns in data that changes over time, such as text, audio, or video. These patterns are captured by the RNN in the form of memory, allowing the network to generate more accuracte predictions for sequential data. RNNs are particularly useful for tasks such as natural language processing, handwriting recognition, and speech recognition.",
