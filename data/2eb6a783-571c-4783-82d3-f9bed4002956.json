  "input": "",
  "output": "Verbal irony is a type of indirect statement in which someone says the opposite of what they mean, often for humorous or rhetorical effect. In verbal irony, the words spoken are clearly not meant to be taken literally and instead express a meaning opposite to that which would normally be conveyed. For example, if someone says \"what a great day\" when it is raining outside, this is an example of verbal irony. Regardless of what is stated, the literal meaning of the words is not in line with the intent of the speaker.",
