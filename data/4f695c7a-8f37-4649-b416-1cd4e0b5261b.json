  "input": "",
  "output": "I would start by acknowledging the customer's frustration and showing empathy. This could be done by using phrases such as \"I understand your frustration,\" or \"I can see why this is an issue for you.\" \n\nI would also reiterate my understanding of the customer's problem and express my desire to help. Examples of this type of language include, \"I want to help you figure this out\" or \u201cLet me see what options we have available to us.\u201d\n\nNext, I would explain the possible solutions that may be available to address the customer's issue. It will be important to explain each option in plain language and in detail, so that the customer can make an informed decision.\n\nI would then take the initiative to offer to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and make sure that the customer has all of the necessary details.\n\nFinally, I would thank the customer for bringing the issue to my attention and reassure the customer that if further assistance is needed, I am more than happy to help.",
