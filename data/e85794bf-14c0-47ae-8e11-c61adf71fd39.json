  "output": "The interior of a spaceship is typically sleek and minimalistic, with bright, clean surfaces and soft glowing lights. There is a variety of control consoles and monitors for monitoring, tracking and controlling a spacecraft. There may also be displays for entertainment and communication purposes. The walls usually have a cushioning material to protect the astronauts from any shocks or vibrations that may occur as the spacecraft moves through space. There may also be storage compartments for storing equipment or provisions for long-term missions.",
