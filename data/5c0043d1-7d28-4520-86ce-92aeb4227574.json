  "input": "",
  "output": "When a cat feels threatened, their eyes will become wide, their pupils will dilate, and their head will lower in defense. The pupils will dilate to a much larger size than normal, allowing them to take in more light so that their vision is sharper when they react to the threat. The cat might also stare fixedly at its threat before deciding whether to flee or fight.",
