  "input": "",
  "output": "The answer to the question \"did the Wright Brothers really invent the first airplane?\" is generally accepted to be yes. The Wright Brothers are credited with inventing and building the first successful powered airplane. On December 17, 1903, they achieved the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight which was accomplished with their Wright Flyer. This accomplishment was made four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and lasted only 12 seconds. Subsequent testing and modifications of the Wright Flyer led to the first public flights in 1904. These flights marked the world's first successful invention and sustained flight of a powered airplane.",
