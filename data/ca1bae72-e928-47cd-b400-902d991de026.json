  "instruction": "Create an algorithm to detect malicious URLs given a data set of URLs.",
  "input": "Data Set of 200 URLs",
  "output": "My algorithm for detecting malicious URLs involves first checking for any URLs that have suspicious characters or strings in them, such as %@&, HTML codes, and IP addresses, which could point to a malicious website. Second, I would use machine learning to identify and isolate any URLs in the data set that have been previously marked as malicious by cybersecurity analysts or malicious URL databases. Third, I would utilize natural language processing to detect any URLs with questionable grammar and spelling, which could indicate a spoof website. Lastly, I would use a web crawler to analyze each URL in the content, links, and other resources of the website to identify any suspicious activity or content.",
