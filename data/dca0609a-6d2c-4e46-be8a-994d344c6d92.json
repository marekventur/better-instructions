  "output": "I love you more than the stars in the night sky, \nMore than a thousand words could ever describe, \nYet I express it not with a kiss or a sigh, \nBut with a gentle smile and a soft goodbye.\n\nI love you more than the sea ever could know, \nMore than mountains can measure or days can count, \nDescribing my feelings, I can never quite show,\nBut in the smallest gestures or moments, I speak without a sound.\n\nI love you more than I have ever loved before, \nMore than a million secrets I haven't told, \nThough I make no promises no matter what I swore,\nMy love refuses to take any more boundaries or fold.\n\nSo here, I declare, with love so untold, \nThat I am forever in your heart, never to grow old.",
