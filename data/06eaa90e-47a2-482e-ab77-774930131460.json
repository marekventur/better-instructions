  "output": "Global warming is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. It is caused by the excess release of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which trap heat, leading to an overall rise in global temperatures. The resulting consequences are immense and far-reaching, from Arctic ice melting to rising sea levels to increasingly frequent and violent storms. To limit the effects of climate change and global warming, it's important to reduce our collective carbon footprints by making sustainable lifestyle changes, such as limiting energy usage, driving less, and eating more plant-based foods.",
