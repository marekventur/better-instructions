  "input": "The life and times of the town's sole librarian, Mr. Evans.",
  "output": "Mr. Evans is the town's librarian, the keeper of knowledge and stories. He has a fondness for both his job and the town he lives and works in. He is generally quiet and keeps to himself, but has a dry wit that often enlivens conversations. From his time as librarian, he has accumulated stories of the town's past, and is eager to share them with anyone who will listen.\n\nThe structure of the story should focus on Mr. Evans and his relationship with the town, using his stories of the town as a way of connecting with the other characters. Focus on his interaction with other characters, and how both his often-overlooked selflessness and his remarkable intelligence help the town. The story should have moments of both levity and sadness, as showing how both of those emotions play a part in Mr. Evans\u2019 life. Ultimately, the story should be an exploration of the importance of Mister Evans to the town, and how his legacy and the legacy of the town are one in the same.",
