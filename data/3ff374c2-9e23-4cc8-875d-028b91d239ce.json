  "instruction": "Briefly explain the role of the states in the US Constitution.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The US Constitution divides the power of the federal government between the states and the federal government. States are given the power to handle matters that are considered \u201cinternally\u201d related to the state, while the federal government handles matters considered \u201cexternally\u201d related or that affect the country as a whole. This means that the federal government has control over issues such as foreign policy and currency, while the states have control over issues such as education and health care. The states also have the right to ratify constitutional amendments, which gives them a powerful role in the federal government.",
