  "input": "Issue: The Digital Divides in Education",
  "output": "I believe that the digital divides in education are an increasing problem that can have wide-reaching implications. With many schools and families facing economic and access barriers to technology, there is a great risk that students may not receive the same quality of education as their peers. This gap in access to online tools and resources can contribute to a widening achievement gap, and put students at a disadvantage when compared to those with better resources. We need to ensure that all students have access to the same quality of education, regardless of their economic or geographic location.",
