  "input": "",
  "output": "In cryptography, a private key is a secret code known only to a specific individual or system that allows the user to encrypt and decrypt data. The private key is mathematically related to the public key and is used to prove the identity of the message sender or receiver. It is used in conjunction with a digital signature or message authentication code (MAC) to provide proof of authenticity. Private keys are also used in conjuction with a digital certificate, to ensure that the user is legitimate.",
