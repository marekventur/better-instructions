  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a small island with a coastline surrounded by crystal blue waters. The island was abundant with remarkable wildlife, beautiful coral reefs and majestic trees that towered over the land. The people of the island lived in harmony with the nature that surrounded them, taking only what they needed and giving back when they could. \n\nOne day, the people of the island noticed the water around them was becoming murky and the coral was starting to dim. They called the elders to discuss what could be done to save their beloved island. After much debate and deliberation, the islanders made a bold decision to put the environment first. They implemented strict policy and launched programs to help care for their island home. \n\nThanks to their hard work and dedication, the water in the bay was crystal clear again and the coral was vibrant. The people of the island rediscovered their connection with the nature around them and spread their message to other islands. The people of the island had finally realized that the key to a sustainable future is to put the environment first.",
