  "instruction": "Explain why the cost of political TV advertising has doubled since 2004.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The cost of producing a TV commercial has become more affordable for local and state candidates, so they are now turning to television ads to reach voters. Additionally, interest groups have invested a large amount of money in TV ads for political and local ballot measures. Furthermore, the increase of presidential candidates this election cycle has also contributed to the rise in spending.",
