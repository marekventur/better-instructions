  "input": "",
  "output": "Both a left-wing and a right-wing political ideology have certain commonalities. Both ideologies value private property, individual rights, and a free market economy, but differ in terms of how those values should be implemented. Left-wing ideologies tend to be more supportive of a larger public sector and taxation, while right-wing ideologies are more likely to be pro-business and favor smaller government. Both ideologies emphasize personal freedom, but prioritize it differently.",
