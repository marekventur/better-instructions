  "input": "",
  "output": "The main features of a gossip protocol are that it relies on members of the network to forward and spread messages of a particular topic to other members of the network without requiring any centralized control or coordination. The messages are transmitted asynchronously, randomly and frequently throughout the network, using a \"gossip\" algorithm. It is an efficient way of disseminating information over large networks with very little overhead.",
