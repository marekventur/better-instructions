  "instruction": "How would you explain \"dark matter\" to an audience with no scientific background?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Dark matter is a mysterious form of matter that we can't directly detect, and it plays a major role in the structure and evolution of the universe. Although dark matter does not interact with light, it does interact with gravity, which means it has an effect on the things we can observe in the universe. Recent observations suggest that dark matter exerts a force on the matter we can detect and is responsible for the structure and mass of galaxies, as well as the accelerated expansion of the universe.",
