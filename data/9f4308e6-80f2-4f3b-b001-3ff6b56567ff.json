  "instruction": "Collect evidence to support a hypothesis",
  "input": "The hypothesis is: Plants grow better in soil than in water.",
  "output": "To collect evidence to support this hypothesis, one can conduct an experiment where the same type of plant is placed in two separate containers - one containing soil and the other containing water. After observing the growth rate of the two plants over a period of time, one can draw conclusions and compare the growth rate of both plants to determine which provides the better growing environment.",
