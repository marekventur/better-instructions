  "input": "",
  "output": "Online shopping can benefit consumers in several ways. Firstly, it offers more convenience than traditional shopping. Consumers have access to a much wider variety of products, and can shop anytime, anywhere. Additionally, there is often increased affordability as customers access discounts and offers which may not otherwise be available. Furthermore, customers can benefit from improved product information, reviews and ratings which give them more control over their purchasing decisions.",
