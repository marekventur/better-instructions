  "output": "The basic principles of thermodynamics are the first and second laws of thermodynamics, which state that energy is conserved and energy tends to move from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration. The third law of thermodynamics states that at absolute zero, when all thermal energy is gone, a perfect crystalline structure results. Finally, the zeroth law of thermodynamics states that two systems in thermal equilibrium with a third system are in thermal equilibrium with each other.",
