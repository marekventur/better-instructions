  "input": "",
  "output": "Three methods used to decontaminate soil are physical removal, bioremediation, and chemical treatment. Physical removal involves removal of contaminated soil and replacing it with uncontaminated soil. Bioremediation involves the use of special microorganisms to break down pollutants in contaminated soil. Chemical treatments involve the use of chemicals to convert pollutants into less hazardous substances.",
