  "instruction": "Given a situation, discuss the impacts of technology on the situation.",
  "input": "Due to the pandemic, virtual classrooms have been the primary source of education for children.",
  "output": "Technology has helped to ensure that education continues even in the midst of a pandemic, allowing students to access virtual classrooms with ease. It has enabled the continuity of learning by providing online tools, platforms, and educational resources to students. Technology has also enabled educational institutions to provide different learning models, like flipped classrooms and microlearning, and it can also facilitate collaboration among students and teachers. On the other hand, there are potential risks like cyberbullying, digital addiction, and security threats that must also be considered when relying exclusively on virtual classrooms to provide education.",
