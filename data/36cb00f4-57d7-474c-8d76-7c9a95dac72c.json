  "output": "It was a dark and stormy night. The skies were filled with thunder and lightning, and the wind howled through the trees. \n\nJack felt a chill go down his spine as he walked through the forest. He had heard stories of dragons that lived nearby and hunted any living thing that crossed their paths.\n\nSuddenly, Jack heard a deep roar coming from the sky. He looked up and saw a huge red dragon soaring through the night sky. Its wings spread wide and its claws ready to grab whatever was in its path.\n\nJack ran as fast as he could, avoiding the trees and weaving in and out of the shadows. The dragon chased after him, breathing out fire and slashing at him with its claws.\n\nJack's heart raced as he ran. He could feel the heat of the dragon's breath on his back, yet he managed to keep going.\n\nFinally, as Jack reached the edge of the forest, he spotted a cave opening. Gathering all his courage, he jumped into the cave and hid in the darkness.\n\nJack lay in the cave, panting heavily. He had escaped the dragon's clutches, but he felt certain that the dragon would be back soon. He would have to find a way to survive, or the dragon would surely get him.",
