  "output": "To optimize the code to increase efficiency, the best approach would be to use the Java 8 Stream API\u2019s Count() method, which uses internal iteration to count the number of times a certain element is present in the array, passing in 0 as the argument. The code could then be modified to the following to increase its efficiency:\n\nint count = (int)Arrays.stream(array).filter(i -> i == 0).count();",
