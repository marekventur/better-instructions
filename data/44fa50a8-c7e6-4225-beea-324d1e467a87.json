Compare the characters at the two pointers.\n4. If the characters are the same, move the two pointers towards the middle of the string.\n5. Repeat step 3 until either the two pointers reaches the middle or the characters are different.\n6. If the two pointers reach the middle of the string, the string is a palindrome. Else, it is not a palindrome.",
