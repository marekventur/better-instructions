  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between microwaves and ovens is the type of heat they use to cook food. Microwaves cook food using microwaves and are much faster than ovens, which cook food using conduction and convection. Ovens can cook more complex dishes than microwaves and can also cook larger amounts of food, but they take much longer than microwaves. Additionally, microwaves provide a more even cook, while ovens can create hot spots.",
