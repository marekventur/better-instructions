  "output": "The main steps of a scientific experiment include, formulating a hypothesis, creating and setting up an experiment, carrying out the experiment, collecting, analyzing and interpreting the data, and drawing a conclusion. The first step is to create a hypothesis, or an educated guess about what the experiment will prove. The experiment must then be set up. During the experiment, control and variables must be identified and measured data must be collected. After the experiment has been completed, the data collected must be analyzed and evaluated to determine the validity of the hypothesis. Finally, a conclusion is drawn based on the results of the experiment.",
