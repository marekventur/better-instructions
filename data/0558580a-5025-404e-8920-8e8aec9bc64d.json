  "output": "This soundscape is meant to evoke the feeling of summer. It consists of the sounds of crickets chirping, waves lapping against the shore, birds singing, children playing, and distant thunder. In the background is the sound of wind chimes and a quiet guitar melody, creating a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere. Together, these sounds create a unique soundscape that captures the beauty and joy of summer.",
