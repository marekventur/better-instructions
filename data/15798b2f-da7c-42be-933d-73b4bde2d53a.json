  "instruction": "Provide a possible use case for a voice recognition system.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A voice recognition system can be used to quickly and conveniently enable employees to search internally stored information or records. This can reduce the time spent using a keyboard or mouse to search for data and enable the employees to access information quickly and efficiently. An example of this would be allowing voice commands to be used to search through a company's internal documents, such as customer records, employee data, or financial information. Using voice commands to search through the company's internal document repository can save businesses time and help boost employee productivity.",
