  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a noble dragon in a small village in the kingdom. He was brave and strong, but he was also very lonely. One day, he stumbled upon a mysterious book in an ancient library. The book told the legendary story of a lost treasure hidden deep in the forest. The dragon was enticed by the possibility of finding this treasure and decided to embark on a grand and dangerous quest. \n\nThe dragon bravely ventured deep into the forest, looking for clues and searching for the lost treasure. Along the way, he encountered many mystical creatures, including a wise old wizard. The wizard warned him of the dangers he would face ahead and offered to help, although the dragon declined.\n\nAfter many days of searching, the dragon eventually found a hidden cave with a rundown door. Beyond the door was a secret room that held the lost treasure. The dragon was overjoyed by his success and took the treasure back to his village. He was rewarded for his bravery and endurance, and from then on, the dragon lived happily ever after with his newfound wealth.",
