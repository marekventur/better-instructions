  "input": "",
  "output": "Java and Python are two of the most popular programming languages today, but they have significant differences. Java is an object-oriented language, whereas Python is a scripting language. This means that Java requires more detailed commands to create programs, as each object must be defined and specified in Java code. Python, on the other hand, is much more flexible and does not require the same level of detail. Additionally, Java code is compiled, meaning that it must first be written and tested before it can be run, while Python code is interpreted, which can usually be run without the need for prior compilation. Java is also strongly statically typed, which means that type errors must be detected before the code is run, and Python is dynamically typed, which means that types of variables can be changed without prior detection.",
