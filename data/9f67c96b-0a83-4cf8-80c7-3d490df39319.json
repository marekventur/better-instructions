  "output": "Mongolia has the lowest population density of all countries in the world, with 2.7 people per square kilometer. It is a largely arid and sparsely populated country, mostly as a result of climate and geography. However, it is becoming increasingly urbanised, with some of its largest cities containing almost a quarter of the country's total population. Mongolia is also one of the few countries that maintain an nomadic traditional lifestyle.",
