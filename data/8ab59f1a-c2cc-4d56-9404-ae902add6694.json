  "output": "The Battle of Verdun was a major World War I battle fought between Germany and France in 1916. It lasted for 10 months, and resulted in over 700,000 casualties on both sides. The battle was an example of the new \"attrition\" tactics being developed, with devastating results for both sides. The German goal of capturing the Verdun fortresses and forcing the French to surrender was unsuccessful, resulting in the war continuing for another two years.",
