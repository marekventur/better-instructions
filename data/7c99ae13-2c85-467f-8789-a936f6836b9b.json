  "output": "People are living longer today than in the past due to advances in medicine, improved sanitation, better nutrition, advances in technology, and improved living conditions. Medical technologies such as vaccines, antibiotics, and improved treatments for health conditions have enabled people to live longer, healthier lives. Improved sanitation has allowed for better hygiene and less spread of contagious diseases. Better nutrition has resulted in stronger immune systems and fewer deficiencies. Advances in technology, from air conditioning to household appliances, have made life easier and more comfortable. Finally, improved living conditions, such as cleaner air and water and better housing, have enabled people to experience a higher quality of life.",
