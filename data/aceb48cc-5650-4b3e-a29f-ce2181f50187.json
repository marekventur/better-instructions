  "input": "",
  "output": "For the upcoming season, one of the top fashion trends will be monochromatic looks. Pieces like matching coat and trousers sets, or allover tonal suiting, or monochromatic dresses featuring pleats, ruffles and volume will be popular. For color palettes, look for bold, eye-catching hues like yellow, green, and red but also timeless neutrals like black, grey, and navy. Also look for styling elements such as different textures, pleats and layering for a more dynamic and modern look.",
