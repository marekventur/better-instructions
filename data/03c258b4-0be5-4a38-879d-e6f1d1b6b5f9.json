  "output": "Jessica was a college student who lived in the campus dorms. After a long year of studying, and exams, she was finally finished - and ready to depart for the summer. She gathered her belongings and got ready to move out and head home. \n\nOn her last day in the dorms, she went to every room, saying goodbye to all her friends. She was a little bit sad to be leaving, as she was going to miss all the fun activities and late night conversations. \n\nBut she was also excited for the summer to start. She couldn\u2019t wait to be home and spend time with her family and friends, and enjoy the sun and warm weather. \n\nFinally, she was ready to leave. She said one last goodbye to her friends and then she was off. With that, she was done with her freshman year of college and ready for the summer.",
