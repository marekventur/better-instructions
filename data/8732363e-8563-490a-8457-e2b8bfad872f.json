  "input": "",
  "output": "One ethical issue relating to the use of AI systems is the potential for discrimination in decision-making. AI systems can be built to maximize profits for companies at the expense of human labor and other labor and ethical considerations. AI systems can also be used by governments to enforce discriminatory policies, or by businesses to manipulate user behavior for their own gain. Additionally, AI systems can often be tuned in ways that produce biased results, as algorithms are written by humans and thus reflect their own biases, whether consciously or unintentionally. This can potentially lead to unfair outcomes for individuals.",
