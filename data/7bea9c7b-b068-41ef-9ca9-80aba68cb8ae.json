  "output": "Defensive strategies in basketball aim to disrupt the offense\u2019s rhythm and timing. The most successful strategies include the \u2018help defense\u2019, which requires defenders to work together to help each other. Another important strategy is communication between defenders, as well as keeping the focus on the player with the ball. Making sure not to create too much space between teammates is also important when defending. Finally, a good strategy for closing off passing lanes and helping protect the basket is for the defenders to stay between their man and the basket.",
