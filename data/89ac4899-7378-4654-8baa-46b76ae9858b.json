  "input": "A new study has found that sea levels are rising faster than previously estimated, due to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica calling into question how much time we have to respond to climate change. The results, published in Nature, show that since 1992, sea levels have risen an average of 3.2 millimeters per year, significantly higher than the previous estimates of 2.8 millimeters. To calculate this number, the researchers used satellite data that more accurately measures the rising levels than ever before. The melting ice sheets, which together account for 75 percent of all the ice loss, have caused the situation to be worse than previously estimated.",
  "output": "A new study published in Nature has found that sea levels have been rising faster than previously estimated, at an average rate of 3.2 millimeters per year since 1992. This significant jump can be attributed to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The satellite data used to come up with these numbers provides a more reliable assessment than ever before. The two ice sheets together account for 75 percent of all the ice loss, which only worsens the already bad situation.",
