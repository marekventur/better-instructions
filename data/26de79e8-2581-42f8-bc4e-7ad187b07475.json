  "instruction": "Given a hypothetical situation, design a plan to overcome it.",
  "input": "Your business partner pulled out of the project and you're understaffed.",
  "output": "To overcome the challenge of being understaffed, I would first put out an urgent public call for new team members. This would allow me to enlist the help of qualified individuals who have the necessary skills to take on the role of the former partner. Next, I would look for freelance workers or contractors who can help out for a short period of time. Finally, if needed, I would reorganize the current team's workload to ensure tasks are evenly distributed.",
