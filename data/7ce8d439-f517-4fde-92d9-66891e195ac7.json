  "input": "",
  "output": "A pooling layer is a layer in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is responsible for down-sampling the input and extracting meaningful features from the output of the convolutional layer. Pooling layers achieve this by applying a specific window size to a particular section of the input and taking either the largest or average value from the window to create an output. This allows for simpler and more effective feature extraction and helps reduce the overall computational complexity of the network.",
