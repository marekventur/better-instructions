  "output": "The music was blasting so loud it almost felt like being in the middle of a nightclub. The walls vibrated with the sound and you could hardly hear yourself think. The dance floor was swarming with people, moving their bodies to the rhythm of the beat and letting the music take over their minds. The atmosphere was electric, and it was impossible to resist the energy of the party.",
