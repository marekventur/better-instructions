  "output": "In order for a bill to become a law, it must go through a number of stages. First, the bill must be drafted and presented in the legislature. After being introduced in the legislature, the bill is discussed and debated. If a majority of the legislature approves of the bill, it is voted on and passed. After the vote, the bill is sent to the governor for approval or veto. If it is approved by the governor, the bill is sent to the Secretary of State to be filed, and finally, it is published as a law.",
