  "input": "",
  "output": "Wireless communication works by transmitting signals through the air without the use of a physical medium such as a wire or cable. The signals are usually transmitted at radio frequencies or infrared frequencies, which are used to carry data between two or more devices. This enables remote communication without the need for any physical connection between the sending and receiving devices.",
