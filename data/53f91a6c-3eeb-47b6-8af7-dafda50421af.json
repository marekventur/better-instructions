  "input": "",
  "output": "According to Christensen's theory, there are three levels of disruption. \n\nThe first level of disruption is low-end disruption, where a firm enters the market serving the needs of customers whose needs are not being met by existing technology. \n\nThe second level of disruption is new-market disruption, where a firm offers a product that consumes a new market that was previously nonexistent. \n\nThe third level of disruption is called sustained disruption, which is when an established firm successfully disrupts itself by maintaining the same set of users while introducing the latest technologies.",
