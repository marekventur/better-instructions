  "input": "",
  "output": "The phrase \"you reap what you sow\" means that you will get in return what you have put into something; your actions, decisions, and words will have consequences and you will experience those consequences in time. This phrase is often used in the context of moral and ethical behavior. It means that if you act responsibly, live an honest life, and treat others with respect, you can expect positive results; conversely, if you act selfishly, dishonestly, and disrespectfully then you will eventually pay the price.",
