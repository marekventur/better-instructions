  "output": "Content-based filtering is a machine learning technique used to recommend items to users based on their similarity to previously liked items. The process involves extracting features from items in the dataset and computing a similarity score between items. The items that have the highest similarity score are recommended to the user. In addition, content-based filtering also takes into account user preference for particular item features to refine the recommendations.",
