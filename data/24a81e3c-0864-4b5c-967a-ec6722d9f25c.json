  "output": "The Catcher in the Rye follows the life of Holden Caulfield, a disillusioned 16-year old from New York City. After getting expelled from his school, Holden faces depression and various challenges as he attempts to make sense of his life. As Holden journeys through the streets of New York, he comes across many interesting people, including his old friend Ackley, the prostitute Sunny and his little sister Phoebe, who helps him better understand the real world. Throughout his journey, Holden finally comes to terms with the fact that he is an immature teenager who succumbs to his own naive expectations about life and adulthood; his thoughts are revealed to be misguided as he contemplates suicide and contemplates his farewell to innocence. The Catcher in the Rye serves as a coming of age novel, with Holden being the protagonist who finds himself in various tribulations until he eventually accepts his fate and finds purpose in life.",
