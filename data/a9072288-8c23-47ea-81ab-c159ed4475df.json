  "instruction": "What are the effects of climate change on sea levels?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change is causing sea levels to rise due to increased temperatures that cause melting of both glaciers and polar ice caps. This causes more water in the ocean, which makes sea levels higher than they would be without climate change. Rising sea levels put coastal cities and small islands at risk of flooding, and can have impacts on the ocean\u2019s ecosystems. Changes in weather patterns due to climate change can also cause changes in ocean currents, leading to changes in species\u2019 habitat and behavior.",
