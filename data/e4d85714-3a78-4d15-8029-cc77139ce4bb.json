  "input": "",
  "output": "A line graph could be used to effectively show the evolution of the stock market over time. The horizontal axis should be used to denote a timeline, while the vertical axis should represent the changing performance of the stock market. Different colored lines could be used to indicate different stock market indices, while trend lines could illustrate the overall direction of the market. The graph could also incorporate annotations and labels to provide more context and explanation of the data.",
