  "input": "",
  "output": "Print media and digital media differ in a number of ways. Print media is a physical medium, typically involving paper or other materials, while digital media is a digital format displayed on a computer or other electronic device. Additionally, print media is typically static and immutable, while digital media can be updated and edited instantly. Another key difference is that print media is typically more expensive to produce and distribute than digital media, while digital media can often be shared more quickly and widely. Finally, print media often requires greater focus and attention to consume, while digital media can generally be consumed more quickly, making it ideal for short-form content.",
