  "output": "Social media is a powerful tool for human connection because it allows people to stay in touch with each other across vast distances, easily share information and ideas, and access a wide range of resources. It has been used to spark activism and awareness, bring people together for collective action, and as a medium for engaging in debates and exchanging opinions. All of this shows that social media can enable meaningful conversations, amplify voices, enable collaboration, and create powerful social bonds.",
