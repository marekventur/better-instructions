  "output": "The color-coding system used in the office is used to easily identify different areas and items. Red indicates danger, green indicates functioning well, yellow indicates caution is needed, and blue indicates a specific department or area. This system is used to indicate the status of various items in the office, such as a printer being ready to use (green) or a machine needing repair (red). This system helps make it easier for co-workers to identify if something needs attention or can be used.",
