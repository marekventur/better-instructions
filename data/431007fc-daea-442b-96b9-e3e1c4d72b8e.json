  "input": "",
  "output": "Metamorphosis is the process by which a caterpillar transforms itself into a butterfly. The caterpillar grows and moults multiple times, and eventually creates a cocoon around itself. Inside the cocoon, its body breaks down and is replaced by a new body. After a few days, the caterpillar emerges from its cocoon as a butterfly with beautiful wings.",
