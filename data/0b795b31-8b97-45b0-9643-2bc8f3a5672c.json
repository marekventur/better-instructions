  "output": "Descriptive writing is a style of writing that uses vivid words to create a detailed picture in the reader's mind. It is often used to make a scene, character, or idea come alive, as it uses sensory details such as smells, sounds, and visuals to evoke a reaction. Descriptive writing often uses imagery, metaphor, and simile to bring to life the characters and stories in the story.",
