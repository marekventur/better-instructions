  "input": "",
  "output": "A scalar quantity is a one-dimensional quantity that is only defined by a magnitude, while a vector quantity is a multiple-dimensional quantity that is defined by both magnitude and direction. Scalar quantities include speed, mass, temperature, energy and volume, while vector quantities include velocity, acceleration, force and momentum. A scalar quantity can be represented in one dimension or unit, while a vector quantity always requires two or more units to describe the magnitude and direction.",
