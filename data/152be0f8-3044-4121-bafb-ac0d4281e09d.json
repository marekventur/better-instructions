  "output": "A few years ago, I was working on a project that had a tight deadline. I noticed that my teammates weren't able to finish their tasks on time, so I decided to take the initiative and take up those tasks as my own. By working longer hours and managing my time efficiently, I was able to finish all of the tasks ahead of schedule and deliver the project within the deadline.",
