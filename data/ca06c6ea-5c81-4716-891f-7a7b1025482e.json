  "input": "",
  "output": "Space exploration does more harm than good. We waste millions of dollars every year on space exploration. While the potential of these missions is exciting, the cost to our government and taxpayers is simply too high. The money spent on space exploration could instead be used to address more pressing needs such as poverty, hunger and lack of health care and education. Furthermore, the environmental consequences of space exploration have been largely neglected. Launching rockets and satellites creates noise pollution and releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, threatening the health of our planet. Moreover, private companies are becoming more involved in space exploration, yet they are largely unaccountable to the public and do not have to meet the social, environmental, or economic standards that publicly funded organizations do. In conclusion, much of the money spent on space exploration would be better invested in programs that directly benefit the human race.",
