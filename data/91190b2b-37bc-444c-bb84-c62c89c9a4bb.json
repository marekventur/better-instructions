  "output": "A long time ago, there were two best friends who were inseparable. They went through thick and thin together, always having each other\u2019s backs. However, after several years of friendship, they both started to grow apart. \n\nThe conflict began when both of them decided to pursue their dreams. One chose to be a successful entrepreneur while the other decided to take the path of an artist. With their goals having collided, their friendship crumbled and ended in rivalry. \n\nThe two often found themselves competing against each other in order to prove who was better. Sometimes this was harmless, such as comparing their grades in school or competing in physical activities, but it soon escalated to a full-fledged feud. They would sabotage each other\u2019s projects, harshly criticize each other\u2019s work, or mock each other\u2019s successes. Their two vibrant lives were slowly turning sour as the rivalry grew between them.\n\nHowever, after a long and grueling competition, the two rivals managed to resolve their differences and accepted that there was enough room for wealth and fame in this world. They agreed to remain friends and to never forget the mutual goals that brought them together in the first place. They managed to rekindle their friendship and once again share the same dreams, goals, and vision. They succeeded in being rivals and also managed to be friends.",
