  "instruction": "Provide an argument about why the death penalty should not be used.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One argument against the death penalty is that it does not have a deterrent effect on crime. Numerous studies show that the death penalty is not a more effective deterrent than the alternative of life imprisonment. Additionally, there is the risk that innocent people could be executed, as has happened in the past. This risk of wrongful execution is a significant issue, as there is no way to undo the damage caused by an execution. Finally, the death penalty is cruel and inhumane; it reduces the criminal to less than human status.",
