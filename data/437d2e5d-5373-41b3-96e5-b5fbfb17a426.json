  "output": "The impact of online streaming on traditional television viewing has been considerable. Online streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime have grown increasingly popular over the last decade, and this has had a major effect on traditional TV consumption. In particular, there has been a noticeable shift in television viewers away from linear TV and towards streaming services. This shift has led to an overall decrease in traditional television viewership, as well as a change in the types of content being consumed. For example, streaming services tend to offer much more variety and choice than traditional television channels, which has led to an increased focus on genres such as drama and comedy. Consequently, this has had an effect on the types of content being produced for traditional channels, with a greater focus on reality and sports programming. Overall, the prevalence of online streaming has certainly had an impact on traditional television viewing.",
