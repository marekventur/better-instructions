  "input": "",
  "output": "People find it difficult to commit for a variety of reasons. One reason is the fear of making the wrong decision. People are afraid of being stuck in an unhappy relationship or career. They also worry about giving up something else for the commitment, such as freedom or personal growth. Additionally, some people are simply not ready to make a lifelong commitment, or may be dealing with trust issues.",
