  "instruction": "Develop an AI model to classify different types of cars.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The AI model should be able to accurately classify different types of cars, such as sedans, coupes, hatchbacks, SUVs and pickup trucks. The model should use a variety of data sources to identify images of cars, such as images from car shows, images from magazines and webpages, as well as other visual cues from the environment. In addition, the model should also leverage text data from the source of the image, such as the make, model, year and other specific details about the car.",
