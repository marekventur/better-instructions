Her father, Carl Lee Hailey, takes the law into his own hands and attempts to assassinate the two perpetrators. When his trial comes to court, the county is embroiled in a chaotic trial that captures the attention of the world. With the help of his lawyer, Jake Brigance, Carl Lee is able to bring to light the injustices faced by African-Americans under a system of unequal laws and enforcement.
