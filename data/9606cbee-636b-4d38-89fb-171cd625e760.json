  "input": "",
  "output": "Handwashing is important to prevent the spread of disease because it decreases harmful bacteria from spreading from one person to another. By washing your hands with soap and water, you can reduce the amount of bacteria on your hands and prevent the bacteria from entering your body through your eyes, nose, or mouth. Additionally, washing your hands often helps reduce the spread of bacterial and viral infections by preventing the transfer of germs to other people and surfaces.",
