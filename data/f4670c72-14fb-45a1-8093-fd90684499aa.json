Conservation includes reducing water use through efficient fixtures, low-flow appliances, and other measures. Reuse involves capturing used water and recycling it for other purposes such as irrigation, laundry, or toilet flushing. Recycle includes treating wastewater for direct reuse for human consumption or for industrial and agricultural applications.",
