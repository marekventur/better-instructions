  "instruction": "Why are planets round?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Planets are round because they are affected by the force of gravity. Gravity pulls the material in the planet together, which causes it to become denser in the center. Over time, this pulling force causes the planet to take on a spherical shape, with the denser material forming a core in the center of the planet and the less dense material forming an outer shell.",
