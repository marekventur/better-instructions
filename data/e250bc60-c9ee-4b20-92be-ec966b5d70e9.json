  "instruction": "Compare and contrast a hybrid and electric car",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A hybrid car is powered by both a gasoline engine and electric motor, while an electric car is powered by electricity alone. Hybrid cars typically have better fuel efficiency than traditional gasoline cars and generate fewer emissions, while electric cars are even more fuel efficient and create almost no emissions. Hybrid cars also typically require less maintenance than electric cars, but electric cars require less overall cost in fuel and maintenance over the long run.",
