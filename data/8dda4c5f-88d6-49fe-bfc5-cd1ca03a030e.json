  "instruction": "Design an algorithm to detect plagiarism in academic papers.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm should cross-reference a given paper with a library of academic papers and sources to compare for any shared content. If detected, the algorithm should be able to calculate a plagiarism score which could be used to rate the authors\u2019 work. Additionally, the algorithm should recognize when sources are properly cited and offer feedback on the accuracy of the citations.",
