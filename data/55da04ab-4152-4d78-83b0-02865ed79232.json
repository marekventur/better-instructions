  "input": "",
  "output": "The advantages of using a machine learning model for text summarization include improved accuracy, more relevant summaries, and the ability to achieve higher quality summaries in less time. On the other hand, the disadvantages of machine learning models include higher costs, the need for a large training dataset, and errors in summary generation. Additionally, machine learning models can be difficult to interpret due to lack of insight into how the models arrive at their summarization decisions.",
