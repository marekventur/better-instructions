  "input": "",
  "output": "Art can be a powerful tool for expressing political opinions. One example is the mural created by artist Shepard Fairey in Los Angeles in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The mural featured images of civil rights leaders and political figures from different movements and eras, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Angela Davis. By creating this powerful, large-scale mural, Fairey was able to express support for the Black Lives Matter cause while also drawing attention to the intersectional nature of political struggle.",
