  "output": "An example of natural selection is the process by which species adapt to their environment over time. For example, a population of finches in an environment with lots of seeds may evolve over time to have larger beaks to better crack open the seeds. Over time, these larger beaked finches will make up the majority of the population, since they have a better chance of survival and reproduction in their environment.",
