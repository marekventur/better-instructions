  "input": "Biomass is organic material that comes from living or recently living organisms. It can be derived from both land-based and aquatic biomass. Common sources of biomass are plants and their byproducts, energy crops, waste from agriculture and forestry, and byproducts from food processing sectors. Biomass can be used for energy in the form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuels. It can also be used to produce bioplastics, biochemicals, and biofuels. Biomass is an important source of renewable energy and a major contributor to the fight against climate change.",
  "output": "1. Biomass is organic material from living organisms, such as plants and their byproducts, energy crops, agricultural and forestry waste, and food processing byproducts. It can be used for energy in the form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuels, as well as bioplastics, biochemicals, and biofuels.\n2. Organic material derived from living organisms, including plants and their related products, energy crops, agricultural and forestry waste, and food processing byproducts, can be used to create renewable energies and fight climate change.\n3. Renewable energy and a major contribution to the fight against climate change can be sourced from organic material of living organisms \u2013 like plants, energy crops, and waste from agriculture and the food processing industry.\n4. Biomass is derived from living organisms, and can form renewable energy sources such as solid, liquid, or gaseous fuels, as well as bioplastics, biochemicals, and biofuels. This is an effective tool in the battle against climate change.\n5. Organic material from living, recently living, and even dead organisms can be converted into sources of renewable energy in the form of solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels. These sources can also be used to form bioplastics, biochemicals, and even biofuels, which makes it a valuable contender in the global climate change mitigation effort.",
