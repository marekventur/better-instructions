  "output": "Designing a house in 3D that looks like Hogwarts requires a lot of creativity and knowledge of 3D modeling software. First, it is important to research and gather as many references of the Hogwarts castle as possible. This includes researching both the interior and exterior of the castle, as well as how all the elements work together. Once all the research is done, you can use a 3D modeling software to start creating the 3D model by adding in walls, floors, windows, and other elements that make up the castle. You can also use different textures and materials to make the model look more realistic, then use lighting and render settings to create the best possible result. Finally, you can add extra details like trees, vegetation, and furniture to make the model look even more realistic.",
