  "output": "Autonomous robots are computer-controlled machines that are programmed to carry out a specific task without any human input, enabling new levels of efficiency, accuracy and reliability. Autonomous robots are increasingly used in a variety of industries, from manufacturing, where they can assemble complex components with precision and consistent quality, to healthcare, where they can assist with medical tests and procedures, to security, where they can monitor large areas and keep people and property safe. Autonomous robots can also reduce errors and increase safety in dangerous or hazardous environments, such as during inspections or repairs of industrial processes. Thanks to their versatility, autonomous robots are set to revolutionize the way we work, enabling us to make tasks simpler, faster and ultimately, more enjoyable.",
