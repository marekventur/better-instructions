  "instruction": "Write a detailed explanation about the concept of tides.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon, Sun and the rotation of the Earth. The gravitational force of the moon is the strongest and causes the most noticeable effects on the levels of the ocean and seas. Each day, the moon's gravitational force causes two high tides (when the ocean level is highest) and two low tides (when the ocean level is lowest). The Sun's gravitational force also affects the tides but to a lesser degree. The exact same location experiences two high and two low tides each day, however the different phases of the moon cause the tides to vary in severity.",
