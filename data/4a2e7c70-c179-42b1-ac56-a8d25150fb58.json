  "output": "Good evening everyone! I am here to talk about some of the important life lessons we should all keep in mind. Firstly, I believe that nothing great happens overnight. Developing skills, building relationships, and accomplishing goals takes time and effort. Secondly, nothing has greater power than the power of love and kindness. Lastly, I think resilience is the most valuable trait one can have. We should stay focused and never give up, even when faced with set-backs or disappointments. Thank you.",
