  "output": "A common method for selecting features for supervised machine learning is to use domain knowledge and experience to select the most relevant features for the task. Another method is to use a feature selection algorithm to identify the most important features. The algorithm can select the most important features through a combination of wrappers, filters, and embedded methods.",
