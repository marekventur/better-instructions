  "output": "Brachiosaurus was a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in the Late Jurassic period, around 154 to 150 million years ago. It was one of the largest land animals ever to have lived, with an estimated length of 26 meters and weighing 33 to 70 tons. Its name translates to \"arm lizard\", due to its unusually long forelimbs. Brachiosaurus had a large, scoop-shaped, beak-like snout and peg-toothed jaws for plucking food from trees. Its neck was also very long in proportion to its body, 5 to 8 times longer than its back. The back was also very tall and its tail was held off the ground while walking. It was a quadreped with four sturdy legs and a tall, quadrupedal stance. Its rear legs were slightly longer then its front legs and its feet were short and blunt. It had relatively short arms and hands which ended in five digits with claws. It had scales on its skin and is believed to have eaten an herbivorous diet of low lying plants and foliage.",
