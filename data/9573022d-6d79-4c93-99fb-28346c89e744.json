  "output": "Rock-paper-scissors is a game where two players simultaneously choose from one of three possible outcomes - rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same outcome, the game is usually a draw. The game is a good way to settle disputes and make decisions, as there are equal chances for either player to win. It can also be a fun way to pass the time with friends.",
