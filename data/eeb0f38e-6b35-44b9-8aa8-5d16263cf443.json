  "input": "",
  "output": "The best strategy to save money for a high-ticket product is to set a budget, start saving, and work towards that goal. Set aside a portion of your income for a few months and stick to it. Automate your savings by setting up automatic transfers from your paycheck or checking account to a savings account designated for the item. Consider taking on a side job or focusing on freelance work to earn extra income. It may also be helpful to cut back on unnecessary spending to make sure you have enough funds. Finally, look for deals and discounts that can help you reach your goal faster.",
