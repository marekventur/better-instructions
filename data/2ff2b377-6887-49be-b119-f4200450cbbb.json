  "output": "Evolution is the process by which populations of organisms change over time in response to their environment and genetic factors. It is driven by natural selection, which is the process where individuals with certain advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce than others. Over time, these traits will become more frequent in the population, resulting in changes in the genetic composition. These changes eventually lead to new species and the appearance of new traits.",
