  "output": "Once upon a time, there was an elephant named Elmer who lived in the jungle. Elmer was a big, gray elephant with long eyelashes and a trunk that was always ready for a hug. Every morning, Elmer would go on a long walk around the forest with his friends: the giraffe, the zebra, and the lion. On their way, they would visit the river and make new friends. Elmer was always the most gentle and kind of his friends, and he was always helpful whenever his friends needed something. One day, Elmer's friends decided to have a race. Elmer was the one who won, but he was too shy to tell anyone that he had won. However, his friends knew that Elmer had won and they cheered for him! Elmer was so happy and proud of himself. That was the best day ever for Elmer!",
