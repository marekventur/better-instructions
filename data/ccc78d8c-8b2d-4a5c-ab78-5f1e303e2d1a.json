  "input": "",
  "output": "One technique to speed up a monotonous task is to break it into smaller pieces. For example, if the task involves counting a large number of items, it can be broken into smaller counts that can be done simultaneously. Also, setting a specific goal or reward for achieving a certain amount of work can also help in motivating yourself to complete the task. Additionally, breaking the task into smaller pieces can also help to reduce boredom, because it gives the person something new to focus on at any given time.",
