  "output": "John had been dreaming of the same thing for weeks, although each night the details were different. He dreamt of a strange darkness, something he couldn't identify but that he found truly frightening. So when John woke up that morning, he was filled with a sense of dread. He knew something bad was about to happen and he had no idea what it was. He just felt that whatever it was, it would be far worse than anything he had ever experienced before.",
