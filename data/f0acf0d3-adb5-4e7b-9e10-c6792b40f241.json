  "input": "",
  "output": "Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas because it absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This property of carbon dioxide traps the heat in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, acting like a blanket and increasing the surface temperature. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect. Therefore, too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can lead to extreme surface warming and climate change.",
