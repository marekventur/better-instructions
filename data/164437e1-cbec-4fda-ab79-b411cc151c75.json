  "output": "The queen\u2019s gambit is a popular chess opening strategy that starts with white moving the king's pawn two squares ahead. Black typically responds by moving their own king's pawn two squares ahead. White will then move their queen's pawn two squares ahead, leading to a large advantage for white if black does not know how to counter it. White will then move their dark bishop to the fifth rank, threatening the f7 pawn, which focuses white's attack against black's king's side. Black should counter by moving their own dark bishop to the fourth or sixth rank and by castling.",
