  "output": "It was the coldest night of the year. The wind whipped up a storm outside, rattling the windows and doors of the old house. Inside, the fire in the living room danced, casting eerie shadows against the walls. I sat up with a start, staring into the darkness, watching as a figure emerged from the darkness. It was tall and thin, wearing a thick long coat that was well past its prime. As it moved closer I locked eyes with it, shocked by the intensity of hatred that I felt in its gaze. It stopped abruptly, our eyes locking for what felt like an eternity. I had the feeling that something bad was about to happen and that the cold night was about to become much colder.",
