  "instruction": "Provide a solution for reducing traffic congestion in big cities.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One potential solution for reducing traffic congestion in big cities is to encourage the use of public transportation by providing low-cost or free transit options. This could include improving existing public transportation systems, expanding services to provide more coverage, or introducing programs such as ride-sharing or bike-sharing for short distances. To further encourage the usage of these services, governments can incentivize riders by providing rewards, loyalty points, discounts, or credit-based solutions. Other potential solutions include improving road infrastructure, developing comprehensive traffic management systems, implementing congestion pricing, and introducing laws to restrict private vehicle movement during peak hours.",
