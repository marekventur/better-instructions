  "instruction": "Describe what a tardigrade living in a desert looks like.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Tardigrades living in a desert are small, segmented creatures with eight legs, a round body and a head that is slightly smaller than the rest of the body. Their body is covered with a cuticle, which is a waxy substance that helps protect them from desiccation. Their color ranges from brown, yellow or white and they have four clawed feet which helps them to anchor onto sandy or rocky terrain. They are able to survive in extreme temperatures, low oxygen levels and dehydration. Tardigrades in a desert environment also have the ability to curl themselves up into a tight ball, to protect themselves from the harsh environment.",
