  "output": "Climate change is an urgent challenge that we cannot afford to ignore. The devastating effects of global warming are already impacting people and their livelihoods, with the potential of driving millions of species to extinction, if not addressed. The scientific consensus is that the main cause of climate change is human-made, caused by emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. We have already allowed the temperature of the Earth to rise by 1.2 \u00baC since pre-industrial times, so immediate steps must be taken to reduce emissions and slow the effects of climate change. Even if we are unable to reach agreements on international levels, individuals must take the lead in becoming part of the solution to global warming.",
