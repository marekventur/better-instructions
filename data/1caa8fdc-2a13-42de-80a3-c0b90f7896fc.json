  "input": "",
  "output": "A perpetual calendar is a calendar with the same dates and days of the week in the same order every year. It includes leap years, which are years with an extra day to account for the extra day in the leap year. On the other hand, a non-perpetual calendar is a calendar that changes from year to year and is usually based on a specific system of months, number of days, etc. For example, the Gregorian calendar is non-perpetual as it has variable lengths for different months and does not, for example, have a leap year at all times.",
