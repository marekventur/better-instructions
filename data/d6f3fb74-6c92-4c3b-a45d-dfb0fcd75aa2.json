  "output": "The most common types of insulation used in buildings include fiberglass, spray foam, cellulose, mineral wool, and foam board. Fiberglass insulation is made from glass fibers and is most often used as batts. Spray foam insulation is sprayed into walls and ceilings and provides a tight, air-sealed envelope that is effective in controlling air infiltration. Cellulose is made from recycled paper and is usually installed as loose-fill insulation in walls and attics. Mineral wool insulation is made from natural stone or slag and is often used in exterior walls. Foam board insulation is made from polystyrene, polyurethane, or polyisocyanurate, usually available in rigid panels, and is commonly used for exterior walls, roofs, and foundations.",
