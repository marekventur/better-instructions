  "input": "Summary: This paper describes a novel deep learning technique called Generative Autowavelets (GAW) and examines its uses in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. GAW is a combination of an autoencoder and wavelet transformer, meaning it can both compress features in text and enable structured extraction of these features.",
  "output": "This paper introduces Generative Autowavelets (GAW), a new deep learning technique that combines autoencoders and wavelet transforms in order to compress and extract relevant features from text for natural language processing tasks.",
