  "output": "Friendship smiles in our faces, \nGiving us love and inspiration. \nIt comes with joy without fail, \nThat friendship's love will never fail. \n\nWe cling to each other in good times and bad, \nFriendship always pushing us forward and never holding us back. \nIt's an anchor in storms and a joy on bays, \nA refuge in sorrow and a guiding light in days. \n\nFriendship guides us through hardships and tears, \nGiving us strength, joy, and hope that never fears. \nIt's a beautiful thing of trust and care, \nSpreading smiles and inspiration wherever it will fare.",
