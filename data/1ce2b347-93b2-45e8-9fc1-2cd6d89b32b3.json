  "input": "",
  "output": "A blockchain ledger is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are secured by cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. The data stored on a blockchain ledger is resistant to modification, making it a secure and reliable system. This data can also be used to form a permanent record of activity such as payments, exchanges, and ultimately, contracts.",
