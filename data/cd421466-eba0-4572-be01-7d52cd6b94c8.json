  "output": "Substitutable technology refers to a system in which one technology can be replaced by another. It can be used to measure the degree of competition in certain markets and describe the potential impact of new products or services. Technology substitution can occur when customers find alternative products or services that can fulfill their needs. In the technology world, there is often intense competition between many different products and services that provide similar features. With substitutable technology, customers will be able to switch from one technology solution to another with relative ease.",
