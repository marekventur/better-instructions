  "input": "",
  "output": "The four main sub-fields of AI are: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), Machine Learning (ML) and Robotics. NLP is used to analyze and interpret language in different forms such as text, voice, and video. Computer Vision (CV) is the application of machine learning to interpret and understand images. Machine learning (ML) involves algorithms that enable machines to train themselves to identify patterns and make decisions. Robotics is the application of AI to physical machines and systems so that they can carry out complex tasks autonomously.",
