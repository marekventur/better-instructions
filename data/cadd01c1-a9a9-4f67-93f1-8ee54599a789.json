  "output": "The Cuban Missile Crisis was a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union in October 1962 over the installation of nuclear-armed Soviet missiles in Cuba. The 13-day crisis began when U.S. President John F. Kennedy was informed by his intelligence of the missiles and ended with an arrangement to dismantle them and return them to the Soviet Union. As a result of this crisis, both nations agreed to become more involved in international diplomacy and disarm their nuclear weapons.",
