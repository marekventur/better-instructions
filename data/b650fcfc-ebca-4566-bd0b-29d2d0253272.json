  "input": "Genetic Algorithm",
  "output": "Genetic algorithms are a form of artificial intelligence that mimic the processes of natural selection and evolution to solve complex optimization problems. The main factors that make genetic algorithms successful are the principles of selection, heredity, and mutation. Selection allows more successful solutions from the population to be preserved and reused. Heredity creates combinations of existing solutions to generate new solutions. And mutation allows random changes to create new solutions that can potentially improve upon existing ones.",
