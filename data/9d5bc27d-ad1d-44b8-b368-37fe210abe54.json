  "input": "",
  "output": "The most dangerous form of modern slavery is human trafficking, which is defined as the transport of people for exploitation for the purposes of forced labor or commercial sex work. Traffickers use force, fraud and coercion to trap victims in exploitative situations. Every year, millions of people around the world are susceptible to trafficking, making it one of the most profitable and pervasive forms of modern slavery. Victims are subjected to physical and psychological abuse, and are often denied their basic human rights such as health care and education. Trafficking is driven by the profits made from exploitation, and its victims face long-term consequences such as trauma, social isolation and poverty.",
