  "output": "One method to reduce stress in a job interview is to practice common interview questions beforehand. This can help you become familiar with the types of questions you may be asked, as well as give you an opportunity to practice your responses. Additionally, it can be beneficial to dress appropriately, remain focused and maintain good eye contact. These may seem like minor details, but they can help you feel more confident and relaxed. It is also helpful to take a few deep breaths and practice mindful relaxation techniques before and during the interview, as this can help calm your nervous energy.",
