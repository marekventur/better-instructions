  "input": "",
  "output": "An obligate aerobe is an organism that needs oxygen to survive, while an obligate anaerobe is an organism that cannot survive in the presence of oxygen. Obligate aerobes are organisms that use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor for their respiration process, while obligate anaerobes are organisms that do not use oxygen and have the ability to use other electron acceptors besides oxygen.",
