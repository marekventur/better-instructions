  "output": "Ice cream and frozen yogurt are both popular frozen desserts, but they are different in both taste and nutrition. Ice cream is made with cream and is usually high in fat, while frozen yogurt is made with yogurt and is typically lower in fat. Ice cream has a richer, creamier flavor, while frozen yogurt is light and creamy. Both desserts are available in a variety of flavors, but ice cream often has a higher sugar content than frozen yogurt.",
