  "instruction": "Come up with a classification model to determine whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a paid service or not.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The classification model should be able to take in data related to a customer such as demographics, usage information, and behavioral data. It should then use this data to accurately determine whether a customer is likely to subscribe to the paid service or not. The model should also be able to update its predictions over time as new data is available and identify the most important features influencing subscription.",
