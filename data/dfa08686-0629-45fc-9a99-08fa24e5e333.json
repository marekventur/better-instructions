  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of a challenge that a person with a disability may face is the lack of accessibility in the community. Many people with disabilities face physical barriers that stop them from participating fully in everyday life, such as inaccessible buildings and transportation, or lack of assistive technology. This can lead to feelings of isolation, frustration, and depression, which can make it difficult to maintain employment and engage in social activities.",
