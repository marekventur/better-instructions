  "input": "According to UNICEF, over the last decade, the number of out-of-school children of primary school age has decreased from 106 million to 70 million. However, the progress has been uneven, in part due to major population growth in sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, the gap between the number of children who finish primary school and those who do not is widening.",
  "output": "Unicef reported that the number of out-of-school children aged approximately 6-11 has decreased from 106 million to 70 million over the past decade, but the progress is inconsistent and population growth in some regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, is making the gap between educated and uneducated kids larger.",
