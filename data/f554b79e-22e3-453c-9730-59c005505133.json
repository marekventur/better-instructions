  "output": "The Dewey Decimal System is a library classification system that is commonly used around the world. It is composed of two main components: the main classes and the subdivisions. The main classes consist of general topics that define the broad categories of the system, such as philosophy, poetry, history, and mathematics. Subdivisions are the specific topics within each main class that are further defined by a number. For example, in Philosophy the subclasses range from 10 (Metaphysics) to 199 (phenomenology).",
