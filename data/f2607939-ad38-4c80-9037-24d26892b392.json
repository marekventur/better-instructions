  "output": "Scientists study the oceans for many reasons. Oceans contain an immense amount of biodiversity, with thousands of species of plants and animals, many of which have yet to be discovered and documented. Additionally, oceans are a major source of food and can provide insight into the effects of climate change. Moreover, they are a vital component of Earth's water cycle, driving the evaporation and condensation of water vapor and helping to determine global weather patterns. Finally, the oceans serve as a source of many valuable resources and hold the potential for a vast array of medical, technological, and economic advances.",
