  "instruction": "Give an example of how science can explain a certain phenomenon.",
  "input": "Rising sea levels",
  "output": "The Science explains that rising sea levels are caused by thermal expansion, melting glaciers, and polar ice melt. As temperatures rise and more ice melts, the ocean absorbs more water, causing the sea to expand. Moreover, melting glaciers and polar ice caps increase the volume of water that water can absorb and increase sea levels further. These natural changes are further accelerated by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and land-use changes, thus exacerbating the rate at which sea levels are rising.",
