  "input": "",
  "output": "Some of the techniques that can be used to detect outliers in a dataset include using the interquartile range, using box-and-whisker plots, and using Z-scores. Additionally, approaches based on clustering, such as k-means and DBSCAN, can be used to find outliers by detecting points which are significantly different from the other points in the dataset.",
