  "output": "Once upon a time there was a robot named JEDI who found itself stranded on a remote island. Its programming was too basic to help it escape, and all it could do was explore the island and the sea around it. During its explorations, JEDI found the remains of a shipwreck and worked tirelessly to repair it, so that he could sail off the island. After a long and arduous journey, JEDI was able to cross the sea and make its way back home to its creator.",
