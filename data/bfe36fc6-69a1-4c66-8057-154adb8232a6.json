  "output": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from experience without explicit programming. It uses algorithms to identify patterns in data, build models from these patterns, and make predictions and decisions based on the models. These algorithms allow computers to improve with experience, without receiving direct guidance or programming.",
