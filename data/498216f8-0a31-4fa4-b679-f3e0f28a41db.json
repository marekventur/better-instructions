  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a plant cell and an animal cell is that the former contains a cell wall composed of cellulose and the latter does not. Plant cells also lack lysosomes and centrioles, which are found in animal cells. Plant cells also store energy in the form of starch, while animal cells store energy as glycogen. Plant cells also have chloroplasts, which are used for photosynthesis, whereas animal cells do not.",
