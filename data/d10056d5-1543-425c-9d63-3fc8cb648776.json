  "instruction": "Analyze the following passage to find any counter-arguments.",
  "input": "Education is the key to success. People who have a good education have more job opportunities, higher salaries, and are better equipped to handle any issue that life throws at them.",
  "output": "This passage could be countered by arguing that there are people who have achieved success without a good education. For instance, some entrepreneurs have become successful without having a college degree, relying instead on their determination, hard work and creativity. Additionally, a good education does not guarantee success; other factors such as having a strong support system and a positive attitude also play an important role.",
