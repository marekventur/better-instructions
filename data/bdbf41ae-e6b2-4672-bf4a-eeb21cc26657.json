  "output": "When responding to a customer with a complaint, the most important thing is to ensure that the customer feels heard and that their concerns are taken seriously. Acknowledge their feelings, apologize for the issue, and let them know what action you will take to remedy the situation. Whenever possible, offer a solution that addresses their complaints. Be sure to maintain a calm, professional demeanour, as customers appreciate being treated with respect. Be sure to follow up with the customer afterwards to ensure that their expectations have been met.",
