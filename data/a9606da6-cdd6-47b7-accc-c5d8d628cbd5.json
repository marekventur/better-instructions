  "input": "",
  "output": "The sky looks blue on a sunny day because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when sunlight is scattered off of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, resulting in short blue wavelengths being scattered more than the longer red, yellow, and orange ones. This causes the sky to appear blue, and as the sun moves across the sky the blue is well lit, providing a bright blue sky.",
