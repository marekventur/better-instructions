  "input": "",
  "output": "Setting up a conference call requires setting up a conference line for multiple people to dial in to, creating a call agenda, choosing a time, and setting up any other necessary audio-visual components. First, you will need to choose a conference line provider that best meets your needs and provide the necessary access codes so that people can dial in and join the call. Second, you'll need to create a call agenda that outlines the purpose of the conference call, the topics and action items to be discussed, and any other pertinent information. Finally, you'll need to choose a time and date that works for all participants and ensure that everyone has confirmed their availability.",
