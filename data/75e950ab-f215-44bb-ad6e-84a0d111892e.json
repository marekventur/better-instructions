  "output": "Nina nervously made her way into the courtyard of her new school, her heart pounding in her chest as she caught sight of the other students. It was the first day of 10th grade and she had no idea what to expect. Trying her best to push away her nerves, she forced herself to take a deep breath and scan the crowd for familiar faces.\n\nAs she looked around, she noticed that almost everyone was already in groups, discussing books and music with animated expressions on their faces. Everyone seemed to have someone to talk to, but Nina felt more and more isolated as the minutes passed. She had no idea how she was supposed to make friends.\n\nSuddenly, she felt a tap on her shoulder. When she turned around, she saw a smiling girl about her age with wild curls, a rainbow backpack and hands full of books. \n\n\"Hey, I'm Scarlet and I couldn't help but notice that you look a bit lost. Do you want to go grab lunch together?\"\n\nNina smiled hesitantly and accepted Scarlet's offer. Little did she know, but this first meeting would ignite a beautiful friendship that would stay with her throughout high school and beyond.",
