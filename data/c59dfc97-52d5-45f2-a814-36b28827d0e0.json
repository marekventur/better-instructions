  "instruction": "List three points of evidence to suggest that the cause of global warming is human activity.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "1. One of the key points of evidence is that CO2 levels have increased significantly since the 1700s and have remained constant since the industrial revolution. This points to human activity as a key cause of global warming.\n2. Also, research has found that the majority of warming occurred over land and in the Arctic, where human activity is most dominant.\n3. Furthermore, cooler areas of the world are now warming faster than previously warmer areas, indicating that humans are responsible for warming the atmosphere faster than natural processes alone.",
