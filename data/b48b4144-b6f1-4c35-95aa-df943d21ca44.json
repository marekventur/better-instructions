  "instruction": "Based on the article, explain the importance of machine learning in healthcare.",
  "input": "Article:\n\nMachine learning is increasingly being used to develop techniques and processes that are redefining the entire healthcare industry.",
  "output": "The use of machine learning has become essential in healthcare due to its ability to quickly process large amounts of data, draw meaningful insights, and identify trends or patterns in data that may be difficult to notice by humans. With machine learning, healthcare professionals are now able to make better, more informed decisions with fewer errors. Machine learning has enabled greater accuracy in diagnosis and data analysis, resulting in better outcomes for patients. Additionally, machine learning can be used to reduce operational costs, improve operational efficiency and scale services to meet demands.",
