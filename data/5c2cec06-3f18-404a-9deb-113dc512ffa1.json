One day, while exploring a forgotten corner of the town, she stumbled upon Henry -- a robot that looked like it belonged to another era. She decided to take him with her, and from that day on, the two of them had the best of adventures. They explored old ruins, discovered hidden caves, and made lots of friends along the way. Most importantly, Sarah had the friendship she had always wanted.",
