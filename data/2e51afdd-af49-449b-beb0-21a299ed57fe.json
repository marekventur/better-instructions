  "instruction": "Discuss the implications of the problems the main character faces in the given story.",
  "input": "The main character in the story is a young artist trying to break into the art world. She faces many problems including lack of financial support, lack of resources, and limited connections.",
  "output": "The lack of financial support, resources and connections for the main character in the story implies that there are existing barriers to success in the art world. Without these resources, she is unable to compete on an even playing field with artists who have the advantage of having these resources. This can lead to inequality and lead to those with fewer resources being overlooked or ignored. Additionally, it might also lead to a lack of creativity and innovation in the art world, as those who have more resources are able to continue using well-worn strategies. This could limit the potential new ideas and styles that can come out of the art world.",
