  "output": "By 2100, we may see advances in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, genetic engineering, and 3D printing. We can also expect to see the development of faster and more efficient forms of transportation, as well as autonomous vehicles and advanced energy sources. Technology for space exploration may be vastly improved, and we will likely see improvements in biotechnology, medicine and healthcare, agriculture, and climate change initiatives. We may also experience new forms of communication and leisure, such as virtual and augmented reality, holograms, and artificial environments.",
