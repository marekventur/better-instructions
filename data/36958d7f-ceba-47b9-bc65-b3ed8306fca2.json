  "output": "The United States Constitution was ratified in 1787, while the French Constitution of 1958 updated the post-World War II constitution. The US Constitution outlines the structure of government and spells out the enumerated and implied powers of the three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. It also includes a Bill of Rights which guarantees many civil liberties. In contrast, the French Constitution consolidated the existing republics, creating the Fifth Republic. It outlines the structure of government, including a strong executive presidency, along with rights and freedoms like the right to work, the right to expression, and the right to education. It is also strongly influenced by the European Convention on Human Rights.",
