  "output": "This research paper looks at the potential of image processing techniques for automatic detection of landslides in Digitized Image Maps (DIM). Using convolutional neural networks, two datasets of DIM images from different geographical areas are used to classify pre and post slide images. The results show that the proposed method provides promising results and outperforms other comparative techniques.",
