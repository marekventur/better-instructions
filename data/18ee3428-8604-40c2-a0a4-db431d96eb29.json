  "output": "Sand has a grainy texture. It feels rough and grainy to the touch. Depending on the type of sand, the grains can vary in size from very fine particles to larger pieces. The sand's texture is also dependent on the type of material the sand is made of, such as crushed rocks or sea shells. When wet, the sand becomes even more rough and clumpy to the touch. Sand also has a gritty feeling that is distinct to the touch.",
