  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to improve recycling practices is to implement deposit refund programs. This involves consumers paying a refundable deposit when purchasing a product, which they can later receive back when they return the item to a recycling center. This incentivizes people to recycle since they have a financial incentive to do so. This type of program has been proven to be effective in increasing recycling rates. Additionally, businesses should be encouraged to use reusable materials instead of disposable ones to reduce waste.",
