  "instruction": "Come up with an argument in favor of this proposal",
  "input": "Proposal: Stores should not offer plastic bags as part of their packaging.",
  "output": "We should do away with plastic bags as part of store packaging since they are a major source of ocean pollution. Plastic bags can take up to 500 years to breakdown, and they are one of the most common forms of marine debris. Plastic bags are also a danger to marine life, as animals often mistake the thin material for food and can be poisoned if they consume it. Furthermore, plastic bags can damage ecosystems by smothering and suffocating plants and animals.",
