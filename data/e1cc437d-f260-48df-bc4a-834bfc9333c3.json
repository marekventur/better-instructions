  "output": "The current political situation in Thailand is highly unstable. The Prime Minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, was re-elected after the 2014 coup. His government has been met with staunch opposition from the youth and pro-democracy activists who are calling for greater transparency and accountability. It remains to be seen whether the government will make any further efforts to move the country towards a democracy. The recent anti-government protests have been met with violent suppression from the police, leading to dozens of injuries and arrests. There has been a demand for international intervention to move Thailand towards a democratic system.",
