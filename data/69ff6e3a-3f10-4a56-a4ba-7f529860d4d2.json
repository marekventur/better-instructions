  "output": "Investing in stocks provides an opportunity to build wealth over time and diversify your overall portfolio. Stocks offer higher returns than other investments such as bonds, saving accounts, and CDs. Stocks also offer great liquidity, meaning that you can easily access your funds when needed. Investing in stocks also gives you access to the unique features of individual companies, such as dividends and potential appreciation of the stock price. There are risks associated with investing in stocks, but the rewards can be significant.",
