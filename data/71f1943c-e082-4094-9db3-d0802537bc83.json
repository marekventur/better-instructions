  "instruction": "Identify a common issue in your community and then propose a solution.",
  "input": "The community is Brighton, MI.",
  "output": "One common issue in Brighton, MI is access to fresh, healthy food. Many people in the area rely on convenience stores for their food, which can lead to unhealthy diets. To address this issue, I would propose a community initiative to provide grants that subsidize the development of more grocery stores in the area. The initiative would also provide resources to educate the community on healthy eating and meal planning. This could help to alleviate the food insecurity issue while also encouraging healthier lifestyles.",
