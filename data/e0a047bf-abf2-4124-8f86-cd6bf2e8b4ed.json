  "output": "The process of purifying water typically follows a series of steps to ensure that it is safe for human consumption or use. Generally it involves screening to remove particulate matter, sedimentation and flocculation to settle out suspended solids, disinfection to kill any harmful organisms, filtration to remove chemically suspended particles, and aeration to remove excessive amounts of carbon dioxide. Lastly, pH adjustment may be necessary to make water more suitable for human consumption.",
