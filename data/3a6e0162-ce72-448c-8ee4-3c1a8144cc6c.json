  "output": "Last year, I used technology to help my elderly neighbor set up her email account. She had recently moved in and wanted to be able to keep in touch with her extended family and friends through email. I patiently walked her through the steps of setting up an account, setting up her contacts, and sending an email. I was glad to be able to help her gain more independence and stay connected to her loved ones.",
