  "input": "",
  "output": "Hebb's Rule is an important concept in artificial neural networks because it is the foundation of learning in the brain. It states that neurons that fire together wire together, which means that when two neurons frequently fire simultaneously, the connection between them is strengthened. This rule is an important concept for neural networks because it is used to adjust the weights of the synapses between neurons in order to strengthen (or weaken) the connection and improve the performance of the network. The rule is also used for feature detection, i.e. recognizing patterns or features in the training data set.",
