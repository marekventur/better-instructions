  "input": "",
  "output": "Albert Einstein's theory of relativity states that time and space are variables and not constants. A scenario in which this theory might be valid is when observing objects that travel at relativistic speeds, near the speed of light. In this case, time and space are distorted, and the theory of relativity can be used to explain the observations.",
