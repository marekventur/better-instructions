  "instruction": "Edit a rough draft of a paper on solar system astronomy.",
  "input": "The first recorded observation of the Solar System was in prehistoric times. Astronomers were able to observe the planets and stars in the solar system. They found that the planets were different and that they moved in a way that followed patterns. This helped them to form theories and to map out the Solar System.",
  "output": "The earliest documented observations of the Solar System date back to prehistoric times, with astronomers observing the celestial bodies and patterns of their movements. This resulted in the formation of theories and the eventual mapping of the Solar System. Different features of the planets such as their appearance and orbits lent evidence to the realization that there was something unique about them. By studying the planets and their movements, astronomers eventually began to get a better understanding of our Solar System.",
