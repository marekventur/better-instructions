  "instruction": "Describe how an AC system works.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An AC system essentially works by compressing a gas that is typically a refrigerant, to absorb heat from indoors. The compressed refrigerant is then expanded to release its heat outdoors. This creates a cooling effect as the heat is transferred from inside to outside. The refrigerant is then sent back to be cooled and re-compressed, repeating the cycle.",
