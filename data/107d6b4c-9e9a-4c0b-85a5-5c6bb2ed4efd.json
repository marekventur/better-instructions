  "input": "",
  "output": "Building an AI-controlled healthcare system could bring both positive and negative ethics implications. On the positive side, AI-controlled healthcare systems could allow better access to healthcare and enable doctors to access data more quickly. On the negative side, AI-controlled healthcare systems can lead to the potential for healthcare data to be used inappropriately and AI algorithms to misdiagnose cases and make mistakes. There is also the potential that AI-controlled systems may lead to an increased use of automated procedures which could lead to fewer jobs in the healthcare industry. The ethical implications of this system will have to be taken into account to ensure that any AI-controlled healthcare system is as fair and safe as possible.",
