  "input": "The film Parasite",
  "output": "The film Parasite is an astonishingly honest and timely exploration of economic inequality and societal class division. Through its masterful use of cinematography and well-crafted characters, it provides an enthralling and poignant insight into how wealth can divide us and how it might bring us together. It is a potent reminder that we can never forget the inequalities around us, nor take for granted the privileges we have. This deep exploration of class division and moral complexities make Parasite a must-see and worthy inclusion in any top 10 list.",
