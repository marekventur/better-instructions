  "input": "",
  "output": "Blockchain technology offers several advantages for digital transactions. The technology uniquely provides an unhackable and secure record system, protecting transacted data from any unauthorized changes. Moreover, decentralized ledger records can reduce the settlement time, ensuring transactions are completed in seconds through distributed consensus mechanisms. Furthermore, smart contracts make blockchain transactions convenient and automated, since they allow digital agreements to be securely implemented without concern of manipulation. Finally, blockchain technology has the potential to reduce transaction costs and fees, since third parties such as banking institutions are no longer needed for the validation and settlement of payments.",
