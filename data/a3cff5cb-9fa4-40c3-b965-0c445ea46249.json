  "output": "A parallel universe is a hypothetical concept of a separate reality which could be similar or completely different from our own. It is a concept that is often explored in science fiction, where alternative stories, events, and outcomes are explored. The existence of a parallel universe is still a matter of debate, but if it exists, it could be a fascinating and potentially parallel version of our own universe.",
