  "instruction": "Describe two effects of land-use change on atmospheric chemistry.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One effect of land-use change on atmospheric chemistry is increased emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. For example, when forests are cleared for urban or agricultural uses, this increases the amount of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere. Additionally, land-use change can also result in the release of other pollutants from activities such as burning biomass or industrial activities. \n\nAnother effect of land-use change is decreased photosynthesis. This can lead to decreased uptake of atmospheric pollutants such as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. As a result, these pollutants will remain in the atmosphere, thus further increasing global temperatures. Land-use change can also affect natural sinks of pollutants, such as wetlands and forests, further leading to an increase in atmospheric pollutants.",
