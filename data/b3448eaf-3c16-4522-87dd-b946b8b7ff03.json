  "input": "Nanotechnology",
  "output": "One of the biggest cons of nanotechnology is the risk of pollution. Because nanomaterials are so small, it can be hard to know if these materials are released into the environment and how they might impact the environment. There is also potential for nanoparticles from consumer products to enter the food chain and potentially be consumed by humans. This poses a potential risk to human health because the safety of exposure to nanomaterials is not fully understood.",
