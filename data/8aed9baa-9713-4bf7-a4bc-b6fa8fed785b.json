  "output": "A moral dilemma is a situation in which there are two actions, both of which have an ethical consequence. For example, whether to lie in order to protect a loved one or to tell the truth, even at the risk of their consequences. In this case, a person should consider the consequence of their decision and think about the effects it will have on others. They should weigh the risks and benefits of both scenarios and consider the moral implications of their choice before making the best decision.",
