  "output": "Mitosis is the process of cell division that occurs in eukaryotic organisms. The process produces two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. It begins with the duplication of the chromosome, which occurs during interphase. During the prophase stage of mitosis, the chromosomes and the mitotic spindle condense and the nuclear membrane disintegrates. During metaphase, the chromosomes align on the metaphase plate. During anaphase, the chromosomes are pulled towards the poles of the cell, opposite to the center, and the sister chromatids are separated. Finally, during telophase, the nuclear membrane reforms and the chromosomes decondense. This completes the process of mitosis and the cell is divided into two daughter cells.",
