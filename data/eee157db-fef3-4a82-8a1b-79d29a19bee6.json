  "input": "",
  "output": "Two ways to keep your computer secure are using antivirus and anti-malware software and enabling two-factor authentication for your accounts. Antivirus and anti-malware software protect your computer from malicious software and malware that can steal your personal data. Two-factor authentication requires two levels of authentication, like a password plus a verification code sent to your phone, to gain access to an account, making it much harder for someone to gain unauthorized access.",
