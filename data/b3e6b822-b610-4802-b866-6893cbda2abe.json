  "input": "",
  "output": "GMO foods, which are plants and animals that have been modified through gene-editing techniques to produce desired traits, have caused significant debate among scientists as to their possible effects on health, the environment, and the global food supply. While some argue that they offer nutritional benefits and increased crop yields, others warn of possible health risks and environmental damage due to the potential of the modified genes to spread to non-GMO crops. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that GMO foods have had a major impact on the way food is produced and consumed around the world.",
