  "instruction": "Create a web crawler to scrape data from the website.",
  "input": "Website URL: https://www.example.com/",
  "output": "The web crawler should be able to scrape data from the website by visiting each page and extracting the desired information. It should also be able to follow links to other pages and run in a systematic, structured way. Furthermore, the crawler should be able to detect and handle errors, such as when a page doesn't load properly or there is a timeout.  Finally, the crawler should be able to store the data obtained in a structured format, such as a CSV or a database.",
