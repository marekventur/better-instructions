  "input": "",
  "output": "To calculate the tip on a $42 restaurant bill, you first need to decide on the percentage of tip you would like to give. The most common tipping percentage is between 15-20%, so you would typically begin by multiplying the total bill by 0.15 or 0.2 to get the dollar amount of your tip. For example, if you wanted to leave a 20% tip, you would multiply 42 by 0.2 to get 8.40, so your total bill would be $50.40.",
