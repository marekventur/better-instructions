  "input": "",
  "output": "Bob, Jack, Sarah and Angela were once good friends, but something had caused them to drift apart. Bob had said something hurtful to Jack which had angered Sarah, and Jack was too embarrassed to apologize. Sarah, in turn, had lashed out at Angela in frustration, who was resentful and refused to forgive her. As the situation deteriorated, the four of them stopped speaking to each other.",
