  "instruction": "Explain why would it be beneficial to use an existing classification model rather than building a new one.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "By using an existing model, there is potential to save time, resources and cost, since the model has already been developed and trained. Transfer learning can also be used to quickly customize an existing model to the specific classification needs of a new domain or dataset. Additionally, existing models offer a measure of validation, as they have already been tested on data and have successfully completed a task in a certain domain. This offers a certain degree of certainty that the model will be able to achieve the desired outcome. Furthermore, some existing models are open-source and could be accessed at no cost. Lastly, if the classification model is used for a difficult task and is developed by experts, there is a higher likelihood that the model will outperform the accuracy of a newly created model.",
