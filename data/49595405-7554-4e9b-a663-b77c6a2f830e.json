  "instruction": "Create a program that evaluates student performance.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The program should accept student data in the form of a set of grades, test scores, and other performance metrics for a given semester. It should then calculate a final grade for the student and a grade point average for the semester. The program should also generate a report card which shows grades for each class and the cumulative grade point average. Finally, the report card should generate a message to the student outlining their performance and providing feedback.",
