  "input": "5, 8, 7, 10, 8, 6, 9",
  "output": "To create a frequency distribution table for the given list of numbers, first arrange the values in ascending order. The list of numbers is then divided into ranges for example 0-4, 5-9, 10-14. The frequencies for each range is calculated by counting the number of data points in each range. Finally, each range and the corresponding frequency is recorded in a table. In this case, the frequency distribution table is 0-4: 0, 5-9: 5, 10-14: 1.",
