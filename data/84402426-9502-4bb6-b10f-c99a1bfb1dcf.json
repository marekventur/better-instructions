  "input": "City commuters",
  "output": "A new product for city commuters could be an intelligent, solar-powered electric scooter. It would be able to travel up to 25 miles on a single charge and have a range of speeds, making it ideal for daily commutes. It would have a built-in GPS system, Bluetooth connectivity, and a phone-charging port. The scooter could be easily folded and locked, making it a convenient choice for busy commuters.",
