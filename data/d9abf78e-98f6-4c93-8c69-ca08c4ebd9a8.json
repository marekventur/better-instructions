  "input": "",
  "output": "A first-order function is a function that accepts only one argument and returns only one value. A higher-order function is a function that accepts one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as a result. Higher order functions can be used to achieve more complex operations, such as manipulating the elements of a list or dictionary, or creating custom functions.",
