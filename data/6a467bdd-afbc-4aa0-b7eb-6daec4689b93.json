  "output": "The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. This law implies that energy is continuously being dissipated, which can cause a decrease of available energy that can be used to do work. In other words, any closed system is eventually going to reach thermodynamic equilibrium where processes will stop and no more work can be done. This means that, eventually, all usable energy within a system will be converted into heat.",
