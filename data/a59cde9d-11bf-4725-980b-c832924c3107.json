  "output": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to better process and interpret natural languages like English or Spanish. NLP models are used to build applications that can understand and respond to human language, such as chatbots or voice recognition systems. The purpose of NLP models is to enable computers to understand and interact with humans in their own language, enabling more efficient and meaningful communication. The benefits of using NLP models are improved accuracy, faster response times, cost efficiency, and improved customer experience.",
