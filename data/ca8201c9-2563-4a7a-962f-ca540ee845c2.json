  "input": "",
  "output": "The safety of employees should be the primary factor in determining if a work environment is suitable. The safety of employees should be considered before any other factors, such as profits and deadlines. A safe work environment reduces the risk of accidents and injuries and can also improve morale and productivity. Furthermore, employers are legally obligated to provide a safe workplace and are required by law to take precautions to protect workers. The safety of workers should therefore be a priority for employers and considered when evaluating workplace suitability.",
