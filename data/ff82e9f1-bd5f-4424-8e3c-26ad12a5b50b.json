  "input": "",
  "output": "The saying \"it's like herding cats\" is said to refer to a person's futile attempts to organize or control something or someone that is impossible to direct or control. The phrase comes from an old Irish proverb, which states: \"You cannot herd cats, for they do not go by the same footsteps\". The concept is often used to describe an effort or task that is impossible or difficult to complete.",
