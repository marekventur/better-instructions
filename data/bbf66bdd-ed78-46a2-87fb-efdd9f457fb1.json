  "output": "A Chutes and Ladders board game board consists of a large square grid with 100 numbered squares. The board also has several ladders and chutes positioned around it. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach the finish square at number 100. During the game, players take turns rolling a die and moving along the board the number of squares represented by the die roll. If the player lands on a ladder, the player moves up the ladder to a higher numbered square. If the player lands on a chute, the player moves down the chute to a lower numbered square. The game ends when a player reaches the finish square.",
