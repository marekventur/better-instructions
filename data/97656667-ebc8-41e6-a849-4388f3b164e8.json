Nearby, there was a beach lined with tall palm trees and in the distance, a lighthouse stood tall, quietly keeping watch over the sea. The scene was so peaceful that it almost seemed like time had come to a standstill. Suddenly, a group of dolphins leapt out of the water, joyfully playing in the waves as if to remind everyone present of the miracle of life.",
