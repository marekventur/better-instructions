  "input": "",
  "output": "I am proposing a business opportunity that would provide an innovative solution to promote environmental sustainability. The business would be a subscription-based service that would enable households to purchase and receive sustainable products, such as renewable energy sources and sustainable food products, directly at their door step.  These products would be sourced from local suppliers and delivered in eco-friendly packaging. Furthermore, the business would offer customers educational materials and resources that would empower them to make better choices and reduce their environmental impact.",
