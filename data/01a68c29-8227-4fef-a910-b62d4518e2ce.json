  "instruction": "Create an algorithm to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "My algorithm for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions involves checking for suspicious activity. The algorithm flags transactions that are outside of the cardholder\u2019s normal spending patterns, are made from unusual locations or from a high-risk country, or involve large sums of money. The algorithm also flags transactions that involve large numbers of refunds and/or reversals and transactions that involve multiple cards from the same account. Finally, the algorithm checks for transactions that involve duplicate transactions. All flagged transactions will be flagged for manual review.",
