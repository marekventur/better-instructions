  "output": "Good evening everyone. We are all here tonight to recognize the importance of taking care of the environment. We are all so fortunate to live on this beautiful planet and yet, many of us fail to recognize and preserve its beauty. Too often, we take for granted the clean air we breathe, the clean water we drink, and the abundant wildlife that populate our landscapes. It is our moral responsibility to take care of this planet and to ensure that our future generations can enjoy it just as much as we do. Our actions today will determine the future of our planet, so let us all work together to make it a better place for everyone. Let us be more conscious of our choices and preserve our planet for the greater good.",
