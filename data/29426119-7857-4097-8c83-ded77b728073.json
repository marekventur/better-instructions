  "output": "A loss function measures the performance of a machine learning model, typically by calculating the difference between the model\u2019s predictions and the true values. The loss function is used to determine the model\u2019s accuracy, and to train the model by minimizing the difference between the model\u2019s predictions and the true values.",
