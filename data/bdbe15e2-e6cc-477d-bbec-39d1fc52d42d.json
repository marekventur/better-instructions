  "output": "The strategy would involve multiple methods of collecting customer feedback. Depending on the scope of the project, surveys or interviews can be conducted to gain qualitative insight on customer satisfaction. Additionally, data can be collected from customer support systems, website analytics, transaction records, customer service interactions, customer feedback forums, customer move-out reports, and customer loyalty programs, providing a more comprehensive picture of customer satisfaction. The collected data should then be analyzed and monitored over time to track customer satisfaction trends and identify areas for improvement.",
