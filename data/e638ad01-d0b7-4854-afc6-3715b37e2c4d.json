  "input": "Marie Curie",
  "output": "Marie Curie was a Polish-born scientist whose groundbreaking research in radiation and radioactivity led to her becoming the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only woman to win the award in two different fields: physics and chemistry. Born to a teacher and a principal, Marie showed an early interest in mathematics and physics and would go on to attend one of the few educational institutions in Europe at the time that allowed for women. Despite these barriers and the gender discrimination she faced in academia, Marie was able to make important contributions to the scientific fields and invent new techniques in radioactivity that earned her two Nobel Prizes. Marie\u2019s last years were spent advocating for women in science and also research in radiology. She passed away in 1934 due to aplastic anemia, which she is believed to have contracted from radiation she was exposed to in her research. Her legacy continues to live on, inspiring generations of scientists and women, who honor her courage, determination and groundbreaking discoveries.",
