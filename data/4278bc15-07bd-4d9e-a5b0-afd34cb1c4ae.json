  "output": "Biodiversity, the web of life\nFrom tiniest plants to mightiest beasts\nAll interconnected, the tapestry frays\nWhen its threads are disturbed, woe will increase\n\nLife depends on Earth's immense variety\nBalance in nature must be kept in check\nAll creatures and air, water, soil sustain us\nWithout them, our future will surely wreak\n\nAt first, the harms may be slight or unseen\nBut soon it will be drastic, and life upheaved\nOur ignorance or indifference of today\nWill destroy our tomorrows if not relieved\n\nIn safeguarding our world, come together now\nFor biodiversity is the guardian of life\nIts importance can never be underestimated\nIt's the only hope we have to survive.",
