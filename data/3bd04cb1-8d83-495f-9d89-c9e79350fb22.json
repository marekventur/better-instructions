  "input": "",
  "output": "A typical workday for a computer programmer usually starts with reviewing and responding to emails. Then, they might have a meeting with their team to discuss the progress of their project and what tasks should be completed. After that, they would most likely spend the majority of their workday coding, debugging, and troubleshooting. This may require them to consult additional resources such as videos and blogs to assist with their coding efforts. During lunch breaks, they may have the chance to catch up with other developers, exchange ideas and discuss new technologies in their field. At the end of the day, the programmer may work on writing technical documentation or review the code of their colleagues.",
