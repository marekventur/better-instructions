  "output": "Miles Davis's track \"So What\" is an influential jazz composition that features an up-tempo arrangement. The melody is based around blues, with a smooth and improvisational tone. The song is largely marked by its delicate and unpredictable phrasing, with a sophisticated harmonic structure built around diminished and augmented chords. The instrumentation is characterized by a haunting trumpet lead, supported by a rhythm section of piano, double bass, and drums.",
