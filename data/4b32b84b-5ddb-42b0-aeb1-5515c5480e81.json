  "input": "",
  "output": "There is no known single algorithm for solving a Rubik's Cube in the fewest moves possible, however there are various algorithms that are used to simplify the task. These algorithms are formed of combinatorics, theories and heuristics, tree search and pattern databases, and apply to all cube sizes. One example algorithm is the Beginner\u2019s Method, which involves solving a Rubik\u2019s Cube through a series of algorithms that determine which face should be manipulated at each turn, ultimately resulting in a completed cube.",
