  "input": "",
  "output": "An augmented reality application is an interactive system that uses a real-world environment and combines it with virtual images, videos and sounds. It uses virtual objects, such as 3D models, text and audio, to improve the user's experience in the real-world. Augmented reality typically uses cameras, sensors, and technologies such as machine learning, robotic process automation, and natural language processing to detect objects in the real-world and deliver an interactive virtual experience. By capturing the user's environment, the application can generate a simulated environment to enable real-time interactions with the user. The system then responds to the user's input and updates the content accordingly, creating a truly immersive and interactive experience.",
