  "output": "Cleaning a wooden cutting board is simple, but it should be done properly to ensure that it remains safe to use. First, use a gentle dish soap and warm water to scrub away food particles and residue. Then, rinse the cutting board with warm water and dry it thoroughly with a clean cloth. If necessary, use a gentle scrubbing brush to remove any stubborn particles. To help prevent delaminating, periodically rub the cutting board with mineral oil.",
