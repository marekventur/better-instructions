  "output": "The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is a network of membranes with functions in both protein synthesis and lipid metabolism. It is involved in the folding and modification of proteins and plays a role in the assembly of membrane proteins. It is also responsible for lipid metabolism, including the formation of lipids and their transport throughout the cell. It also serves as a storage organelle for calcium ions.",
