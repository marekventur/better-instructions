  "input": "",
  "output": "A system for managing payroll should include features such as real-time payroll calculation, time tracking, and employee access to their own account information. The system should also provide security features to ensure the accuracy of employee payroll information and to prevent unauthorized access. The system should be flexible and scalable enough to accommodate different payroll continents, rules and regulations. It should also include functionality for tracking hours worked and apply payroll deductions as necessary. Furthermore, the system should be able to easily generate various reports related to pay period earnings, deductions, bonus payments and taxes.",
