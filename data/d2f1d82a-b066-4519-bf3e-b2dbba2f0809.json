  "input": "",
  "output": "My suggestion is to create a plan according to your goals. Set a specific goal with a timeline, make sure it's realistic. You should also set smaller, measurable goals to mark your progress. Identify activities that you can do in the local community or online and sign up for a program that suits your needs. Make sure to assess the programs before joining and ensure they are safe to use. Make sure to consult your doctor if you have any concerns.",
