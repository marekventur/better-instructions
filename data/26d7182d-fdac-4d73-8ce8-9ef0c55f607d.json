  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural disasters are caused by extreme changes in weather patterns as a result of climate change. They can also be caused by geological processes such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. Additionally, they can result from human activities, such as deforestation, destruction of wetlands, and diversion of rivers. Human-induced disasters such as those cause by oil spills may also lead to natural disasters.",
