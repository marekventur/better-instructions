  "input": "",
  "output": "AI can help doctors improve the healthcare system in many ways. For example, AI can be used to diagnose and treat complex medical cases, prevent disease outbreaks and diagnose emerging diseases far faster than traditional diagnostic methods. AI can also help doctors identify patients at risk of developing chronic diseases and provide preventative care. Furthermore, AI can be used to improve patient safety by automating administrative tasks and helping doctors keep track of patient data and medications. Finally, AI can help streamline the healthcare system by reducing unnecessary tests, speeding up appointment scheduling, and helping doctors come up with more accurate diagnoses.",
