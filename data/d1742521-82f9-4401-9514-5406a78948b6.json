  "input": "",
  "output": "Lions are found in a variety of habitats ranging from deserts to grasslands. They prefer areas with dense vegetation, woodlands and open woodland savannas with plenty of cover and nearby water sources. Lions will also inhabit mountain ranges and brushland as long as there is enough food and cover. Lions prefer to rest in shady areas during the heat of the day and will use rocky outcrops to survey their territories and hunt. Lions are also known to sometimes rest in trees and can survive in even the most water-scarce areas. Although they are typically solitary animals, they will form prides in areas where prey is plentiful. Lions have the most diverse habitat of all the big cats and are an important part of the many ecosystems around the world.",
