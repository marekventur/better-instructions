  "output": "The Bifidus is a magical creature that can split into two parts. It has the upper body of a human, with a pair of wings sprouting from its shoulder blades, and the lower body of a dragon. Its scales come in all shades of the rainbow and can mesmerize those who see it. The Bifidus can use its wings to fly long distances and always circles highland castles and other areas that people would consider sacred or off-limits. Its song is said to inspire courage and protect those who hear it. It is a symbol of strength and resilience.",
