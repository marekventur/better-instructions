  "instruction": "Create a list of four reasons why renewable energy is important for the environment.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, re-use natural energy systems to produce affordable electricity. This has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere, helping to slow global climate change. \n2. Renewable energy sources produce little to no pollution, greatly reducing the chances of air and water pollution. \n3. Renewable energy tends to be more efficient than non-renewable resources, making it a more cost-effective form of energy production.\n4. Renewable energy sources do not cause resource depletion, meaning they will be available for future generations to use. This helps ensure that there is a reliable and sustainable source of energy available in the future.",
