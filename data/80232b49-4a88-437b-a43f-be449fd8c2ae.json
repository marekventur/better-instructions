  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Switch to Energy-Efficient Appliances: Switching to energy-efficient appliances such as LED lights, washing machines, and heaters can reduce energy consumption significantly. \n\n2. Unplug Electronics When Not in Use: Many electronics, such as computers, can still use energy even when they are switched off. So unplugging them when they are not in use can help save energy. \n\n3. Utilize Natural Light: Taking advantage of natural light can reduce the need for artificial lighting, which can significantly reduce energy consumption.",
