Cut to her looking in the mirror and applying our make-up \u2013 it's perfect for every day wear, giving her an even, natural look that stands out from the crowd. We hear her voice, softly: \"With our make-up, I can feel confident, no matter where I am.\" Cut back to see her, radiant in her beauty, turn and walk back onto the street.",
