  "output": "A significant event in British history is the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 by King John. The Magna Carta was an agreement between the king and the barons of England. It declared that everyone should be subject to the same laws, including the king, and it contained some of the earliest ideas about civil rights and limited government. This document is seen as one of the foundations of the British legal system, helping to shape the world in which we now live.",
