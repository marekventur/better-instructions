  "input": "",
  "output": "This paper investigated the use of machine learning methods to identify rhetorical questions in documents. Specifically, two approaches were compared, a supervised method using an SVM classifier, and an unsupervised approach using a support vector algorithm and a clustering technique. The results found that both methods performed well in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art, with the supervised approach demonstrating the highest accuracy. The paper concluded that machine learning is an effective method to identifying rhetorical questions in documents and that further research should be conducted to refine the existing methods.",
