  "output": "To evaluate the effectiveness of a local charity program, it is important to consider three main factors: goals, implementation, and outcomes. Goals are the intended objectives of the program - what the program hopes to achieve. Implementation is the process by which the program is put into action - what strategies are used and how successful they are. And outcomes measure the ultimate results of the program - whether or not the goals were met and what impact the program had. With this evaluation, it is possible to determine if the charity program was successful and identify areas for improvement.",
