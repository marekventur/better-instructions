  "output": "Telehealth technology is an example of a technology that can be used to facilitate remote communication in a healthcare setting. Telehealth technology is a combination of communication software, equipment, and devices that enables healthcare practitioners to consult with, diagnose, and treat patients remotely. Telehealth technology can facilitate communication between providers and their patients, reducing the need for in-person visits, while still providing quality care. It can also be used to provide remote clinical support or supervision, as well as comprehensive telehealth services that include medical imaging, laboratory tests, patient education, and more.",
