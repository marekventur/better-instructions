  "instruction": "Compare and contrast songwriting with spoken word poetry.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Songwriting and spoken word poetry are two forms of creative expression that share many common characteristics. Both often employ literary devices, such as figurative language and imagery, to describe a particular feeling or emotion. However, they differ in terms of the range of techniques they can employ to craft a piece - while songwriting typically utilizes instruments, sung melodies and choruses, spoken word poetry relies more heavily on rhythm and variations in voice to create a desired soundscape. Additionally, songwriting often relies more on metaphors and lyrical devices, as speech is more difficult to interpret as rhyme and meter.",
