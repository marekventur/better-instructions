  "output": "Singing is a great way to boost physical, mental and emotional well-being. Singing can be an excellent form of exercise, as it increases lung capacity and improves circulation. Singing can also reduce stress and anxiety, as it requires focus, which helps to reduce excessive worrying. Furthermore, singing triggers the release of endorphins which create feelings of happiness, which helps with managing stress. Additionally, singing may even help to improve overall cognitive functioning by increasing levels of oxytocin, the hormone responsible for nurturing social connections.",
