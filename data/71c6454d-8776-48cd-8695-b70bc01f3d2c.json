  "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use light energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into organic compounds, such as glucose and oxygen. This process is essential for plants to create food energy and oxygen for other living things. Photosynthesis also helps to maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.",
