  "input": "",
  "output": "In calculus, a limit is a fundamental concept which describes the behavior of a function as its input approaches a certain point. Limits are used to establish the continuity and differentiability of functions, and to determine the rate of change of a function at a particular point. They are also a key part of calculus operations such as differentiation and integration.",
