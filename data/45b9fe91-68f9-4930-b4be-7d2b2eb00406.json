  "input": "Start-ups: Uber and Airbnb",
  "output": "Uber and Airbnb have both had a significant impact on the economy in recent years. Uber is a ride-hailing service that has revolutionized the transportation industry and opened new economic opportunities for many people. Airbnb is a platform that facilitates short-term rental services, allowing people to rent out their homes, apartments, or extra rooms at a lower cost than traditional hotels. Both companies have created new jobs, increased competition in the market, and changed consumer behaviors. In addition, these companies have also aided in the growth of other businesses such as delivery services, technology companies, and construction. Overall, Uber and Airbnb have transformed how people travel and how people stay in touch, and have had a large economic impact.",
