  "input": "",
  "output": "A suitable pricing strategy for selling a new type of computer hardware would involve the use of a value-based pricing model. This pricing model takes into account the features, quality, and customer-perceived value of the product, and sets a price that reflects the value of the hardware. Additionally, the pricing should be competitive so as to not price out potential customers, as well as offering discounts for volume purchases. Finally, an effective pricing strategy may involve a combination of price skimming, promotion, and bundling for maximum customer appeal.",
