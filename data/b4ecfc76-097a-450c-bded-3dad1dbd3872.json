  "output": "The stages of sleep can be broken down into four categories:\n1. NREM (Non-rapid eye movement) Stage One: This is the lightest stage of sleep, where the body relaxes and most muscle movements slow down.\n2. NREM Stage Two: In this stage, eye movements slow down and brain wave activity slows, signaling deeper sleep.\n3. NREM Stage Three: This is the deepest stage of sleep, and there is no eye movement. Brain wave activity slows to its lowest point, and muscle tension increases.\n4. REM (Rapid eye movement) Stage: This stage is when most dreaming occurs, and the eyes move quickly. Brain activity increases, while muscle activity decreases.",
