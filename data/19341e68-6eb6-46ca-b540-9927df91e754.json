  "input": "",
  "output": "Weather forecasting relies on a variety of techniques and tools, including both numerical and statistical methods. Numerical methods involve the use of complex weather models to simulate and predict weather on local and global scales. Statistical methods use historical data to infer future weather patterns and trends. Forecasters also use observational data, such as satellite imagery and surface observations, to supplement their forecasts. Finally, a variety of other tools, such as radar, lightning detectors, and lightning prediction models, are used to better observe and forecast severe weather.",
