  "output": "I would rate the food I had yesterday a 10 out of 10. It was incredibly delicious and incredibly fresh. The flavor was a perfect balance of savory and sweet, with a hint of smokiness. The texture of it was perfect, with a satisfying crunch. It was cooked perfectly, with everything being cooked just the right amount. Overall, it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time and I would highly recommend it.",
