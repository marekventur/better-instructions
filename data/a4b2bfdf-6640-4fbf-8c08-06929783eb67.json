  "input": "My x-ray shows a slight decrease in density from my last one",
  "output": "The cause of the decrease in density on your x-ray may be due to a weakening of the bones or to a decrease in calcium intake. Other potential causes could include thyroid problems which can cause an imbalance in calcium, vitamin D deficiency, autoimmune diseases, or medications that can interfere with the body's ability to absorb calcium. It's best to consult a doctor to determine the cause.",
