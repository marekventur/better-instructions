  "input": "",
  "output": "The symphony begins with a low rumble, mimicking the distant thunder. As the intensity builds, sounds of rolling thunder swell and crash. Soft notes of a light rain play in the background as the intensity of the storm grows. The symphony reaches its pinnacle with a loud and dramatic clap of thunder, then slowly descends back to a calm, steady rain as the storm moves on.",
