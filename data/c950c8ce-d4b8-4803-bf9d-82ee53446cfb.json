  "instruction": "Describe the chemical reaction that takes place when Sodium is placed in Water",
  "input": "",
  "output": "When Sodium is placed in water, a chemical reaction occurs and the Sodium reacts rapidly with the water molecules to form Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and Hydrogen Gas (H2). The reaction is exothermic, releasing energy as heat, light, and sound. This energy is usually accompanied by the formation of foam and bubbles of Hydrogen gas. This reaction is also known as the \u201cSodium-Water Reaction\u201d.",
