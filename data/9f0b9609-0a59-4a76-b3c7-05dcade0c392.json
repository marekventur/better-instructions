  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the similarities and differences between two topics.",
  "input": "Video Games and Board Games",
  "output": "Both video games and board games provide entertainment and the chance to learn and challenge yourself in various ways. In terms of similarities, both involve strategic decision-making, concentration and problem-solving skills. However, the two are vastly different in terms of cost; board games are generally cheaper than video games. Video games can involve more complex graphics and storylines, while board games tend to be simpler and focus more on player interaction. Overall, the biggest difference is that video games can be played alone while board games are designed for multiple players.",
