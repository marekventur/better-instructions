  "input": "",
  "output": "Scaling is the process of changing the scale of data used in machine learning algorithms. This can involve changing the range of the data values by using normalization, reducing variance by using standardization, or using logarithmic scaling to bring order of magnitude differences in the data points closer together. Scaling can help machine learning algorithms perform more accurately and efficiently by providing a more uniform dataset.",
