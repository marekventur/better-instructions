  "input": "",
  "output": "Cats and dogs have different dietary needs. Cats require a high protein diet and should not eat grains, while dogs can better tolerate a more varied diet and can benefit from grains. Cats require taurine, an amino acid that is absent from grain-based diets, while dogs can make their own. Cats also require more water, so access to fresh water should always be provided.",
