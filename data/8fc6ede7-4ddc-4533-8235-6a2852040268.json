  "output": "Two ways to reduce car emissions include using fuel-efficient cars and using alternative fuels. Fuel-efficient cars help reduce emissions by consuming less fuel and reducing the amount of tailpipe emissions. Alternative fuels can help reduce emissions by offering a cleaner form of energy than traditional fuels like gasoline. Examples of alternative fuels include ethanol and biodiesel.",
