  "input": "",
  "output": "The steps for teaching a robot to sort coins are as follows:\n1. Design a dataset of coins with different sizes, shapes, and weights to use for training the robot. \n2. Develop a feature-extraction algorithm to detect properties of each coin, such as size and shape.\n3. Develop a classification algorithm to differentiate between types of coins, such as penny, nickel, dime, and quarter.\n4. Train the robot using supervised machine learning and the dataset of coins.\n5. Test the robot\u2019s accuracy and refine the algorithm if necessary.\n6. Program the robot with the final algorithm for sorting coins.",
