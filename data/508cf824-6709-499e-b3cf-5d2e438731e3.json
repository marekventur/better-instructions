  "input": "Design guide for tech product involving AI & robotics with a cartoon theme",
  "output": "This guide is designed to help developers create a product that seamlessly integrates both AI and Robotics, while having a visually appealing cartoon theme. \n\nFirstly, when starting out, it is important to get an idea of how the final product should look. Creating a storyboard can help map out the key components and interactions within the product. Storyboarding should take into account the personality and context of the comic, in order to make sure that the product doesn\u2019t seem out of place.\n\nSecondly, when building the product, make sure to use a progressive design process. Starting with simplistic designs, and slowly adding complexity with each iteration. This approach will ensure that all components of the product can be completed while avoiding potential issues.\n\nFinally, be sure to consider how the product could be used by different users. This can be done by creating scenarios and prototypes that can be tested. This will help identify problems and provide feedback. \nTesting the product is an important part of the developers\u2019 workflow, as it allows developers to fine-tune their creations before they are released to the public.",
