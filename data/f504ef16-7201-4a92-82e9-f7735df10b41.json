  "output": "I recently visited the TexMex Restaurant and had an amazing experience! The atmosphere was lively and inviting, with bright colors and Mexican art decorating the walls. The menu features a wide selection of authentic Mexican dishes, all of which are made with the freshest and most flavorful ingredients. The burrito I had was amazing - it was packed with grilled veggies, meat, and cheese and was served with freshly made salsa and guacamole. I also sampled the enchiladas which were incredibly flavorful and smothered in delicious and spicy sauces. The service was prompt and attentive, and the prices were reasonable. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone craving Mexican cuisine.",
