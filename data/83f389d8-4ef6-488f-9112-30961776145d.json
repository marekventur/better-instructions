  "output": "Owning a pet comes with many costs, both upfront and ongoing. Upfront costs for a pet can include the purchase price if you buy it from a breeder or adopt it from an animal rescue, medical examinations and treatments (vaccines, spay/neuter surgeries, etc.), food and litter, and supplies such as a carrier, bed, and toys. Ongoing costs can include veterinary check-ups and treatments, food, pet insurance, training classes, grooming, and boarding when travelling. Additionally, unexpected costs such as emergency veterinary visits can arise at any time.",
