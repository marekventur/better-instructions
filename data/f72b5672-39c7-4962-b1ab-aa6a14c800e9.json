  "output": "The human body has 206 bones that are connected by joints and cartilage. For example, the knee joint is a highly complex connection of four bones, several ligaments, and two menisci that allow for a wide range of motion such as flexion and extension. Without these connections, the knee joint would not be able to provide the body with the flexibility it needs.",
