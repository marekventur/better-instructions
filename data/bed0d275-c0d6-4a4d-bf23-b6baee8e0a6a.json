  "input": "",
  "output": "Quantum computing is based upon the principles of quantum mechanics, which deal with the behavior of particles and systems on the atomic and subatomic level. The underlying technology of quantum computing is based upon the ability to manipulate and control the quantum properties of physical systems such as particles, atoms and photons to process information in ways that are fundamentally different from classical methods. This enables quantum systems to solve problems more quickly and efficiently than conventional systems. Quantum computing leverages the phenomena of quantum entanglement and superposition to perform calculations and operations faster and with a greater degree of accuracy. Other quantum principles such as quantum tunneling and quantum annealing are also foundational aspects of the technology.",
