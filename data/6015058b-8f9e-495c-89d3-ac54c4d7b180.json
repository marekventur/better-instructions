  "input": "",
  "output": "Conditionals are an integral part of programming, as they allow for a program to execute different instructions depending on the input or values defined by the user. They allow for more complex logic and greater flexibility of the code, allowing for decision-making within the program. Conditionals are statements that test whether an expression is true or false, and execute the code based on this outcome. For instance, an \"if-else\" statement allows for multiple paths for the program to choose depending on the conditions being tested. Conditionals are a powerful tool that can be used to customize the behavior of the code based on user input or values.",
