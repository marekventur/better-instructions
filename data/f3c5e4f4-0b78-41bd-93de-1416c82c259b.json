  "input": "",
  "output": "A unique visual to show the relationship between rain and flooding could be a diagram showing the flow of water from a rainfall to a flooded area. The diagram could contain a rain cloud and rain droplets, which could depict the source of water that is ultimately responsible for the flooding. Also, a stream or river could lead from the rain cloud to a flooded field or body of water that has been ravaged by the flooding waters.",
