  "input": "",
  "output": "A blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger of information that is recorded and stored across a distributed network of computers. It is secure, immutable, and can't be modified by any single entity. Blockchains use cryptographic techniques to maintain the integrity and authenticity of data in the ledger and are designed to be resistant to modifications. Transactions are grouped into blocks that are linked together using cryptographic hashes, and new transactions are added to the chain once they are validated by the network. The blocks are continuously verified and stored by the network of computers, and the chain of blocks is visible to anyone interested in seeing it.",
