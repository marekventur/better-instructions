  "instruction": "Recommend a solution to reduce pollution from vehicles",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the most effective solutions to reduce air pollution from vehicles is to promote the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as public transportation and cycling. Governments can subsidize public transportation, install bike lanes, and encourage people to walk and bike based on their needs. In addition, governments should provide incentives to switch to low-emission vehicles, such as electric or hybrid cars, and encourage the use of clean fuels, such as compressed natural gas or biodiesel. Car sharing, as well as driverless technologies, will also help reduce the number of vehicles on the road, resulting in less pollution.",
