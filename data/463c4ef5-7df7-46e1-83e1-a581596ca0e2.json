  "input": "",
  "output": "Evidence-based decision-making is a process in which decisions are made based on factual information and evidence, rather than on intuition, opinion, or guesswork. It involves gathering, analyzing, and interpreting all relevant data and information before making an informed decision. This method helps ensure that decisions are based on reliable sources of information and that they lead to more successful outcomes. By taking the time to gather research and evaluate evidence, decision-makers can make decisions that are more informed, improving the likelihood of success.",
