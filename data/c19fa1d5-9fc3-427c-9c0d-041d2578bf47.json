  "instruction": "Describe the process for solving this equation",
  "input": "2x + 3y = 6",
  "output": "To solve this equation, first subtract 3y from both sides of the equation. This leaves 2x = 6 - 3y. Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2, which gives x = (6 - 3y) / 2. Finally, substitute this value for x in the original equation and solve for y. This gives y = (6 - 2x) / 3.",
