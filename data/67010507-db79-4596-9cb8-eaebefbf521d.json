  "output": "Love moves in mysterious ways,\nMessing up expectations and raising dismay.\nIt rains on our parades,\nFlooding us with loves sweet waves.\n\nDays go by like flashes in the sky,\nMaking me love-sick and asking why.\nTossing and turning until morning light,\nStirs my love-struck heart and takes flight.\n\nLove is held in moments of joy,\nFilling sadness with a delightful ploy.\nWe cherish its presence like a brand-new toy,\nBringing us emotions we can't deploy.\n\nThough love is a tricky minefield to cross,\nWe take the risk to sing and to fill with sauce.\nLiving our lives with a true human toss,\nValuing love and never feeling loss.",
