  "output": "I once had to demonstrate mental strength when I was in a very difficult situation. I was a freshman in college, and was struggling to find a sense of belonging. I was surrounded by a large group of people, most of whom I didn't know, and I was feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Despite this, I forced myself to stay positive and focused on my goals for that year. I joined a few committees and eventually found my place on campus. It took a lot of courage and resilience to stay positive and keep going, but it ultimately served as a reminder to always stay optimistic and never give up.",
