  "input": "",
  "output": "Technology is increasingly used to help reduce energy consumption and conserve resources. Smart home devices can be used to automate energy use, allowing homeowners to set times where lights and other appliances are turned off or put into standby mode. Smart thermostats can also be used to help regulate temperatures in a home, providing only the heat or air conditioning necessary. Solar panels can be used to generate clean, renewable energy, while electric vehicles help reduce emissions and improve air quality. Energy efficient technologies such as LED lighting and low-flow plumbing fixtures can also help reduce energy consumption and costs.",
