  "input": "",
  "output": "Smoking should be banned in public spaces as it can cause significant health risks to those who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Additionally, tobacco smoke can lead to severe long-term medical conditions that can be both expensive and difficult to treat. On the other hand, some people argue that while smoking should be regulated and restricted, it should not be banned in public spaces as it is a matter of personal choice and banning it altogether is an infringement on people\u2019s rights.",
