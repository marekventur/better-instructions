  "output": "The ever-fleeting seconds, minutes, hours and days,\nA reminder of mortality in many ways.\nThe past remains lost, the present fleeting too,\nOnly the future exists, but what will we do?\n\nSo much potential, so much potential lost,\nWithout time to live life will never come to cost.\nOften times we lose ourselves to a distant dream,\nBut it cannot be if we don't find the time to live the dream.\n\nA single moment can make all the difference,\nJust make sure to use this reminder of time to enhance.\nA life filled with love, peace and passion,\nThese moments treasured in metaphorical fashion.\n\nWe can never get back the time that has been had,\nBut we can fill our lives with moments that will never be sad.\nSo let us cherish the present, for it will one day be past,\nWhere the part that was once lived can no longer last.",
