  "instruction": "What is Fibonacci number?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. So the next number in the sequence would be 1+0=1, followed by 1+1=2, then 2+1=3, and so on. The Fibonacci sequence is named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, who introduced the sequence to European mathematics in the 13th century.",
