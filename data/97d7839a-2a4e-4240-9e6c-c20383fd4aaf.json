  "output": "The marketing strategy for the hypothetical pet food company should have several components, including leveraging digital and traditional channels. Digital channels such as social media, website, email, and mobile should be utilized, reaching out to customers with engaging content such as stories, product information, and discounts to ignite interest. Traditional channels such as television, radio, print and outdoor media should also be employed for maximum brand visibility. \n\nIn addition, customer feedback should be actively sought, and customer feedback surveys should be implemented. Finally, partnerships should be developed to reach out to various customer segments, such as breeders, kennels, pet retailers, and veterinarians. With these strategies in place, the pet food company can effectively reach, interact and engage its target customer base.",
