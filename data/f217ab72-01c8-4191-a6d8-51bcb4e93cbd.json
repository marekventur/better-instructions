  "input": "",
  "output": "The major challenges associated with using Artificial Intelligence in healthcare include data availability and reliability, privacy concerns, determining trustworthiness, integration of AI into existing medical systems, and the potential for AI to take decisions away from healthcare professionals. \nData availability and reliability are a challenge as AI algorithms need vast amounts of data to be reliable and accurate. Healthcare data is often highly sensitive, making privacy a major concern with the use of AI in healthcare. It can also be difficult to determine the trustworthiness of AI-based decisions, as biases can unintentionally be introduced into the AI algorithm. AI also presents the challenge of needing to be integrated into existing medical systems while also being secure and efficient. Finally, there is the concern that AI could potentially take decision-making away from healthcare professionals, which could lead to an erosion of trust in the healthcare system.",
