  "output": "I would design a robotic vacuum cleaner that could be programmed to clean any room of the house. It would be equipped with sensors to detect dirt and dust particles and could vacuum and mop simultaneously to save time. The robotic vacuum cleaner could also be programmed to clean based on the user's preferences and schedules. Additionally, it would be self-charging and could return to its docking station when the battery is running low.",
