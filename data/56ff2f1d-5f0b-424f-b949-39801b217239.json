  "output": "Four different types of healthy eating habits include eating a variety of different foods, limiting the amount of processed foods, eating smaller portions, and eating more natural, unprocessed foods.  Eating a variety of different foods helps ensure that you are getting a balanced diet that includes all of the necessary nutrients. Limiting processed foods helps to avoid eating empty calories or unhealthy additives. Eating smaller portions helps to ensure that you are not overeating. Eating more natural, unprocessed foods is generally healthier than processed foods and can help improve overall health.",
