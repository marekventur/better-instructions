  "output": "The evolution of the Internet began in the late 1960s with the development of ARPANET, the precursor to the modern-day Internet. This early version of the Internet was used primarily by the US military, universities, and corporations to share resources and information. It wasn\u2019t until the late 1980s that the Internet was made available to the public, and the early 1990s saw a massive expansion of connectivity and access. This period gave rise to a number of new technologies, including email, FTP, HTML, and most notably, the World Wide Web. The Internet continued to evolve and expand in the 2000s with the introduction of social media, online streaming, and cloud computing. Now, the Internet is used by billions of people around the world and allows us to interact, share ideas, and access information like never before.",
