  "input": "A genetic algorithm",
  "output": "A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic used in artificial intelligence and which is inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. It works by creating a population of possible solutions to a problem, by encoding the candidate solutions as chromosomes. The algorithm evaluates each solution and rewards those which are better, selecting them to pass on their traits to the next generation. This process is analogous to natural selection in that better solutions are selected and \"bred\" in order to create further generations which are often even better solutions to the same problem.",
