  "instruction": "Explain why the Pacific Northwest is prone to earthquakes?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The Pacific Northwest is particularly prone to earthquakes due to its location in the Cascadia Subduction Zone, where two tectonic plates converge. The Juan de Fuca Plate is slowly being subducted underneath the North American Plate, pushing up the continental shelf and creating the unique geology of the Pacific Northwest. The movement of the tectonic plates also causes massive amounts of friction, which can produce a huge amount of energy. This energy is released in the form of earthquakes, making the Pacific Northwest especially prone to seismic activity.",
