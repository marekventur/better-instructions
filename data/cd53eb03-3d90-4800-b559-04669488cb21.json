  "input": "The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s",
  "output": "The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s is personally relevant to me as it shaped the world I live in today and gave me and generations of people like me the rights and opportunities that were denied to us in the past. It gave us the chance to pursue our dreams, regardless of the color of our skin, and it opened the door to true equality and justice. Growing up I was able to learn about the efforts and sacrifices of those involved in the movement, and these stories still influence me to this day.",
