  "input": "",
  "output": "Transfer learning is a technique in Artificial Intelligence (AI) which leverages knowledge gained from one task and uses it to solve another. It helps both speed up the process of training an AI model and also improve the overall accuracy of its predictions. For example, a model trained on image classification could be used to identify objects in a video or a language model trained on one type of text corpus could be used for another.",
