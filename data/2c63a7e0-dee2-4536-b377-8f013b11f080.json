  "instruction": "Design an experiment to test the flexibility of an artificial intelligence system.",
  "input": "The artificial intelligence system is capable of playing chess.",
  "output": "One way to test the flexibility of an AI system is to devise a test where it plays several different types of chess-related games. This could include traditional chess, four-person chess, three-dimensional chess, chess variants such as atomic chess, or any other variation of the game. The idea is to have the AI system play multiple types of variations to observe how it adapts to different rules and strategies.",
