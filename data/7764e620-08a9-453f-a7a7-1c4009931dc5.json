  "output": "Tiffany and Billy were two teenagers living in a small town. Every day they faced the same mundane struggles - bills had to be paid, Summer jobs had to be taken and the little joys of life had to be fought for. One day, a stranger came to town with a plan to help them make some money so that they could seize the moment and take a much-needed break. As they set off on their joint adventure, they found their worries of everyday life fading away into the horizon, but the new challenges they faced were far more dangerous and the stakes much higher than they had even anticipated.",
