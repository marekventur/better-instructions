  "instruction": "Analyze the following speech for its argumentative and rhetorical strategies.",
  "input": "\u201cWe must act now and work towards a cleaner and greener future. We can no longer afford to be complacent and ignore the harms of our actions on this planet. We must take responsibility and strive towards a healthier and more sustainable world.\u201d",
  "output": "The speaker is using an argumentative appeal to urge the audience to act now. By emphasizing the urgency of their task, they are trying to convince the listeners that their current inaction is costly and potentially harmful. They are also presenting an ethical appeal, emphasizing responsibility for the current state of the environment and for taking steps to improve it. Furthermore, the speaker is attempting to make a connection with the audience by speaking from a shared perspective and by employing pathos in the argument by speaking to the collective conscience of the community.",
