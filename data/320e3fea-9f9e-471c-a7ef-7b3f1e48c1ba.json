  "instruction": "Find proof for the following statement: All humans are born with an innate sense of morality.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Studies have found that even babies as young as six months old display moral behavior, such as favoring prosocial outcomes and avoiding antisocial outcomes. This suggests that human morality is innate rather than learned. In addition, research on primitive cultures around the world have found that all of them have taboos and laws, suggesting that a sense of morality is universal in all humans.",
