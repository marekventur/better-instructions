  "input": "",
  "output": "This design could feature the name of the restaurant prominently on the top of the page with a stunning accompanying image. Underneath this, call-to-action buttons such as \u201cView Menu\u201d, \u201cMake a Reservation\u201d, and \u201cTake a Tour\u201d could be featured to direct users to relevant pages. A feature to call the restaurant can also be included. The menus, photos of the inside, a map to locate the restaurant, and other information about the restaurant should be accessible from other pages that the user can access from the main page.",
