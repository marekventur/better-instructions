One day, the rabbit decided to play a trick on the fox and hid in a nearby hollow log. When the fox realized he was gone, he quickly started searching for him, but soon realized that he'd been tricked. Furious, the fox decided to teach the rabbit a lesson and so that day, the fox taught the rabbit the lesson that even if you can trick people, they will eventually seek justice.",
