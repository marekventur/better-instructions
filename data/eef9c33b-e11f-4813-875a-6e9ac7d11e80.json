  "output": "A programming language can be compared to the building blocks for a house, providing the foundation that is necessary for the structure. Similarly, an API can be compared to the blueprints for the house, providing the instructions on how to put the blocks together to build the structure. It is important that both the building blocks and the blueprints are used in order for the house to be built properly.",
