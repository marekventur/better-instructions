  "input": "",
  "output": "Self-supervised learning is a beneficial approach to Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it allows for the use of unlabeled text data in order to create models. In NLP, it is often difficult to obtain labeled data in a language of interest, due to limited resources. With self-supervised learning, machines can learn from the structure of text without needing labels. This is beneficial because machines can learn the inherent features and structure of language which can then be used for tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis.",
