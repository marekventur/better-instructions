  "instruction": "Create a plan for composting food scraps.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A composting plan should start with gathering a bin, tumbler, or pile to hold and rotate the compost ingredients. The compost pile should consist of alternating layers of green (food scraps, tea bags, coffee grounds, and egg shells) and brown materials (leaves, straw, and shredded newspaper). Keep the compost moist but not soggy, and turn it regularly. Also, keep the compost in a warm, moist spot away from direct sunlight and if necessary, add some soil or a soil starter to help it decompose. Lastly, the compost needs to sit for a few months before it is ready for use in the garden.",
