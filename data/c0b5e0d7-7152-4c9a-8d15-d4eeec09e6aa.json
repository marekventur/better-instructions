  "output": "An efficient way to proofread an article is to read it aloud, which makes it easier to pick up on typos and grammatical errors. Read through the article twice, once for content and a second time for proofreading. If possible, have someone else read through the article to get a second opinion as fresh eyes can also identify mistakes that you may have missed. Additionally, use grammar checkers or online proofreading tools to quickly detect any errors.",
