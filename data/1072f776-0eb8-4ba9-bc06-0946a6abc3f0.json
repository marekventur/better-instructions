  "output": "When we think of a risky relationship, we often think of the exhilaration of adventure, excitement, and even passion. However, these relationships can also be high risk as they can quickly become unhealthy or even toxic. While they may be intense, they can involve a great deal of instability, insecurity, and manipulation. The individuals involved may find themselves in an emotionally draining cycle of uncertainty, fear, and anxiety that can lead to poor physical and mental health. Such relationships don't have to be negative though, as long as both people are aware of the risks and can create boundaries and communication to ensure that both parties\u2019 needs are being met.",
