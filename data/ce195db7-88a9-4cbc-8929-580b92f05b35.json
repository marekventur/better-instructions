  "instruction": "Design an algorithm based on a given dataset.",
  "input": "The given dataset contains 10 different variables across 50 observations.",
  "output": "The algorithm should be designed to analyze the dataset, identify patterns and predictions that can be made from the data, and then create a model to help with prediction or decision-making. The algorithm should feature step-by-step instructions for analyzing the data, an evaluation system of the models created, and a plan for how to use the model to draw conclusions.",
