  "output": "Machine Learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms use statistical techniques to find patterns in large data sets and use these patterns to make predictions and decisions. ML algorithms can be used in a wide range of applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, bioinformatics, robotics, and autonomous driving.",
