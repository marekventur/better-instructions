  "output": "The Roman Empire began with the founding of the city of Rome in 753 B.C. and lasted until 476 A.D. It was one of the most influential empires of its time and encompassed parts of Europe, Africa and the Middle East. It was marked by its use of engineering and its adherence to the rule of law, as well as its military strength and vast network of trade routes. As the Empire expanded, its culture and values spread throughout the world. Over time, the Roman Empire contributed to the development of modern governmental systems, architecture, law, and literature. It also helped spread Christianity to parts of the world. In 476 A.D., the Roman Empire fell as a result of decreasing military strength and encroaching barbarian tribes.",
