  "input": "",
  "output": "One solution for decreasing road accidents in India is for the government to encourage the use of public transportation and carpooling. This can be facilitated by providing sufficient buses and trains as well as improving infrastructure for roads, bus stops and railway stations. Another solution is to improve access to car safety devices such as airbags, seatbelts and anti-lock brakes, and to educate the public on their use. Additionally, the government can pass laws encouraging helmet usage and stricter punishments for traffic rule violations.",
