AI is being used in various ways to enhance patient care, such as through improving diagnostics, enabling early and precise detection of illness, monitoring critical health parameters, and providing personalized medicine and lifestyle advice. AI is also being used for drug discovery, research, and development, making treatments more precise and tailored to individual patients.
