  "input": "",
  "output": "Occam's Razor is a principle in philosophy and science that states that the simpler explanation is usually the correct one. This principle is often used when trying to explain a phenomenon or to select the best solution to a problem. The \"razor\" is used to cut away extraneous information and assumptions to get to the most likely answer. The principle claims that when there are multiple possible explanations, the simplest is usually the correct one. This is because it is considered unlikely that complicated answers are true when a simpler solution is available. Occam's Razor also states that more assumptions should not be used than necessary in order to explain something, as this can lead to incorrect conclusions.",
