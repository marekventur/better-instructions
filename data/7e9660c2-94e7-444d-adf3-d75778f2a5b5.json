  "input": "",
  "output": "The four main types of clouds are cirrus, stratus, cumulus, and nimbus. Cirrus clouds are high-level clouds composed of ice crystals, and they appear white and feathery. Stratus clouds are low-level clouds that resemble a flat layer, often seen in grey and white. Cumulus clouds are characterised by their puffy and cotton-like appearance, and they often appear as white billowing clouds. Nimbus clouds are thick and heavy clouds associated with intense precipitation.",
