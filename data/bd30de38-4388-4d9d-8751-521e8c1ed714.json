  "output": "The Upward Bow or Urdhva Dhanurasana is a powerful, energizing yoga posture that can help to improve flexibility and posture, strengthen the spine and arms, and increase energy throughout the body. To perform this pose, start by lying flat on your back, then draw your feet up towards your pelvis. Inhale as you press your hands into the floor and lift your chest up towards the sky. Keep your arms straight and engage your core and glute muscles. Hold for 5-20 breaths before slowly releasing and coming back to the floor.",
