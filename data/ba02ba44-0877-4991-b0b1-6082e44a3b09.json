  "input": "Electric vehicles will become more common across the world.",
  "output": "In the future, electric vehicles will become the norm rather than the exception. We will see more electric vehicles on the road and they will slowly start to replace traditional petrol or diesel cars. As electric vehicles become more popular, governments, businesses and individuals will invest more resources in infrastructure and technologies to support their use. This will lead to improved battery range, lower costs and better services for electric vehicle owners.",
