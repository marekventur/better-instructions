  "input": "",
  "output": "An alternative to using plastic bags is to switch to reusable bags, such as canvas or non-woven fabric bags. These bags can be used over and over again and are a much more sustainable option than single-use plastic bags. Reusable bags are also much more durable, providing an extra layer of protection and saving money in the long run.",
