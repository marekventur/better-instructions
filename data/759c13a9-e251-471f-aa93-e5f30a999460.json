To prevent cyber attacks, organizations should ensure comprehensive staff training and education, secure network architecture and secure network operations. To identify potential cyber attacks, organizations should conduct threat assessments and deploy security solutions such as antivirus and anti-malware software. To contain an attack, organizations should establish an incident response plan and deploy architectures to detect, monitor, and identify malicious activity.
