  "output": "The character had a dream of flying on the back of a friendly dragon, soaring through the clouds, the strong wind in their hair. The sky was a brilliant blue, and the sun danced on the clouds, casting glimmers of sparkles on the dragon's glimmering scales. They could feel the freedom of the open sky, and the dragon seemed content to fly in circles with them as their companion.",
