  "instruction": "Develop a machine learning model to predict the price of a given stock.",
  "input": "The historical daily price data of three stocks of a technology company, namely ABC stock, XYZ stock and PQR stock, from the past 5 years.",
  "output": "The machine learning model developed will use the input historical stock prices data to predict the future prices of the mentioned stocks. The model will be trained with the given dataset to extract patterns and trends from the data to generate a more accurate prediction. The Jupyter Notebook will have code written in Python, which will take the input data, train and test the model, and generate the predicted prices.",
