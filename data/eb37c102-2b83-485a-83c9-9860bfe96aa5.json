  "output": "To properly paint a wall, first you must make sure it's clean, otherwise the paint won't stick well. Next, use painter's tape to block off any areas or trim you do not want to paint. When you are ready to begin painting, use a roller brush to evenly spread the paint across the wall. Make sure to use smooth strokes and take breaks in between to prevent dripping or spotting. After the painting is complete, allow plenty of time for it to dry before putting up wall art or decorations.",
