  "output": "The title of the story is: \"The Curious Ant and the Cuddly Bear\". \n\nThe story starts with an ant crawling on the forest floor, exploring its surroundings. Suddenly, the ant sees a bear just a few feet away. As the ant watches intently, the bear begins to make a strange gesture, shaking its paw up and down, and the ant notices something peculiar - the bear is holding a tiny cup of tea. \n\nThe ant is so intrigued that it can\u2019t help but approach the bear, who smiles at the tiny creature. The bear explains to the ant that it loves to drink tea, but can only do so out of its tiny cup. When the ant tells the bear about its desire to try this mysterious drink, the bear allows the ant to sip the tea carefully. \n\nThe ant is amazed by its first sip of tea. Before it knows it, the ant and bear become best friends, drinking tea together and exploring the forest. \n\nMoral of the story: It doesn't matter how small or big you are, friendship knows no size!",
