  "input": "",
  "output": "The statement \"information is power\" is often attributed to the philosopher Francis Bacon. It suggests that knowledge and information are the precursors of power and success. In today's digital age, knowledge can be collected and shared more quickly and easily than ever before, and having access to the right information can give one an edge over the competition. Knowledge gives us the power to make better decisions and understand issues more deeply. It can also serve as a springboard for creative ideas, giving us the ability to shape the world around us.",
