  "instruction": "Describe how an AI-driven chatbot works.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An AI-driven chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to understand and interpret human conversations. Inputs in the form of sentences are fed into the chatbot, which uses NLP and ML algorithms to process the sentence and search for the most appropriate response from its knowledge base. The response is then fed back to the user. The AI-driven chatbot can also further improve its accuracy in understanding conversations by leveraging data collected from conversations with other users.",
