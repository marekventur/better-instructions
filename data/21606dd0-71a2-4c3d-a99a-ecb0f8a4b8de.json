  "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to create oxygen and energy. It begins with sunlight being absorbed by plant chloroplasts, which converts the energy into usable chemical energy. This energy is then used to combine water and carbon dioxide molecules to create glucose, which is the plant's food source, and oxygen is released as a by-product.",
