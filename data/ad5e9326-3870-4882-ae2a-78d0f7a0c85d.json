  "instruction": "Please provide a brief explanation of the differences between a deep learning algorithm and a traditional machine learning algorithm.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Deep learning algorithms are a modern form of machine learning algorithms that use artificial neural networks to learn and make decisions. Compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms are better able to classify complex data sets and are capable of making decisions based on large amounts of data. Deep learning algorithms are more accurate, but they are also more computationally intensive and require more time and resources to train.",
