He could hear something in the woods \u2013 something that sent shivers down his spine and made him paranoid of every step he took. He had been hunting in this forest for years, and yet he had never felt so scared and so alone. \n\nSuddenly he heard a twig snap to his left. His heart racing, Mike slowly began to back away in the direction of the car. Footsteps grew louder and closer, sending his body into a panic. He turned and ran, only to be stopped suddenly by a figure clad in black. The figure raised a gun pointed directly at Mike, and coldly said \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d",
