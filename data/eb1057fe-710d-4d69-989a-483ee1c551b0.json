  "input": "",
  "output": "A rainy day has a distinct atmosphere. The sky is a deep shade of grey, heavy with the promise of precipitation. The air is filled with the scent of damp earth and the sound of rainfall in the distance. The ground is soft, as the moisture has made it mud-like in texture. Fog blankets towering trees and any other objects that are taller than the surrounding land. All of creation feels hush, as if the whole world needs to take a break from the hustle and bustle of life and just enjoy the moment.",
