  "output": "Climate change has several effects on the environment. One effect is an increase in global average temperature, which leads to melting of icebergs, extreme weather events, and a rise in sea levels. Another effect is a decrease in biodiversity due to the destruction of natural habitats caused by extreme weather conditions and rising temperature.",
