  "input": "",
  "output": "A pin code is a security code consisting of a combination of numbers or letters used to confirm the identity of a user. It's typically used in conjunction with login credentials like a username or email address to ensure the user is who they say they are. Some of its advantages include being convenient, being simple to remember, and providing a higher level of security than other authentication methods. Other advantages include portability, since the pin code does not rely on physical factors like fingerprints or facial recognition; and cost, as it does not require any additional hardware for validation.",
