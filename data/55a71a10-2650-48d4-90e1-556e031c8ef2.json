  "input": "",
  "output": "Goal setting is important because it helps to motivate and focus our efforts, keep track of our progress, allow us to measure success and reassess our strategies, increase our awareness of opportunities, and boost our confidence and self-discipline. A goal setting plan should include short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals, and it should be reviewed and revised regularly. It helps us to stay focused, pursue our goals in the most effective and efficient way, and achieve the results we desire.",
