It is a charming comedy-drama that follows a young woman's journey in finding her true identity while falling in love with a non-Greek man. The movie has a lighthearted tone while also addressing more serious topics such as culture and family. The characters are well-developed, the story is engaging, and the ending is both heartfelt and satisfying.",
