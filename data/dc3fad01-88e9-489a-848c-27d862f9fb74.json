  "output": "1. The loop should be changed from 'for (i=0; i<50; i++);' to 'for (i=0; i<50; i++)'.\n2. The variable 'total' has not been initialized to a value before the loop. It should be initialized to 0 before the loop.\n3. The variable 'i' is not declared before the loop. It should be declared before the loop.\n4. The increment operator '++' is missing in the loop. It should be added after 'i'.\n5. The operator '+=' is missing before 'total'. It should be added before 'total'. The code should be 'total += i;' instead of 'total = i;'.",
