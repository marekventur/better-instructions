  "input": "No Input",
  "output": "Hoarding is a complex psychological phenomenon that is often associated with deep-seated emotional issues such as anxiety, depression, and trauma. Hoarders often have difficulty making decisions due to underlying feelings of insecurity, and thus tend to collect items as a way to cope. Hoarders also tend to value items for their sentimental value, feeling that they cannot let the items go. Hoarding is also associated with difficulty organizing, categorizing, and discarding items, which can further complicate the problem.",
