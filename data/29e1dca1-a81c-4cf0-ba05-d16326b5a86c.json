  "output": "Alice met her one true love at a small cafe near the beach when they were both 17. It didn't take long for them to realize they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. Though they had never known what it felt like to be apart, they promised each other to stay with one another forever. \n\nEvery day brought them closer, and soon the two were inseparable. Even when Alice was working on her studies, she'd make time for her beloved. And when things were difficult, a gentle reminder of the promise kept it all together. \n\nYears passed and Alice knew that everything she had in life, she owed to her beloved. She was sure that no promise was as powerful as the one they'd made that day at the cafe. That no matter what, they'd stay with each other forever.",
