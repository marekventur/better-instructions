  "input": "",
  "output": "Lady Macbeth is an ambitious, calculating character. She is driven by her own ambition and her manipulation of her husband to seize power. She is powerful and strong-willed and is able to convince Macbeth to kill Duncan, despite his initial reluctance. Lady Macbeth can also be ruthless, and she is willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure her own success. She is not concerned with morality and is willing to commit or condone any act, no matter how foul, if it serves her own purposes.",
