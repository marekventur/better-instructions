  "input": "",
  "output": "The Lewis dot structure for carbon dioxide (CO2) is as follows:\nCarbon (C) is surrounded by two double bonds, each composed of two oxygen atoms, each with two lone pairs for a total of four lone pairs. The Lewis dot structure would display the carbon atom in the center with four lines representing the bonds, and two dots for the two lone pairs on each of the oxygen atoms.",
