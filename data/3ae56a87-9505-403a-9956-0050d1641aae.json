  "output": "Three advantages of using artificial neural networks for machine learning are: \n1. They are able to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately.\n2. They are based on a similar structure to the human brain, which means they can learn from their inputs and adapt to new data.\n3. They have the ability to generalize, meaning they can make accurate predictions outside of the training data.",
