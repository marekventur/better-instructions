  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Plastic straws are made of non-biodegradable materials and are a major source of pollution and waste.\n2. Straws are frequently found in our waterways, beaches and oceans, where they threaten marine life through ingestion and entanglement.\n3. Plastic straws break down into microscopic particles that can enter our food chain and cause harm to humans. \n4. Many cities and countries have already moved to ban the use of plastic straws in order to mitigate the damaging effects of single-use plastic.\n5. Alternatives to plastic straws are readily available, such as paper, bamboo or stainless steel straws, which are better for the environment and involve no harm to animals.",
