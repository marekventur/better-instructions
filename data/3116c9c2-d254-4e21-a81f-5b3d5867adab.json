  "input": "",
  "output": "A version control system is important because it helps to manage changes to a project. It records changes to the project over time and allows you to easily \"roll back\" any changes if there is an issue or mistake. It also allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project, as everyone can be tracked and changes can be easily reverted if needed.",
