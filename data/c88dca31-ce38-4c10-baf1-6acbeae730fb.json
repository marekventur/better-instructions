  "output": "Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning that deals with learning how to make a sequence of decisions. In this kind of learning, an agent interacts with an environment in order to maximize its accumulated rewards. The agent makes choices based on its observations from the environment and then receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. With time, the agent learns to maximize its potential rewards by optimizing its choices.",
