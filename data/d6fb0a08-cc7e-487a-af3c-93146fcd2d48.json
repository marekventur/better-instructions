  "output": "To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless classic. Written by Harper Lee, the novel tells the story of racial injustice in the American South through the eyes of growing up in a small town. Atticus Finch, the protagonist, serves as a moral compass for his daughter and the reader as he takes on the case of defending a black man falsely accused of rape. Through the course of the novel, Atticus teaches his daughter about courage and empathy. Despite the heavy themes, the novel is ultimately hopeful and inspiring. It is an essential piece of literature that will remain relevant for centuries to come.",
