  "output": "Due process is a legal principle that \"all legal proceedings must be fair and that individuals must be given notice of the proceedings and a reasonable opportunity to be heard in a meaningful manner.\" This means that any action taken by the government that could deprive someone of their rights or freedoms must follow the law, and any actions taken must be fair and balanced. In the context of law, due process ensures that individuals receive fair and equal treatment when it comes to their legal rights and obligations.",
