  "output": "The Industrial Revolution was a period of time in the 18th and 19th centuries marked by a shift from manual labor and methods of production to automated processes and machinery. This change in production had a wide-reaching economic,political, and social impact, enabling mass production of goods, leading to a rise in urbanization, and increasing prosperity. This revolution was spurred by the invention of new technologies and machinery, such as the steam engine, which enabled more efficient production. The Industrial Revolution eventually spread to all of Europe, North America, and beyond, creating a new and more industrialized age.",
