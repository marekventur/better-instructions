  "output": "There is often a disagreement between scientists and the public about certain topics because the public may not have access to the same level of information or context the scientists have when examining an issue, or because the public may have a different set of values or perspectives on the subject than the scientists. Therefore, their conclusions or interpretations may not always be in agreement.",
