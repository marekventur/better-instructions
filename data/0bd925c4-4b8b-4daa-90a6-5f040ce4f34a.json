  "input": "",
  "output": "My most challenging project was when I worked on an AI-based natural language processing system to detect fraud in financial transactions. It required my team to build a hefty infrastructure to monitor large volumes of text data, along with a custom machine learning solution to accurately detect fraud patterns. Additionally, since the system was deployed in a live production environment, we faced tight deadlines and had to be extra vigilant to ensure the reliability and performance of our system.",
