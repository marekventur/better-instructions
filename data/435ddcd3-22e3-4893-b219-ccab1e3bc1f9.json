  "output": "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to display data, while JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. HTML is designed to display data in a structured format, while JSON is designed to transmit data between a server and a web application. HTML documents contain tags, while JSON objects contain data in name/value pairs. HTML documents are usually rendered in the browser, while JSON is primarily used to transfer data between a server and web application.",
