  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change and ocean acidification are closely related. The emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, primarily due to human activity, is responsible for the global rise in temperatures. As the atmosphere warms, more of this carbon dioxide gets dissolved into the ocean which causes the acidity levels in the ocean to increase and for the ocean to become more acidic. This process is known as ocean acidification and it can have serious implications for marine ecosystems, including disruptions in the food chain and reduced levels of biodiversity.",
