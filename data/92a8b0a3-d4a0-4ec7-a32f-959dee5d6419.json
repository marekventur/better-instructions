  "instruction": "Describe the primary benefits of a multi-factor authentication system.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A multi-factor authentication system provides better security for sensitive data compared to traditional password-only authentication. It uses multiple methods to verify a user's identity, such as a password, a hardware token, biometric data, SMS verification code, or a combination of these. This makes it more difficult for hackers to gain access to accounts, protecting user data from unauthorized access. Additionally, multi-factor authentication provides greater convenience, as users can sign in more quickly and conveniently.",
