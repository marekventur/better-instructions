  "output": "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge written in 1798. It tells the story of a mariner who has broken the code of conduct of a sailor by killing an albatross, and is forced to wander the sea from experience to experience in search of penitence. The poem closely follows the idea of the supernatural, with themes of death, the supernatural, and redemption. Coleridge also incorporates vivid imagery, a strict rhyme scheme, and the use of religious symbols throughout the poem.  The key features of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner include characters that represent different aspects of human nature, a dark and foreboding atmosphere, a focus on failed morality, and an exploration of how an individual's actions can cause global effects.",
