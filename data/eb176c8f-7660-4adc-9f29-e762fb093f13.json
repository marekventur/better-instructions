  "input": "",
  "output": "Customer feedback is crucial for companies as it provides valuable insight into customer satisfaction, which is linked to customer retention, customer loyalty, and customer advocacy. Customer satisfaction enables companies to identify areas of improvement, identify customer preferences and interests, and make necessary changes to their products and services to better meet customer needs. Satisfied customers are more likely to remain loyal to the company and more likely to advocate for the company to their contacts. As such, customer feedback is critical in order to identify and assess customer satisfaction levels.",
