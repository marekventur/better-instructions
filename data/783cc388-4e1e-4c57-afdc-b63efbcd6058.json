  "output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that uses sophisticated algorithms to enable computers to think like humans and solve complex problems. AI works by taking a problem and breaking it down into pieces that the computer can understand. The machine then looks for patterns in data and creates models or a \u201cdecision tree\u201d to make informed decisions. For example, facial recognition uses AI to look for patterns in a person\u2019s face to identify them. AI can also be used to analyze large sets of data to identify correlations and trends that humans may miss.",
