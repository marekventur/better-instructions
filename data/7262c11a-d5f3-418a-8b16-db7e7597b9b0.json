  "input": "",
  "output": "A comprehensive system to mitigate the effects of climate change should have multiple components. On a global scale, there should be an effective policy framework that reduces emissions, encourages energy conservation, and promotes the use of renewable energy sources. On a local level, there should be programs to help communities adapt to the changing climate and build resilience against the impacts of climate change. Additionally, measures such as reforestation, habitat restoration and land management should be implemented to reduce emissions and promote sustainability.",
