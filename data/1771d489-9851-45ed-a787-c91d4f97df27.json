  "instruction": "Compare and contrast horror movies from the 70s to ones made today.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Movies from the 70s were more focused on suspense, with the tension amplified by slow pacing and visuals that were often exaggerated or disturbingly surreal. They tended to be more psychological in nature, so the protagonist would face an unseen danger that the audience had to imagine but never see. Movies today tend to be faster-paced, relying more on jump scares and special effects that show explicit horror. While modern movies still have psychological elements, they tend to be more explicit in how they depict the horror, often showing what is causing the terror in graphic detail. Furthermore, modern horror movies tend to be more focused on the protagonists surviving the physical danger they face.",
