  "output": "A plan to address cyberbullying should include educating the public, especially children and teenagers, on the risks and consequences of cyberbullying. Effective measures should be taken to raise awareness of the prevalence of cyberbullying and the resulting dangers. Additionally, social media platforms should be held accountable for the content posted there, and they should make sure they are actively preventing cyberbullying. Financial penalties or prosecutions can help discourage bullying behavior online.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s essential to have policies in place that protect victims of cyberbullying. Providing victims with resources and support, including mental health services, is also important for helping them recover from their experiences. Finally, it\u2019s important to empower victims by providing them with the tools, resources, and knowledge they need to protect themselves from cyberbullying.",
