  "output": "Boolean data type is a data type that can have only two values: true or false. It is often used to express logic and is often used in programming logic and databases. For example, you could use boolean data type to check whether a user has entered in the correct password. If the user entered the wrong password, the boolean data type would return false; if the user entered the correct password, it would return true.",
