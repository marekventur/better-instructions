  "input": "",
  "output": "The formula for calculating tire wear is: Tire Wear (%) = (Start Tread Depth - Current Tread Depth)*100 / Start Tread Depth. This formula is based on the tire tread depth being measured in millimeters. The Start Tread Depth is the original tread depth when the tire is new, and the Current Tread Depth is the tread depth measured at the time of calculation.",
