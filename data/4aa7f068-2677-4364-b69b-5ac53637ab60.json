  "instruction": "Generate a drawing of an abstract artwork",
  "input": "",
  "output": "I would generate a drawing of an abstract artwork using geometric shapes. I might start by using rectangles, triangles and circles to create a unique composition. I could then add depth and texture to my drawing by including various lines and patterns. I could use shading to make the artwork look three-dimensional and experiment with different colors to add brightness. I could also incorporate various textures and finishes to make my artwork stand out. Overall, I could create an artwork that is visually appealing and thought-provoking.",
