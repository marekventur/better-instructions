  "output": "Problem-solution essays take a complex problem and provide potential solutions to the issue. For example, a problem-solution essay could address the impact of the rise of technology on the environment. In the essay, the writer would first define the complexity of the problem and explain how technology has contributed to it. The essay would then delve into potential solutions such as policies that limit the emission of greenhouse gases or encouraging people to recycle. Additionally, the essay would also explain how these solutions could be implemented.",
