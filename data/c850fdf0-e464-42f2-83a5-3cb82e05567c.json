  "instruction": "Explain why the given investment is a bad decision.",
  "input": "Buying shares in a tech company with no competitive edge",
  "output": "Investing in a company with no competitive edge is a bad decision because it does not have a unique product or service to stand out from its competitors. This lack of a competitive edge means that the company is likely to lose customers to its competitors which will lead to lower earnings. Additionally, the lack of a competitive edge also means that it will be difficult for the company to find investors to fund its operations, meaning that it may not survive in the long run.",
