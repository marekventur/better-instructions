  "output": "Starting a business is both exciting and daunting, and there are many things that you must consider before taking the plunge. Here are some pieces of advice for those just starting out:\n\n1. Thoroughly research the industry you are entering. Make sure you understand the competitive landscape and what sets your business apart from the competition.\n\n2. Create a business plan. This document should include your mission statement and a financial plan for your business, including forecasts for revenue and operating expenses.\n\n3. Create a detailed budget and stay within your means. Make sure to account for unexpected expenses, as they will likely arise.\n\n4. Take the time to protect your business that you create. Get business insurance and take steps to ensure that your business is properly registered and complies with local, state, and federal laws.\n\n5. Surround yourself with knowledgeable people. Seek out the advice of experienced business owners, especially those in the same industry, who can give you sound advice. \n\n6. Always prioritize the customer. Stay focused on providing a great experience for your customers and creating value for their lives.\n\n7. Don't be afraid to pivot. If something isn\u2019t working, don\u2019t be afraid to try something new. It\u2019s okay if your original plans don\u2019t pan out, as long as you stay focused on your goals and make adjustments when needed.",
