  "output": "Once upon a time, there were three animals: a fox, a tiger and a donkey. The fox had a brilliant plan to outwit the tiger: he convinced the donkey to dress up as a clown and perform an act for the tiger. The donkey, however, was not used to performing in front of large audiences, so the fox had to coach him on what to do. The tiger was so entertained that he forgot all about trying to catch the fox. The fox and the donkey lived happily ever after, and sometimes still do clown performances for other animals in the forest!",
