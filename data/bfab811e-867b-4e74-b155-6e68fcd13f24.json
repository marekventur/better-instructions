  "output": "Biodiversity loss is the loss of plant and animal species due to human activities, such as the destruction of habitats, poaching, the introduction of non-native species, and the effects of global warming. The issue has become increasingly serious over the last century, with species becoming extinct at a rate 1,000 times faster than they were before the start of human civilization. This biodiversity loss is cause for deep concern, as the plants and animals of our planet are essential to a healthy and balanced ecosystem. We must all work together to reduce our environmental footprint and protect our global biodiversity.",
