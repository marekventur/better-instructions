  "instruction": "Explain why the color of the sky is blue.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The sky appears blue because of the way that sunlight interacts with the gases and particles in the Earth's atmosphere. Sunlight is made up of different frequencies of light, and when the light passes through these particles, the shorter wavelengths of light (the blues) are scattered more than the longer wavelengths (the reds). This scattering causes most of the light to appear blue, making the sky blue.",
