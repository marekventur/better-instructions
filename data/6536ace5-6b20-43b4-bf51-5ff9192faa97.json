  "output": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) which are widely used in deep learning applications. They are designed to learn over long periods of time, unlike standard artificial neural networks which are usually limited to only learning over shorter periods of time. LSTMs have a feedback loop that allows information to be stored over long periods of time in memory cells, allowing them to \u201cremember\u201d past events and learn from them in order to make more accurate predictions.",
