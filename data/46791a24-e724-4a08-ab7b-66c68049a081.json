  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural language processing (NLP) is the process of using machine learning algorithms to extract and analyze the meaning of human language. For text classification, the process involves first preprocessing the text by tokenizing it and removing irrelevant data, such as stop words. Next, features such as n-grams and part-of-speech tags can be extracted from the text. Finally, the features can be used to train a classification model, such as a support vector machine or logistic regression, which can be used to classify the text into a pre-defined set of categories. The process can be automated and is highly scalable, making it an excellent tool for text classification.",
