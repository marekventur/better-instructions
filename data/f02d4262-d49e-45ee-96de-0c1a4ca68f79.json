  "output": "This STEM activity is designed for 5th graders, and will help them to understand the principles of solid geometry. \n\nFirst, provide each student with a stack of foam cubes. These can be any variety, but should include shapes like cubes, pyramids, cylinders, etc. Give each student a few toothpicks and squares of extra foam, and ask them to use these to build a large, stable structure that includes all the different shapes. \n\nOnce the structures are complete, help the students to measure each side or face. Discuss with them the different shapes and angles. Have them calculate the volume of each shape and collective volume of their structure. Finally, have the students write about the most interesting thing they found when constructing and measuring their structure.",
