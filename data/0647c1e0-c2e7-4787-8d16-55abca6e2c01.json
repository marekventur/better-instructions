  "output": "In 2040, a typical day begins with a sunrise virtual reality experience before stepping into an automated shower and getting dressed in a self-cleaning fabric outfit. After breakfast, commuting consists of hopping into a self-driving car or flying an autonomous drone to work. At work, meetings are held via holographic technology, and lunch is often spent catching up with neighbours or relatives living in other parts of the world via augmented reality video conference. After work, flying vehicles and autonomous delivery robots fill the sky and self-driving cars the streets. Virtual restaurants provide a selection of meals that are prepared and delivered to customers\u2019 homes for dinner. In the evening, people spend time in social VR environments to catch up with friends from across the world before heading to bed.",
