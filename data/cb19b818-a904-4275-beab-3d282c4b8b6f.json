  "input": "",
  "output": "Reforming a dysfunctional system involves several steps. Firstly, an analysis of the system needs to be conducted to identify the root causes of the dysfunction. Once the cause has been identified, strategies need to be developed to improve the system. This could involve introducing new policies or revising existing ones, implementing measures to increase accountability and performance, and investing in human and financial resources. Finally, the reformed system must be supported, monitored, and evaluated to ensure that the desired results are achieved.",
