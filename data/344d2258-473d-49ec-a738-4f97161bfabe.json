  "input": "",
  "output": "The differences between a blockchain and an ordinary database can be summarized as follows: \nBlockchain is a distributed ledger, whereas a database is centralized. \nBlockchain is secure and resistant to tampering, because it is protected by cryptography, whereas a database may not be as secure and can be manipulated. \nBlockchain is public and decentralized, while a database is typically maintained by a single entity or organization. \nFinally, blockchain is immutable, meaning that once a transaction has been processed, it cannot be changed or reversed, while a database can be updated or edited.",
