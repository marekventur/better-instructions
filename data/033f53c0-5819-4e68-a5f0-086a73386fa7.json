  "input": "",
  "output": "Turtles might seem like a fun, unique pet option, but it is important to remember that they are wild animals and require special care. They need to live in specific temperatures and humidity levels and eat a specific diet of things like insects, weeds, and vegetables. They can also be very fragile and easily stressed by changes in their environment or even handling, and improper care can cause them to become sick or even die. Therefore, it is important to consider carefully before deciding to bring a pet turtle into your home.",
