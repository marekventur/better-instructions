  "output": "The hair whip! Start by standing with feet shoulder width apart and arms raised. Quickly whip your arms down to the side, making sure to throw your head backwards with the move. Bend your knees to lower your body and add more of an effect to the move. This move looks great when in sync with the beat and looks impressive when combined with other fast-paced moves.",
