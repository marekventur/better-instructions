  "output": "An example of a simple machine learning problem is predicting a house's price based on its characteristics like size, location, number of rooms, etc. This problem can be solved with a regression model where the model is trained on historical data of house prices. Once the model is trained, it can be used to accurately predict the price of any new house.",
