  "output": "The California Clean Truck, Bus and Off-Road Regulation (formally known as the Truck and Bus Regulation) is the state's existing motor vehicle emissions standard for trucks, buses, and certain off-road vehicles. The rule sets limits on harmful emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions from these vehicles, and requires that they use low-sulfur diesel fuel. The regulation also requires vehicle owners to perform annual inspections, maintain their vehicles, and demonstrate compliance with the regulation.",
