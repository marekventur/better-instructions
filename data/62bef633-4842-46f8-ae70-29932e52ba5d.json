  "output": "Quantum computers can be thought of as an old, large city library. In a traditional computer, the information is stored in the equivalent of books that are all lined up on the shelves. In a quantum computer, however, the information is more akin to a bookshelf full of books that can all occupy the same space, but still each contain different information. This allows the quantum computer to perform multiple computations simultaneously by using a single quantum state.",
