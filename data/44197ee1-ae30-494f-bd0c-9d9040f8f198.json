  "input": "",
  "output": "Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, offer a clean, reliable, and renewable source of energy. They reduce both our dependence on non-renewable sources of energy, such as coal and oil, as well as harmful emissions. Renewable energy sources are also cost-effective and create jobs in local communities, while also helping to reduce global warming. Furthermore, they can be used to generate power in remote regions, alleviating the need for costly infrastructure and transportation.",
