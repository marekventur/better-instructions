  "instruction": "Design a computer vision model for the following task.",
  "input": "Detecting objects in an image",
  "output": "A computer vision model for detecting objects in an image would involve training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify features in the image and then classes the features into the appropriate object classes. Common techniques involve Transfer Learning, Utilizing Pretrained Model, or building a model from scratch. The trained model would then be used to make predictions in new images.",
