  "input": "",
  "output": "Diophantine equations are equations with integer solutions. The principle of Diophantine equations states that if an integer solution is found, any linear combination of the integer solutions will also give a valid solution. This means the equation has infinitely many solutions, provided that an integer solution is found. This principle is widely used in number theory, cryptography, and other disciplines.",
