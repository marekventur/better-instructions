  "output": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on giving machines the ability to learn and make decisions without human intervention. It works by using algorithms to process data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions. The algorithms are trained on data that has been labeled with correct output, allowing them to learn how to accurately classify future data. After the machine has been trained, it can then make decisions on new data without being manually programmed. For example, a machine learning algorithm can be trained on a large set of images labeled as \u201ccat\u201d or \u201cdog\u201d and then it can be used to accurately identify cats and dogs in new images.",
