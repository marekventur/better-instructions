  "output": "A good strategy to cope with stress in the workplace is to take a step back and take breaks throughout the day. Aim to take short breaks during the day, such as taking a few minutes to stretch, go for a short walk outside, or even just sit and relax with some quiet music. Additionally, it is important to stay organized and make to-do lists to track tasks and prioritize, and to practice self-care.",
