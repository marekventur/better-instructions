  "output": "The goal of software testing is to verify that a program or application is functioning as intended. It is used to identify and correct bugs, errors, and other issues that can potentially impact the program's performance. Additionally, testing helps to ensure that the application meets its stated requirements, as well as any additional business and user requirements. Testing can also be used to explore and discover new features to add to the application.",
