  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a toy rabbit that had been abandoned in the corner of a room, forgotten and ignored. One day, something strange happened - the toy rabbit began to move, as if by magic. It hopped out of the corner, wondering what had happened to make it come to life. It looked around the room, marveling at all the new sights and sounds its long dormant eyes and ears had awoken to witness. The rabbit soon found its way out of the room, discovering a world of adventure and mystery outside, and it set off on an exciting journey of exploration and discovery.",
