  "input": "",
  "output": "Day trading carries a high risk due to its nature of making quick decisions and leveraging large amounts of capital. As with any investment, there is the potential for large profits, but day trading also carries the potential for large losses. The high leverage also amplifies these losses and can lead to losses that exceed previously invested capital. Furthermore, day traders must be able to accurately and quickly identify market trends and respond appropriately to sudden market shifts. As a result, the success of day trading may depend more on skill and strategy than luck.",
