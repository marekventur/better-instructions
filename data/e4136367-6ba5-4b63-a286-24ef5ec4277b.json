  "input": "",
  "output": "As the countdown dwindled away in the launchpad, the astronaut eagerly awaited the launch of her first-ever deep space mission. As the rocket surged away, the astronaut watched as the planet became smaller and smaller. After several days of interstellar travel, the astronaut finally reached her destination - a planet many lightyears away in a faraway universe. The astronaut made many discoveries and explored the strange new planet and its alien inhabitants. After several months, the astronaut was ever so closer to home, but she felt an innate sadness at the thought of back leaving. Despite the longing for home, she was filled with a deep sense of purpose and accomplishment. She had come from a tiny speck in the universe, to a place never before explored. No wonder her heart remained on that alien planet in the special moments before she returned home.",
