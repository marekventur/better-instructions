  "output": "A web browser is a software application designed to locate, retrieve, and display content from the internet. It typically consists of five main components: a user interface, an address bar, a browser engine, a rendering engine, and a networking component. The user interface is used to interact with the user, receive input from them, and display output. The address bar holds the URL of the current page, and this is used to access and download resources from the web server. The browser engine is responsible for managing the different components of the browser and the interactions between them. The rendering engine is used to display the content on the user's screen, and the networking component is used to retrieve and load resources.",
