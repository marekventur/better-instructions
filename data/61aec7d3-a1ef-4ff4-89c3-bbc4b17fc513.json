  "output": "The main components of Darwin's theory of evolution are natural selection, variation within a species, heredity, and adaptation over successive generations. Natural selection is the process by which organisms that are well-adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Variation within a species is the basis of evolutionary differences. Heredity is the passing of traits from parent to offspring. Finally, adaptation is the accumulation of changes that allow a species or group of species to become better suited to their environment.",
