  "output": "Lizzie had always been fascinated by the night sky, even when she was a child growing up in a small town in rural Wisconsin. She would spend hours looking up at the stars, imagining all sorts of worlds that existed beyond her small town. When she was old enough, she saved up all her money to buy her first telescope. She set up in a meadow near her house and quickly discovered a passion for astronomy. She soon joined the local star-gazing club and was even able to share her new-found knowledge with her community. Lizzie earned a reputation as the town\u2019s resident astronomer, and her enthusiasm for the stars never faded.",
