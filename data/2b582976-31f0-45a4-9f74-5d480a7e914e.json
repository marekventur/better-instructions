  "output": "Electricity and magnetism are both forms of energy, but they are different. Electricity is the movement of electrons, and magnetism is the force generated by the motion of electric charges. Electricity can be generated by many methods, including chemical, solar, and nuclear, but magnetism is always generated by the motion of electric charges.",
