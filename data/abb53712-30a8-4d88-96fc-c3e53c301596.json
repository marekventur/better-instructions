  "output": "Three methods of solving a Rubik's cube are the beginner's method, intermediate layer-by-layer method, and advanced Fridrich method. The beginner's method involves solving each side of the cube one color at a time. The intermediate layer-by-layer method involves first solving the edges, then the corners, and then the middle layer. The Fridrich method is a faster variation of the second method, involving solve the cub'es first layer and then the last layer in one step, followed by orienting the top layer.",
