  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a double and a single entry bookkeeping system is that in a double entry system, each transaction or business activity is recorded twice in two different accounts, whereas in a single entry system, only one entry is made in a single account. Double entry systems are more accurate and reliable, as all transactions are recorded twice and there is less room for errors.",
