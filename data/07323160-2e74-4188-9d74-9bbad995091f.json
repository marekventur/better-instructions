  "input": "",
  "output": "A non-relational database can be more suitable for certain data operations than a relational one because it offers more flexibility. Non-relational databases provide an open schema which makes it easier to store and access data without having to consider the relationships between data points. Non-relational databases may also be better suited for storing and accessing data quickly, as relational databases require complex queries to retrieve data.",
