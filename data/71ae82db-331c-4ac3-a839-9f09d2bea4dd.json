  "output": "The consequences of climate change on the global ocean include sea level rise, ocean acidification, and changes in ocean circulation, temperature and salinity levels. Sea level rise is mainly caused by the melting of land-based ice and thermal expansion of the ocean due to increased global temperatures. As the climate warms, the atmosphere also retains more water and produces heavier rains and more flooding, leading to further rises in sea level.\n\nAccording to a study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sea levels are projected to rise by 1 to 4 feet (0.3 to 1.2 meters) by the year 2100, with greater rises occurring later in the century. Such a rise would threaten the coastal and island communities, ecosystems, and the infrastructure, such as ports and harbors, that support their economic and social activities. It would also harm the marine biodiversity, and disrupt the ecosystems services and fisheries that depend on them.",
