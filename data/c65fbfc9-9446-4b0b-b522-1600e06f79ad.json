  "instruction": "Analyze the production costs of a movie.",
  "input": "100 million dollars",
  "output": "An analysis of the production costs of a movie made with a budget of 100 million dollars would include the cost of each team member's salary, the cost of equipment rental, the cost of props and costumes, the cost of any sets and special effects, the cost of distribution and marketing, and any administrative fees needed to complete the project. Ultimately, the costs need to be weighed against the potential returns of the movie in order to determine if it is a viable investment.",
