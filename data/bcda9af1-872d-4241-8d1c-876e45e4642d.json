  "input": "",
  "output": "- Reduce energy consumption by turning off unnecessary lights and setting the thermostat to an appropriate temperature. \n- Switch to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power.\n- Improve energy efficiency in transportation by replacing old vehicles with more fuel-efficient ones.\n- Cut down on meat consumption, as the animal agriculture industry contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.\n- Plant more trees as they absorb CO2 as part of photosynthesis.  \n- Insulate homes to trap heat and reduce the need for air conditioning and heating. \n- Reduce the usage of single-use plastics and other non-biodegradable items. \n- Improve waste management by reducing, reusing, and recycling. \n- Educate people on climate change and the importance of curbing emissions. \n- Switch to sustainable and eco-friendly products such as organic cotton and bamboo. \n- Support organizations and politicians with climate-friendly policies.\n- Advocate for environmental causes in your local community. \n- Use public transportation to reduce emissions from our cars. \n- Consolidate errands so that fewer trips are taken in cars. \n- Compost organic waste and mulch yards to reintroduce carbon into the soil.\n- Replace light bulbs with energy-efficient LED bulbs.\n- Be conscious of water usage when showering, doing laundry, and watering plants.\n- Turn off electronics and unplugging extension cords when not in use.\n- Choose energy-efficient appliances when replacing out-of-date models. \n- Look for solar powered options for items such as watches, phone chargers, and calculators.",
