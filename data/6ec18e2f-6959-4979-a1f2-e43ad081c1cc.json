  "output": "A scenario when artificial intelligence may not be the best solution could be when there is a need for social interaction or empathy. AI is limited to structured tasks; it is not capable of providing the same level of emotional support that a human being can. For example, in certain mental health contexts, it is important to have a conversation with a human being that is sensitive to the nuances of emotion rather than an AI agent that is programmed to respond in a certain way. In addition, AI can also be limited to complex and comprehensive tasks that require human reasoning and insight.",
