  "input": "",
  "output": "Computational models can be used in analysing text by automating complex tasks. They are able to quickly process and detect patterns in large amounts of data, enabling accurate and efficient analysis. Furthermore, computational models are not limited by human bias and can help find relationships between features that may have been previously unrecognized. In sum, computational models can be a powerful tool for analyzing text and extracting meaningful information from it.",
