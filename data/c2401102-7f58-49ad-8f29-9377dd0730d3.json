  "output": "String Theory is a branch of theoretical physics that tries to explain the behavior of subatomic particles. It suggests that all particles are made up of tiny strings and these strings vibrate at different frequencies which give them their properties. It further suggests that the universe has many dimensions and the strings can exist in multiple dimensions.",
