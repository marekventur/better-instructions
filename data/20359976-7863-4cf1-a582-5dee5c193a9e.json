  "input": "",
  "output": "Genetic engineering is a process that involves the manipulation of genetic material in a laboratory setting to create new combinations of alleles and traits. Traditional breeding involves the selection of a desired trait and the breeding of two plants with that trait to produce offspring with the desired trait. Genetic engineering is a faster and more precise process than traditional breeding and can create combinations of traits that would be otherwise impossible.",
