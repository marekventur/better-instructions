  "output": "My last week was busy and productive. I completed several projects, exercised regularly, and had time to relax. I finished a few coding tasks at work, met with my team to discuss upcoming plans, and finished the first draft of a paper I\u2019ve been working on. I also took a break to visit the local park with friends, play video games with my siblings, and take time to read a few books.",
