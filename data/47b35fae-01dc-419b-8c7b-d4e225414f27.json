  "input": "",
  "output": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which RNA molecules can suppress the expression of specific genes. It involves introducing double-stranded RNA molecules that are complementary to the target gene, which triggers the degradation of the mRNA of the target gene, thus preventing the translation of the mRNA into a protein. This process is involved in the regulation of gene expression and is important for a variety of biological processes.",
