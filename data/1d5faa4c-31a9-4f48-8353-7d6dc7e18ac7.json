  "instruction": "Create a coda for this song.",
  "input": "Verse 1:\nI used to be so free, my soul untethered\nBut now it's all so clear, I'm lost in this weather\nNever thought I'd be here, weighed down with fear\nVerse 2:\nLightning in a bottle, a life I could shuttle\nTo places never seen, I'm chasing the moonbeam\nBut love doesn't rhyme with a dream",
  "output": "Bridge:\nBut if I dig deep, I know I can find\nThe strength to go on, and a piece of my mind\n\nCoda:\nLife is a journey, one filled with highs and lows\nStruggles along the way, and places to go\nWe'll find the courage to pick ourselves up\nAnd take our lives on a greater journey.",
