  "instruction": "Explain the main arguments on both sides of a current controversy.",
  "input": "Gun control laws",
  "output": "The gun control debate has been going on for decades, and there are two main camps to the argument. Those in favor of gun control argue that guns are too often used for violent or criminal purposes, that gun restrictions can help protect citizens, and that the Second Amendment does not protect the right to carry any type of gun. Those against gun control believe that it violates an individual's right to bear arms, goes against the Second Amendment, and that it would be largely ineffective in reducing crime.",
