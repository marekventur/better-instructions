  "output": "Recently, scientists discovered a new exoplanet orbiting the star Proxima Centauri. This is the closest star to the Sun and the exoplanet is called Proxima Centauri b. It is located about 4.24 light-years away from Earth and is a roughly Earth-sized and possibly rocky planet. Scientists believe this exoplanet could potentially be capable of sustaining life since it is in the habitable zone of its star.",
