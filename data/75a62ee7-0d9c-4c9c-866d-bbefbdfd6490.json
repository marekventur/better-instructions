  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to build more sustainable housing is to use materials that are environmentally friendly and do not require a large amount of energy to produce or maintain. Examples of these green building materials include bamboo, recycled materials, FSC-certified wood, and low-VOC paints or adhesives. Additionally, incorporating energy-efficient technologies such as solar panels or geothermal systems can help reduce energy costs and limit waste. Utilizing natural elements in the design of the building, such as passive cooling and ventilation systems and daylighting, can also help maximize energy efficiency.",
