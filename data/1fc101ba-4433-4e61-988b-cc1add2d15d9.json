  "input": "",
  "output": "A training plan for getting ready for a 5K marathon should be tailored to the individual's fitness level and goals. Generally, a plan should include three types of workouts: 1) endurance runs (long runs at a slower pace); 2) speed runs (shorter runs at a faster pace); and 3) interval runs (alternating faster and slower runs). \n\nThe overall goal should be to gradually increase the frequency, duration and intensity of the runs. This can be achieved by gradually adding more distance each week, increasing the speed, and running hills and stairs. Additionally, strength and mobility exercises such as squats, lunges, and stretches should be included in the plan. Rest days are also important to ensure that the body is able to recover effectively. \n\nBy following a well-structured training plan, anyone should be able to prepare and reach the finish line of a 5K marathon.",
