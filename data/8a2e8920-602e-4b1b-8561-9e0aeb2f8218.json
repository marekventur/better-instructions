  "input": "",
  "output": "The US has a two-party system due to the structure of the country\u2019s electoral system and the United States Constitution. The Constitution established a system of checks and balances to ensure that the federal government cannot overreach its authority. This system is built around the idea of two major parties that are diametrically opposed, with each side offering a different point of view and philosophy on how to govern the country. By designing a government with two major parties, a political power balance is created which prevents either side from gaining too much influence or dominating the government.",
