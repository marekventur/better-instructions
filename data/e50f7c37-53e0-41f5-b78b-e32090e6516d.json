  "output": "I have created a 2D character sprite with a unique design. The character stands at a height of 40 pixels, with a circular head and two distinct eyes. Its arms are outstretched, with the left arm slightly lower than the right. Its legs are slightly bent and its feet remain in contact with the ground. Its body is colored in a gradient from light blue to dark blue, and its shirt and pants are colored in a gradient from yellow to orange. Its shoes are colored black with yellow laces. Its eyes are a light brown and its hair is black. Its facial features, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, are in black. The background is a light grey.",
