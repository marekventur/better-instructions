  "output": "Verse 1: \nIn nature everything is alive, \nFrom the blooming flower's to the humming hive. \nOn its own accord the wind freely blows, \nBringing life and joy where ever it goes. \n\nVerse 2:\nFrom the highest peak to the lowest valley, \nNature can be found in every alley. \nFrom the deepest depth of the oceans floor,\nTo the tallest clouds that soar. \n\nVerse 3: \nNature provides us with hope and dreams,\nFills our lives with joy, laughter and streams. \nGives us shelter from the hot summer sun,\nAnd comfort in knowing it will all be done.\n\nVerse 4: \nNature is generous and never asks for a cost, \nIt's simply here for us to enjoy and not to be lost. \nSo let us appreciate and respect it's beauty and grace,\nAnd take care of it with love to keep it alive in this place.",
