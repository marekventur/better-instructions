  "instruction": "Name three environmental benefits of renewable energy",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The three main environmental benefits of renewable energy include the reduction of noxious emissions, the decreased reliance on exhaustible nonrenewable energy sources, and the reduction in water pollution. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal do not emit pollutants and therefore reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, which emit pollutants. Furthermore, owing to the fact that renewable energy sources are renewable, they also reduce our reliance on exhaustible nonrenewable energy sources such as oil and natural gas. Finally, renewable energy can also help reduce water pollution caused by thermal power plants.",
