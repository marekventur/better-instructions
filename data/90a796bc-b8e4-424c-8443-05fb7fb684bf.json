  "input": "",
  "output": "The legal system is like a complex machine; each part must work together for the machine to function properly. The laws act as the components of the machine, ensuring that all the pieces come together to create a functioning system. Courts represent the engine of the machine, which is fueled by the evidence, arguments, and outcomes of individual cases. Judges then function as the conductor, ensuring that the various components of the machine move in harmony for the best outcome.",
