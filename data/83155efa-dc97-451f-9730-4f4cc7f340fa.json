Take time to identify and process your emotions and don't be afraid to talk to someone you trust if you are feeling overwhelmed or struggling with your mental health. Positive self-care habits such as eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep and exercise, and spending time with family and friends can all help ensure good mental health.",
