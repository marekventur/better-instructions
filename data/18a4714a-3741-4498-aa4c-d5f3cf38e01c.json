  "input": "",
  "output": "Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions requires a multi-faceted approach. The three key strategies are improving energy efficiency, switching to renewable energy sources, and reducing methane emissions. \n\nTo improve energy efficiency, governments and businesses can introduce policies recognizing the importance of energy efficiency. These policies can include regulations requiring buildings and appliances to have higher efficiency ratings, incentives for people to buy energy efficient cars, and legislation to make large-scale energy efficiency improvements. \n\nSwitching to renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro power can reduce our dependence on polluting fossil fuels. To encourage businesses and individuals to switch to renewable energy, governments can introduce tax credits and other incentives.\n\nFinally, reducing methane emissions is important as methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that is even more potent than carbon dioxide. This can be achieved through various mitigation strategies such as reducing waste to landfills, improving livestock management, and encouraging sustainable agricultural practices.",
