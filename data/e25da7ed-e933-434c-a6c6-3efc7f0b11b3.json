  "input": "",
  "output": "Virtualization is a technology that allows a single physical computer to be divided into multiple virtual machines. Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and applications and can be managed independently from the physical computer. This allows greater flexibility in resource usage, enabling multiple applications to be run simultaneously on the same hardware with fewer performance issues and costs. Virtualization also enables easier backup and recovery of applications, as the virtual machines can be quickly cloned or restored in the event of a failure.",
