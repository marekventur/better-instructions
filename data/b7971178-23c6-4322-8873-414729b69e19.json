  "output": "As the days grow colder and shorter\nIn autumn the world turns to nature\nA chill night breeze brings a sense of calm\nTo release the stress, to heal, to balm\n\nThe trees rustle in a gentle breeze\nTruths unspoken and things to appease\nTheir secret language of rustles and whispers\nAs calm as a harbor and life it delivers\n\nMy favorite season of all the year\nAs autumn approaches I'm filled with cheer\nI think of how vibrant the colors will be\nThe love of life and peace deep inside me",
