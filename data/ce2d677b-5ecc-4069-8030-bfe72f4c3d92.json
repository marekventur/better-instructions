  "output": "The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, is a virus that affects the respiratory system, causing symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing. It is believed that the virus attacks the lungs and can lead to lung inflammation, fluid buildup in the lungs and even acute respiratory distress syndrome. The virus can cause severe and life-threatening complications for people with weakened immune systems. It is also believed to be responsible for causing severe cases of pneumonia.
