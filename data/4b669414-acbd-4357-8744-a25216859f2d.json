  "input": "",
  "output": "Recent developments in quantum computing have focused on developing robust and reliable hardware solutions that can process quantum algorithms. Such solutions include quantum annealers, quantum simulators, photonic quantum systems, and quantum-dot based computing. Furthermore, quantum algorithms have been developed to solve problems such as optimization, machine learning, drug discovery, and cryptography that were previously thought to be intractable.",
