Is there anything I can do to help you stay organized moving forward?\"\n\nSarah: \"Yes, I could use some tips on how to better manage my time. Do you have any suggestions?\"\n\nTeacher: \"One way I suggest is to prioritize your tasks and set realistic goals. You should also break up big tasks into smaller pieces, so they don't seem so intimidating.\"\n\nSarah: \"That sounds like a great plan. I'll keep it in mind for next time.\"\n\nTeacher: \"Sounds like a plan. Good luck!\"",
