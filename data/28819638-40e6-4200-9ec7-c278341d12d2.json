  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a robot named Ace. Ace was a special kind of robot - he was designed to perform everyday tasks. Ace was incredible at washing the dishes, folding laundry, and vacuuming the carpets. He could even put together complex meals for his owners. In the evenings, he was programmed to read bedtime stories to the children in exchange for a hug. Ace was always happy to lend a helping hand and his owners loved him dearly. He was the best robotic helper anyone could ask for!",
