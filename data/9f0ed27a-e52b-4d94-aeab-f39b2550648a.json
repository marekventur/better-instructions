  "input": "",
  "output": "Outsourcing is the practice of hiring outside firms or individuals to handle specific tasks or services. By outsourcing, companies can achieve a number of benefits, including increased efficiency, greater flexibility, and cost savings. Outsourcing can help companies focus more time and resources on their core business activities and gain access to specialized skills and expertise. In addition, outsourcing can help companies expand into new markets more quickly and easily, and help free up internal resources that would otherwise have to be used for mundane tasks. Ultimately, outsourcing can help companies be more successful and move closer to achieving their goals.",
