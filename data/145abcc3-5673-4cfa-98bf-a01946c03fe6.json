  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Leveraging large-scale datasets: A GPT-3 language model is able to generate novel content from existing datasets without being exposed to those datasets.\n2. Automatically generating text: GPT-3 language models can generate coherent text from a given prompt, without requiring manual input.\n3. Capturing long-term dependencies: GPT-3 language models are able to capture and use knowledge from the context surrounding a given text to complete a task.\n4. Transfer learning capabilities: GPT-3 language models can transfer knowledge across tasks and fields, allowing an AI system to learn new tasks more easily.\n5. Improved efficiency: GPT-3 language models can be trained more efficiently than previous versions, reducing both training and inference time.",
