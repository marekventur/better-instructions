  "input": "The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye.",
  "output": "The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye are both novels written during the twentieth century. They both explore similar themes of disillusionment and coming of age in the modern era. The Great Gatsby is a more romantic novel set in the 1920s and focuses on themes of society\u2019s moral decay and the American Dream. The Catcher in the Rye is set in the 1950s and focuses on themes of alienation, the abandon of childhood innocence, and a sense of losing one\u2019s identity in the modern world. Despite their similarities, these two books have vastly different tones and characters.",
