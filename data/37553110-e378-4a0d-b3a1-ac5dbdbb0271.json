It employs a microservices architecture to break down its application into small components that can be scaled independently. It utilizes technologies that allow for horizontal and vertical scalability, such as containers and Kubernetes. Additionally, it uses monitoring and logging solutions to keep track of user activities, such as New Relic and Datadog. Furthermore, the application is optimized and designed to handle large influx of traffic and data.",
