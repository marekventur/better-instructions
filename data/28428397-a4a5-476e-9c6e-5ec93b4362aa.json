  "output": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of Machine Learning in which an agent interacts with an environment by taking actions and observing consequences of those actions, and using the feedback to learn. The agent learns a policy that maximizes its reward by selecting the best action based on the current state of the environment. The agent works iteratively by exploring and exploiting its environment, so that it can eventually maximize its long-term reward.",
