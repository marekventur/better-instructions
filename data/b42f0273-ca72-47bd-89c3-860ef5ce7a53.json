  "input": "",
  "output": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the travel industry. Travel restrictions, health protocols, and safety concerns have made it difficult for travelers to plan trips and for businesses to operate on any kind of normal level. Airlines, hotels, and other hospitality industry providers have been severely affected by lost revenues due to cancelled trips and a lack of people travelling. Even with the eventual rollout of vaccines, it is highly likely that the travel industry will never return to its pre-pandemic levels of activity.",
