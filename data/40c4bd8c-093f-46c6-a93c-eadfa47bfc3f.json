  "output": "The T-Rex was the most famous of the Tyrannosauridae family and the most fearsome of all the dinosaurs. It lived during the Cretaceous period and roamed in what is now western North America. The T-Rex had strong hind legs, was 17 meters long, and weighed over 5 tons. It had a powerful jaw with sharp, serrated teeth that could pulverize prey. With a mouth full of serrated, four-inch long teeth, and an estimated bite force of over four tons, this predator was the undisputed champion of its time.",
