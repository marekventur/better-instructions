  "input": "",
  "output": "I propose a data structure to store information about a user's medical condition. This data structure will consist of two parts: \n\n1. A hash table which will store the user's unique identifier and the associated medical condition. The hash table will use the user's unique identifier as a key and the medical condition as the value. \n\n2. A linked list which will store the user's medical records. Each item in the list will contain the patient's name, medical condition, medications, and other relevant information. The linked list will be connected to the hash table and will allow for easy retrieval of the patient's medical records.",
