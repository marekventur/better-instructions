  "input": "",
  "output": "5G technology will allow for faster communication speeds, lower latency, and improved reliability for the Internet of Things (IoT). It will enable IoT devices to communicate with each other more quickly and efficiently, leading to improved performance and increased scalability of IoT applications. With the increased speeds and capacity of 5G networks, the number of connected devices that can be supported by a single network is expected to grow significantly, with the potential for up to one million devices per square kilometer.",
