  "output": "One quantum computing algorithm that has been used in recent years is Grover's algorithm. It is a quantum algorithm used to speed up database searches, especially when the database is too large to search using classical computing. The algorithm uses quantum entanglement to reduce the number of operations needed to search through the database.",
