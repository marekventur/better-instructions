  "input": "",
  "output": "One possible solution to global warming is to invest in renewable energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal power. Governments should offer incentives for people to switch to renewable energy sources as well as research and development funding for new technology. Additionally, we should look into ways to create more efficient energy storage and transmission systems. Finally, we should focus on reducing our energy consumption and seek out ways to promote urban sustainability.",
