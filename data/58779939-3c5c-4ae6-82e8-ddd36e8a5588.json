  "input": "Technology X: E-commerce \nTechnology Y: Brick and Mortar",
  "output": "Ecommerce and brick and mortar businesses have different advantages and disadvantages. With ecommerce, customers can shop from anywhere and the business does not have to maintain a physical location. The costs associated with running an ecommerce business tend to be significantly lower than those of brick and mortar businesses. However, brick and mortar businesses have the advantage of creating an in-person relationship with customers, and often can offer a more personal experience. Brick and mortar stores also benefit from location-specific advantages such as foot traffic, while ecommerce businesses may struggle to reach customers without an online presence.",
