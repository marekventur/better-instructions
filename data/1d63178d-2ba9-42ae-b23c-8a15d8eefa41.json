  "input": "",
  "output": "Fish have several adaptations that help them survive in the ocean. These include specialized fins for swimming and maneuvering in the water; specially adapted eyes for seeing in low light or murky water; and, in some species, a thicker skin and scales to protect against predators and the effects of pressure changes. Additionally, some fish have specialized organs which allow them to breathe oxygen from the water, while some types of fish can extract oxygen directly from the water through their skin.",
