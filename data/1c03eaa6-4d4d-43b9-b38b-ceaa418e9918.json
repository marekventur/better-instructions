  "instruction": "Generate a musical piece to reflect a specific emotion.",
  "input": "Emotion: Eager anticipation",
  "output": "The musical piece starts out with a quick, energetic beat and grows increasingly faster. It conveys a feeling of eager anticipation and excitement, as if something amazing and unexpected is about to happen. The rhythm remains tight and intense and builds with multiple layers of sound as the piece progresses. As it reaches its climax, the music slows down and brings a wave of calm energy.",
