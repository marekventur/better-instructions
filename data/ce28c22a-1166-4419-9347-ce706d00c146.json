  "input": "Price of Product X: $10, Price of Product Y: $5",
  "output": "Given the unit price of $10 for Product X and $5 for Product Y, according to the Mean-Variance Optimization model, the investor should allocate their capital in such a way that the mean of returns is maximized and the variance is minimized. Therefore, the optimal allocation is 0.67 for Product X and 0.33 for Product Y.",
