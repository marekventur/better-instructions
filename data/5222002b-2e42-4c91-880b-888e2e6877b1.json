  "instruction": "Describe the current economic situation of the given country.",
  "input": "Japan",
  "output": "Japan's economy is currently in a strong position, with a GDP growth forecasted to remain positive for 2021. The economy is being supported by a host of extenuating circumstances, including Covid-19 stimulus packages and a weaker Japanese Yen, as well as a large investment by multinationals into the country. The country's current account balance is also positive, and is projected to remain so through the year. Private consumption is also on the rise, due to an increasingly profitable business environment and an accommodating labour market, providing increased job security. Despite this, Japan's economy continues to face a number of challenges, such as a declining population, the rising cost of energy, and the ongoing fragmentation of global supply chains. Despite this, policies in place are encouraging economic growth, providing a strong basis for the country's future outlook.",
