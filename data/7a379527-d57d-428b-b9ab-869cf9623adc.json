  "output": "The moon glows in the night sky,\nIlluminating the dark like a radiant light.\nIt guides the stars to shine so bright,\nAs the night owl spreads its wings and takes flight.\n\nThe moon watches over us all,\nSilently as we go through life.\nIn times of distress its presence we call,\nTo offer us peace and solace amidst strife. \n\nOur eyes will never tire of its gentle glow,\nAs it ends one night and starts a new day.\nThe beauty of the moon will always show,\nAs it floats in the sky and never fades away.",
