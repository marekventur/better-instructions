  "output": "Validation data is used to assess the accuracy, robustness, and performance of machine learning models. It is a subset of the training data or a separate data set that is used to test and validate the model. Validation data is used to tune the hyperparameters of a model and find better solutions by comparing the results from different models. Additionally, it can detect any bias or overfitting issues in the model and help to improve its accuracy. By relying on validation data, one can be sure that the model has been properly trained and is ready for deployment.",
