  "input": "",
  "output": "If the protagonists in Romeo and Juliet had been more decisive, they could have resolved their feuding families\u2019 differences earlier, avoided the unfortunate and unnecessary tragedy, and lived happily ever after. Alternatively, if they had been more aware of their limitations and less starry-eyed, they could have accepted their fate and taken a more humble path, thereby eliminating their suffering and reducing the magnitude of their ill-fated decisions.",
