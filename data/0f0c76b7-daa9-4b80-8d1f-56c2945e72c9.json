  "output": "The hydrologic cycle is the cyclical process through which water moves through the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and land. It starts when water from oceans, glaciers, and rivers is evaporated into the atmosphere as water vapor. This vaporized water then rises and forms clouds, then condenses and forms precipitation, which can fall as rain, snow, or hail. Water then falls to the Earth, where it can either evaporate again into the atmosphere or be carried down into waterways and streams. This water can then flow back into the oceans completing the cycle. \n// end of output //",
