  "output": "Saving for retirement is a vital part of your financial wellness. Retirement planning is essential if you want to maintain your current lifestyle as you transition into retirement. Retirement savings will provide you with reliable income to cover your daily expenses, medical costs, and other expenditure. \n\nWithout retirement savings, you may need to rely on Social Security or other government options for income, which may not provide you with enough money to take care of all your needs. Additionally, planning for retirement allows you to take advantage of unique savings and tax benefits which can give you greater financial security. Saving for retirement is an important step to ensure you have the financial security you need when you retire.",
