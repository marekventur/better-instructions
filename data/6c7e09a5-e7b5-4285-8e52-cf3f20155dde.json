  "output": "Tommy was a small Jack Russell Terrier who had lots of energy and loved to explore the world. During one of his outings, Tommy wandered away and was lost. His family searched all around the neighborhood calling out his name, but they couldn't find him. After searching for days and nights, they still couldn't find him. But, one day, when they least expected it, a kind stranger came to the door and gave them the happiest surprise ever - Tommy was safe and sound!",
