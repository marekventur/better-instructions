  "input": "",
  "output": "Program for recognizing facial expressions:\n1. The program should first capture an image of the person's face from a camera or similar device. \n2. The image should be processed by the program to identify and extract facial features, such as eyes, nose, mouth, and facial contours.\n3. A set of facial recognition algorithms should be used to match the extracted features to a list of facial expressions.\n4. A \u201cconfidence score\u201d should be calculated and compared with a pre-defined confidence threshold.\n5. If the score meets the threshold, the program should recognize the facial expression. \n6. The detected facial expression should be recorded, along with the relevant data such as timestamp, context, and device information.",
