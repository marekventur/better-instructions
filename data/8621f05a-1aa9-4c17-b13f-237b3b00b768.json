  "input": "",
  "output": "The polynomial time complexity of an algorithm is important because it allows us to compare algorithms based on the time it takes for them to run. Algorithms with a lower polynomial time complexity can usually be completed faster, which makes them more efficient. Having an understanding of the time complexity of an algorithm allows us to better optimize our code and make sure it will run in an acceptable amount of time.",
