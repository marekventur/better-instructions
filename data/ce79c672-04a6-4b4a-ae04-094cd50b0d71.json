  "input": "",
  "output": "Programming languages are used for writing programs with instructions that the computer can understand and execute. Scripting languages are small sub-languages or mini-programs used to control larger programs. They allow the user to control details of the user interface and can sometimes apply behavioral changes to different functions. For example, one might use a scripting language to easily change the font size and style on a web page without having to go back and reprogram the entire page.",
