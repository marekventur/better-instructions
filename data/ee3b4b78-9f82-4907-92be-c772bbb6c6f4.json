  "output": "The game is called Catch the Ant. The goal of the game is for each player to catch as many ants as they can in a certain amount of time. Each player begins with three \"ants\" (which could be circles or whatever else) and each of the ants is marked with a unique color. On a player\u2019s turn, they throw a \"net\" (which could be a loop made of yarn or some other material) at a certain spot on the playing field. If they catch any of the other player\u2019s ants, they get to keep it. At the end of the game, the player with the most ants at the end of the game wins.",
