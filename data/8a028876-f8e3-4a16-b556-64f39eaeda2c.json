Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) round cake pan or 9x5 inch (23x13 cm) loaf pan with butter and line it with parchment paper.\n\nStep 2: In a medium bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt until combined.\n\nStep 3: In a large bowl whisk together the melted butter and sugar until combined. Add the eggs one at a time and mix until everything is evenly combined. Beat in the vanilla extract.\n\nStep 4: Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and whisk until all the ingredients are evenly mixed. Then fold in the chopped nuts, if using.\n\nStep 5: Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 50 minutes for a round cake or about 1 hour for a loaf cake, until the top is golden-brown and a cake tester inserted in the centre comes out clean.\n\nStep 6: When done, let the cake cool in the pan for an hour or two before removing it and transferring to a cutting board. Cut it in slices and enjoy!",
