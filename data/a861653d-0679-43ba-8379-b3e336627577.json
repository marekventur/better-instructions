  "instruction": "Explain the concept of genomic imprinting.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Genomic imprinting is a process in which certain genes are expressed differently depending on which parent they are inherited from. This can cause certain physical characteristics or traits to be expressed only if passed down from the father or mother. Imprints are created when chemicals attach to the gene, stifling or amplifying the gene's expression.",
