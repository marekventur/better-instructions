  "input": "",
  "output": "One potential consequence of global warming is rising sea levels, which can lead to the displacement of coastal populations, severe flooding, and damage to low-lying agriculture, infrastructure, and habitats. It can also result in extended periods of drought and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and heat waves, which can cause extensive property damage, disruption of food supply and water availability, and loss of life.",
