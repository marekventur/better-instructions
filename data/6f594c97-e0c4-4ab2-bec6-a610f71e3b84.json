  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Start with a flat surface and a medium soft pencil.\n2. Draw two concentric circles in the middle and give the rings subtle bumps and curves.\n3. Draw a triangle on each end of the larger circle.\n4. Connect the triangles with curved lines.\n5. Add four thin points around the circle and create a loose curved line around the ring to add texture and detail to the snowflake.\n6. Finally, add a curved line to the triangle points and round the corners.",
