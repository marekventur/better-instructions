  "input": "",
  "output": "A vector quantity is one that has both a magnitude and a direction associated with it, such as velocity or momentum. A scalar quantity is one that has only magnitude, such as temperature or mass. Vector quantities can be added and subtracted from each other, while scalar quantities can only be added or subtracted from a constant value.",
