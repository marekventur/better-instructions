  "output": "Kangaroos and koalas are both marsupials from the same superfamily, but they have some significant differences. Kangaroos are much larger and are well-known for their ability to jump, while koalas are much smaller and arboreal. Kangaroos are also quite active during the day and sleep in the afternoon, but koalas are nocturnal and sleep for most of the day.",
