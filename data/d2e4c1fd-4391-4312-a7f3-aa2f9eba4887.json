  "instruction": "Describe the working of a spin-off company to a 4th grader.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A spin-off company is like a new company that starts from something that already exists. It starts because the company, or part of it, has a different idea or goal than the original company. So the spin-off company goes off on its own and becomes its own thing. For example, a toy company might have a section that makes dolls, so they could make a spin-off company that only makes dolls. That way the dolls have their own company and do things the way they want to.",
