  "input": "Histogram 1: \n\n![alt text](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/histogram-example.svg \"Histogram 1\")\n\nHistogram 2:\n\n![alt text](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/histogram-example2.svg \"Histogram 2\")",
  "output": "The two histograms show different distributions of data. Histogram 1 has a more uniform distribution with more values spread throughout the range, while Histogram 2 shows more extreme values bunched at the left side of the range. Furthermore, Histogram 1 has a higher peak at the center compared to Histogram 2. Therefore, Histogram 1 has a higher central tendency compared to Histogram 2.",
