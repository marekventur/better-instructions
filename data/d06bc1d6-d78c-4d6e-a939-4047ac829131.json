  "input": "",
  "output": "Lemons and limes are both small citrus fruits, but there are several key differences between them. Lemons are bright yellow and often have a more sour taste than limes. Limes are typically green and have a more tart flavor. The peel of a lemon is thicker than that of a lime, and the juice of a lemon is much more acidic. Lemons also tend to be larger than limes.",
