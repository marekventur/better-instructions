  "input": "",
  "output": "A GPT-2 model can be used to generate text by taking a prompt as input and then predicting the next word or words that should follow in the text. The model can be trained on large datasets of text and uses a technique known as self-attention, which takes into account the entire context of a sentence before predicting the next word. The text it generates is then evaluated and refined to produce more natural-sounding text which can be used for applications such as autocompletion, summarization, creative writing, and conversation.",
