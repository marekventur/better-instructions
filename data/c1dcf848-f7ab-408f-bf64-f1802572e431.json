  "input": "",
  "output": "The three steps involved in the water cycle are evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. In the evaporation step, water from the earth\u2019s surface is heated by the sun, and turns into vapor that rises into the atmosphere. Condensation occurs when the vapor cools and forms clouds. In the precipitation step, the clouds release the water in the form of rain, hail, sleet, or snow, which eventually falls back to the earth\u2019s surface.",
