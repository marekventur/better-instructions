  "output": "One solution to the ethical issue of advertising to children is to put in place strict regulations that forbid child-targeted advertising, including explicit prohibitions on material which could be seen as appealing to children, or which promotes unhealthy or unsafe practices. It could also be beneficial to provide education and awareness materials which teach children about appropriate responses to advertising.",
