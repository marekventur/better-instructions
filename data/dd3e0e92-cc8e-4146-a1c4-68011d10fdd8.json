  "input": "",
  "output": "There are several ways to combat air pollution. One way is by reducing the amount of emissions from transportation and factories through the use of low-emission vehicles, cleaner fuels, and better production technologies. Additionally, the use of renewable energy sources such as wind or solar energy can reduce dependence on fossil fuels, resulting in fewer greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions. Planting trees can also help absorb some air pollutants, while introducing the use of air-purifying machines in populated areas can have a significant impact on air quality.",
