  "input": "",
  "output": "Apples and oranges are both popular fruits, but they differ in several ways. Apples are typically round and firm, with a sweet-tart flavor. Oranges are typically spherical, juicy, and sweet. Apples come in a range of colors from green to red, while oranges are mostly orange but can be found in some varieties with yellow or green skin. Apples are served fresh, but oranges are generally juiced. Apples can be baked, stewed, and used in many recipes, while oranges are a popular ingredient in salads, marmalades, and juices. Apples contain more vitamin C than oranges, but oranges are a great source of dietary fiber.",
