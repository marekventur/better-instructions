  "instruction": "Pick two analogies from the given text and explain them",
  "input": "An analogy compares one thing to another in order to help explain it. It\u2019s like throwing a pebble in a pond: the ripples of the water show how something small can affect a much larger area.",
  "output": "The first analogy compares something to throwing a pebble in a pond. This analogy illustrates how a small action can have consequences that extend far beyond the initial action. The second analogy compares something to ripples in water. This analogy illustrates how an event can cause further and lasting effects that extend beyond the initial event.",
