  "output": "One type of cloud is a cumulus cloud, which is a large, fluffy, white cloud made of water droplets. Cumulus clouds form due to the warm air rising and cooling as it reaches higher altitudes. As the air then cools, the water droplets in the air condense, leading to the formation of cumulus clouds.",
