  "output": "Yoga is a great form of exercise for those looking to relax and get fit. A good beginner yoga class should focus on the basics and help build a strong foundation. To get the most out of a beginner class, seek out an instructor who is patient, attentive and has experience teaching students at all levels. Look for a class that works with students at a comfortable pace, explores different poses and gives time for rest and relaxation. Once the basics are established, a gradual increase in intensity and difficulty is ideal to help build strength, flexibility and stamina.",
