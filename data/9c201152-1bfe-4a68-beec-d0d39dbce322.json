  "output": "The joy of summer sparkles in the air  \nAs laughter drifts across the sunny meadow  \nThe warmth of the sun, laughter filling the air  \nMakes a heart feel glad, with emotions to follow \n\nAn old oak tree stands tall, a majestic sight  \nSpreading its branches out like a gentle embrace  \nRelaxing in its shade, birds singing in flight  \nLetting us know joy and love never out of place\n\nThe bubbling laughter of a child, bursting at the seams  \nThe sweet smell of BBQ in the evening breeze  \nLightning bugs twinkling out in the night's gleam  \nA reminder that joy can be found amongst the trees\n\nYearning for that sultry summer joy  \nThat only the season can bring our way  \nOur hearts filled with its warmth and joy  \nWith each and every passing day.",
