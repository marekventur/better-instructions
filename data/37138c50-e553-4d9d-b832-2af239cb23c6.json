  "input": "",
  "output": "One solution to reducing air pollution is increasing public awareness of the issue. Educating people about the sources and effects of air pollution, as well as the solutions to reduce it, will encourage people to take action. Governments can lead such initiatives by organizing educational campaigns and strengthening environmental regulations. \n\nAnother way to reduce air pollution is to switch to cleaner energy sources. This includes using renewable energy sources, such as solar power and wind energy, instead of fossil fuels. This will reduce the emission of hazardous pollutants, such as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, from energy production.",
