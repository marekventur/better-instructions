Before boarding and preparing to take off, make sure you have read all the safety regulations provided with your ticket and familiarized yourself with them. During the flight, observe all instructions given by the flight attendants and listen to announcements given over the intercom system. Make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened the entire time. Do not move around the cabin while the plane is taking off or landing, and pay attention to any noise coming from the engines. In case of an emergency, follow the crew\u2019s instructions and never leave the aircraft unless told to do so. Being informed and prepared can ensure a safe and successful flight for everyone!",
