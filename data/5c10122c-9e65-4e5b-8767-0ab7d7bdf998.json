  "input": "",
  "output": "One effective strategy for time management is to prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency. Start by making a list of all the tasks you need to do, then prioritize them into three categories: Important/Urgent, Important/Not Urgent, and Not Important/Not Urgent. Focus on the tasks that are Important/Urgent first, followed by the Important/Not Urgent tasks, then the Not Important/Not Urgent tasks. Additionally, break big tasks down into smaller ones, to make them easier to manage and complete. Finally, set reasonable deadlines for yourself and use reminders or a calendar to ensure that tasks get completed on time.",
