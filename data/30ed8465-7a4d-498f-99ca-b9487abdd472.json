  "input": "",
  "output": "The most common causes of climate change include:\n- Increase in greenhouse gases due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and livestock rearing.\n- Aerosol emissions from human activities such as vehicle exhaust, and industrial emissions. \n- Methane emissions from agricultural activities such as rice cultivation, and livestock farming.\n- Ozone depletion caused by chlorofluorocarbons and other aerosols.\n- Deforestation and habitat destruction, leading to reduced levels of CO2 absorption by vegetation and soils.\n- Urban heat islands, caused by heat generated by built infrastructure.\n- Land-use changes such as dam building and large-scale irrigation.\n- Solar activity, which affects both temperatures and cloud cover. \n- Volcanic activity, which affects temperatures and climate patterns. \n- Natural variation in ocean currents, sea surface temperatures, and El Ni\u00f1o events.",
