  "output": "A typical day in the life of an NBA player begins with waking up in the morning and heading to the practice gym. There they will work on their skills, health and conditioning with their coaches and teammates. After practice they might attend team meetings, review game footage, and consult with medical staff. The afternoon is likely spent recovering with rest and recovery, and often includes meetings with the media. The evening is typically spent attending and participating in a game, ranging from pre game warm ups, game strategizing and intros, to post game celebrations or recuperation. Outside of the games, NBA players also take part in charitable works and other league related events like clinics and camps.",
