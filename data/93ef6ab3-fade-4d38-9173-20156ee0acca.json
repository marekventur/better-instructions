  "output": "I designed a 3D game level by using various 3D modeling software. I created a large open area with a grassy terrain and various obstacles. I added trees, rocks, and bodies of water to provide more visual interest and create different elevations. I also added buildings and other structures to provide additional exploration opportunities and objectives. Finally, I added enemies and NPCs to give the level some challenge and provide an immersive experience.",
