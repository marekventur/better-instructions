  "input": "",
  "output": "Spiral galaxies have a flat, pinwhell-like structure made up of stars, dust, and gas, which is what gives them their name. They also possess a central bulge, which contains a greater density of stars towards the center. Elliptical galaxies are much less structured, being elliptically shaped and resembling a basketball in appearance. They do not have a spiral-like structure, and do not contain a central bulge.",
