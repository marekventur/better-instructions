  "output": "A linear regression model is a type of machine learning model that can be used to predict or estimate the value of a continuous numerical variable from a set of input variables. In this model, a line is fitted to a set of data points such that the sum of the squared distance of the data points from the line is minimized. This line of best fit can then be used to estimate the value of the output variable based on the values of the input variables.",
