  "input": "",
  "output": "The prime factorization of 2800 is 2\u00b2 x 2\u00b2 x 5\u00b2 x 7. This can be written as 2800 = 2\u2074 x 5\u00b2 x 7.  Each of the prime factors' exponents indicates the number of times that number appears in the factorization. In this case, 2\u00b2 appears 4 times, 5\u00b2 appears 2 times, and 7 appears 1 time. The product of the factors gives 2800.",
