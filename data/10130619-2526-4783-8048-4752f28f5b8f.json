  "input": "",
  "output": "Machine learning models can be deployed in a variety of ways. The most common way is to deploy a trained model as a web service, which allows users to interact with the model via a web interface. Another option is to deploy the model as a mobile application, which allows users to receive the results of the model on their mobile devices. Additionally, models can be deployed into production systems, such as embedded systems or industrial robots, where they are used in real-world applications. Finally, machine learning models can also be deployed to the cloud, allowing users to run them as a service, or as part of a larger distributed computing environment.",
