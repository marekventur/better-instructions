  "output": "A suitable wedding gift could be a poem written by the famous English Poet William Wordsworth called \"My Heart Leaps Up\". It expresses the beauty of life and nature and how the narrator still remembers his childhood joys and excitements. Here is an excerpt:\n\n\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\nA rainbow in the sky:\nSo was it when my life began;\nSo is it now I am a man;\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\nOr let me die!\nThe Child is father of the Man;\nAnd I could wish my days to be\nBound each to each by natural piety.",
