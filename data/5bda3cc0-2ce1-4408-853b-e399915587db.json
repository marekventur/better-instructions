  "output": "The rule of law is the foundation of modern legal systems and societies. It is a concept that holds that any persons, including government leaders, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated and widely known. In other words, the rule of law states that all people must adhere to the law and no one is exempt. It requires that laws be established and implemented impartially, and it protects human rights as guaranteed by law. The rule of law also stresses that laws must be certain and clear and consistent with a general application of justice. It also calls for a fair, consistent method of enforcement.",
