  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial intelligence can be used for helping the disabled in a variety of ways. For example, AI can be used to enable them to more efficiently complete tasks with technology that can understand their needs and activity levels. AI-based tools, such as speech and gesture recognition software, can be used by the disabled to access and interact with devices, applications, and websites, while applications powered by AI technologies, such as facial recognition and natural language processing, can be used to detect abnormalities in movement or speech patterns, or provide guidance to the disabled with adaptive navigation and automation. AI can also be used to develop applications to detect objects in the environment, predict trajectories and outcomes, recognizing facial and emotional expressions, and the generation of sign language translations, aiding those with hearing or sight impairments. AI can also be used for complex tasks such as modeling disease and disability, as well as predicting mobility needs of the disabled in order to provide personalized and adaptive support.",
