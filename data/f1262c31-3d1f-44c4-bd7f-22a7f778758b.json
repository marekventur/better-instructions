  "output": "I recently stayed at the Bellagio in Las Vegas and it was a great experience. The rooms were luxurious and had all the amenities you could want for a comfortable stay. The staff went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of and the pool area was pristine. The location is also great because it's walking distance from some of the best casinos and restaurants in Vegas. Highly recommend!",
