  "input": "",
  "output": "Submitting work late can have serious consequences depending on the severity of the case. A student may be subject to a range of penalties, including but not limited to: loss of credit for the assignment, reduced grade for course, extra assignments or tests given as punishment, being placed on academic probation, or even suspension from school. The desired outcome should be to help the student learn the importance of timeliness while providing a consistent and fair punishment when the rules are not followed.",
