  "input": "",
  "output": "When a hurricane forms, the warm ocean waters begin to create areas of low pressure in the atmosphere. This causes wind to spin around the storm, forming thunderstorms and eventually a hurricane. The warm, moist air rises up and creates powerful, damaging winds that spiral around the storm. Hurricanes can cause immense destruction, including flooding, strong winds, and large waves.",
