  "output": "Planning a park picnic can be a fun and enjoyable experience. Firstly, decide on a location such as a park or a beach. Next, gather food supplies - think sandwich, drinks, snacks and other things to make the picnic more enjoyable. Also, remember to bring the necessary items such as a picnic blanket, chairs and plates. Once the picnic is finished, be sure to clean up after yourselves - throw away any rubbish which have accumulated, and leave the area as it was before. Lastly, enjoy your park picnic and take lots of photos to remember the special day.",
