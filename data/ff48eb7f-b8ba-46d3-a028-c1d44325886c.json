  "input": "",
  "output": "Indoor air quality can be improved by taking several measures. First, controlling the sources of pollutants indoors is key. This includes reducing the use of products such as aerosol sprays, cleaning products, and pesticides. It is also important to ensure proper ventilation and circulation of air to reduce concentration of pollutants in the home. Furthermore, installing an air purifier or air filter can help to capture pollutants in the air and make the air in the home cleaner. Additionally, it is important to monitor levels of humidity and make sure the air is not too dry or too humid. Finally, regularly vacuuming and dusting can help to reduce the presence of allergens like dust mites and pet dander in the air.",
