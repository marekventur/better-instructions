  "input": "",
  "output": "An example of a machine learning algorithm is a support vector machine (SVM). Support vector machines are supervised learning algorithms that are used for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm aims to build a model that can accurately predict the class of a given data point by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the data points into different classes. It is a powerful algorithm with strong mathematical foundations and is used in many applications such as face recognition and natural language processing.",
