  "output": "Rewarding employees for their hard work is an important way to show appreciation and foster a positive workplace environment. One way to reward employees is to provide bonuses based on performance, such as larger bonuses for exceptional work or performance that exceeds expectations. Other rewards can include public recognition, extra time off, financial incentives, and social outings. Additionally, offering employees the opportunity to advance within the organization by providing internal promotions or job reassignment is a great way to reward them for their hard work and dedication.",
