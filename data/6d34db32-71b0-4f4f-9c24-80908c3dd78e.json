  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary difference between an independent contractor and an employee is the amount of control that a company has over the individual. Employees are under the control of the company\u2014the company sets the hours to be worked and the tasks to be done. Employees are also entitled to benefit packages, such as health insurance, workers\u2019 compensation, and paid vacations. An independent contractor, however, is a self-employed worker who is hired to do specific projects on an individual basis. They are not entitled to any benefits, and they have full control over their own schedule and workload. They work under a contract, and they will not necessarily have any long-term relationship with the company they are working for.",
