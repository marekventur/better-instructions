  "instruction": "Describe a protagonist of a dystopian novel.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The protagonist of a dystopian novel is often an average person who is forced to make tough choices and fight for their survival. They typically come from a disadvantaged background, and are either victims or rebels against a corrupt system or government. They struggle against impossible odds or use their intelligence or determination to unravel the mystery of their dystopian world. They often have to struggle with moral dilemmas in order to survive and may or may not succeed in the end. Protagonists of dystopian novels often serve as symbols of hope and courage in the face of adversity. They can be flawed characters or paragons of virtue, but they always reflect on the struggles of real people in stressful and oppressive situations.",
