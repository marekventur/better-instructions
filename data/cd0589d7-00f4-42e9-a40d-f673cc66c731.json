  "instruction": "Design an algorithm that prints the first n prime numbers.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm should loop through every number from 2 to n, checking each number to see if it is divisible by any number between 2 and that number. If that number is not divisible by any number, it is a prime number and should be printed. The loop should continue until n prime numbers have been printed.",
