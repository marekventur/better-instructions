  "instruction": "Describe the steps needed to solve this system of equations.",
  "input": "x + 4y = 7\n5x + 2y = 7",
  "output": "To solve this system of equations, first subtract 4y from both sides of the first equation to obtain x = -4y + 7. Then substitute this into the second equation and solve for y. Finally, substitute the result for y back into either of the original equations to obtain the value of x.",
