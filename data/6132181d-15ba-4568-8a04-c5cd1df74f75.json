  "output": "An algorithm for combining two strings can be designed as follows: \n\n1. Create a new empty string.\n2. Iterate through both strings and add each character to the new string. \n3. When one string fully runs out of characters, add the remaining characters from the other string to the end of the new string. \n4. Return the newly constructed string.",
