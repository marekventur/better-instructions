  "input": "",
  "output": "Advantages of using a hybrid cloud system include: scalability, flexibility and cost savings. With a hybrid cloud system, organizations can dependably scale up or down on a short-term basis. It also allows organizations to utilize private and/or public clouds separately, as needed, depending on the application and workload. Additionally, hybrid cloud systems give organizations the ability to harness cost efficiencies by distributing compute resources across multiple providers. \n\nDisadvantages of using a hybrid cloud system include the potential for increased complexity, higher costs than private or public cloud solutions, and security and privacy concerns. Hybrid cloud systems need a consistent set of policies and procedures to ensure functionality and performance across all cloud systems. Additionally, if the private cloud vendor does not offer the best pricing, then the overall costs associated with a hybrid cloud system could climb. Finally, hybrid cloud systems require additional security and privacy controls to manage data being shared across multiple cloud services.",
