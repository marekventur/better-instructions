  "input": "",
  "output": "The origin of the Internet began in the late 1960s as a project sponsored by the US Department of Defense to create a computer network that could withstand a nuclear attack. This project eventually developed into a network of computers, which allowed for the sharing of information, and in 1985 the first \u201cInternet\u201d was created. The Internet then began to grow as consumers were able to connect via service providers and dial-up connections, slowly introducing different protocols, browsers, and websites. By the mid-1990s the Internet had become a popular medium for entertainment, communication, and business, which lead to the development of search engines, social media sites, and other applications, furthering the growth of the Internet and its services.",
