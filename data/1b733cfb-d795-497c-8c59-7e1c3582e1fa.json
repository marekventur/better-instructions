  "input": "",
  "output": "Affirmative action is a policy used by governments and organizations to counteract historical discrimination of certain groups by providing equal opportunities to those groups. It works by giving preference or special consideration to groups that are underrepresented or disadvantaged in a certain area, usually resulting in higher acquisition rates for these groups. Examples include preferences for qualified women, people of color, and members of other historically excluded groups. Affirmative action helps to combat systemic barriers and discrimination and allows organizations to embrace diversity.",
