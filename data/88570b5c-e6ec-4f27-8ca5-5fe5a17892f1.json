  "input": "",
  "output": "The Drake Equation is an equation developed by radio astronomer Dr. Frank Drake in 1961. It is used to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation takes into account the factors of the rate of star formation, the average rate of planets that can potentially host life, the fraction of stars with planets that actually have life, the number of planets that develop intelligent life, the fraction of which would develop interstellar communication, and the length of time over which they could communicate. The equation is used to estimate the number of both extinct and extant extraterrestrial civilizations.",
