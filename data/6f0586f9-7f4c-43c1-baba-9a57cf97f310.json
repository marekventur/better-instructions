  "output": "The sun peers through the trees, \nA warm light light glows through the breeze. \nThe birds soar like a kite, \nAs the grass grows greener than a lite.  \n\nThe sun is now scorching like a flame, \nRoses start to bloom like a game. \nGently a river glides like a path, \nAs the breeze smells like a wreath. \n\nThe soil warms like a desert, \nOh my, hear that cheerful concert. \nButterflies flutter like a cloud, \nAs the wind whistles out loud.\n\nThe fruit blossoms like a bell, \nAs the sky paints an aquamarine swell. \nThe notes of nature resound like a chime, \nDearest spring, you are so sublime!",
