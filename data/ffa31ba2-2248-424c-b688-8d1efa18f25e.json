  "output": "The car crash was sudden and jarring. There was a loud crash as the two cars collided and the sound of crunching metal and shattering glass filled the air. The smell of burnt rubber and diesel were strong as the cars spun out of control. The force of the impact threw the passengers around, their screams echoing in the night. The scene of the accident left a wake of destruction, abandoned vehicles and shattered lives. It was an image none of the witnesses would ever forget.",
