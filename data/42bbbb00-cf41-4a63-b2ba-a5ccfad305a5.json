  "input": "Educational Settings: an elementary school classroom and a college seminar.",
  "output": "In an elementary school classroom, the teacher-student relationship is usually one of high structure and guidance, with the teacher acting as an instructor and leader. The teacher is often expected to be an authority figure, delivering clear curricular expectations and disciplinary commands. \n\nIn a college seminar setting, the teacher-student relationship is usually one that is collaborative and engaging. The teacher acts more as a facilitator, guiding the conversation but allowing for more independent exploration. The student is expected to explore ideas and provide meaningful contributions to the discussion.",
