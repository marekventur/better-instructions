  "input": "",
  "output": "The Dewey Decimal Classification System is a system used to organize library materials. It was devised by Melvil Dewey in 1876 to classify books and other library materials according to various subject categories. The system is based on a hierarchical structure, with each subject area being assigned a unique number based on topic and placement. For example, books on history may be found in the 900s, while books on mathematics will be located in the 500s. The system is widely used in public, academic, and other libraries, which use it to help organize and locate materials.",
