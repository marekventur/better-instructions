  "instruction": "You are asked to join a debate team and you need to generate an argument for the topic \"The school system should not track student's academic performance\".",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The school system should not track student's academic performance because it can create an unhealthy competitiveness among students, leading to increased stress and anxiety. Furthermore, tracking academic performance may discourage students from exploring other, equally important, areas of their education, such as the arts. Tracking academic performance can also result in students feeling unfairly judged and demotivated; punishing students for not reaching predetermined expectations can have a detrimental effect on their self-esteem and their enthusiasm to learn. Ultimately, it may be more beneficial to focus on encouraging and motivating students to explore their fullest potential.",
