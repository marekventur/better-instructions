  "input": "",
  "output": "One common approach to detect plagiarism in documents is through the use of algorithms. An algorithm typically searches for similar variants in the text, such as syntax, repeated words, and phrases. It also looks for similarities in text structure, punctuation, and formatting. Additionally, algorithms may scan for similarities in source citations and citations of facts, figures, or other data. The algorithm can then flag suspicious portions of the text and inform the user of possible plagiarism.",
