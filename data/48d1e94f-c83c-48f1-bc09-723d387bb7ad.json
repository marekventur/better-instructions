  "output": "A pie chart is a type of graph that displays data in sectors of a circle. It is used to compare the relative proportions of different categories of data, such as percentages or proportions. The elements of a pie chart include the pie itself which holds the data, the title which states what the chart is about, the categories which divide the data, and the legend which explains the colors and labels used for the categories. Pie charts are a useful way to quickly compare relative proportions of large amounts of data.",
