  "input": "",
  "output": "The change-of-base formula is an equation used to convert numbers between different number bases. It states that if you have two numbers, a and b, with base b, then the value of a in base 10 can be found by calculating the sum of all the digits in a multiplied by the appropriate power of b. This formula can be used to convert from any base to another as long as the bases are different.",
