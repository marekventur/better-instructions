  "output": "A comparison operator is a special type of operator used in programming languages to compare two values and return a true or false, depending on the result of the comparison. Some examples of comparison operators are == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), and <= (less than or equal to). These comparison operators are used in if-statements, loops, and other programming structures to test certain conditions.",
