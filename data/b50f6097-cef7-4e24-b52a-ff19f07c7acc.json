  "input": "",
  "output": "Go Fish is a classic card game for two to six players. The goal is to collect as many sets of four of a kind as possible. Each player is dealt seven cards. The remaining cards become the draw pile, and the top card of the pile is turned over to act as the discard pile. Players take turns asking for a specific rank of card from another player, and if the other player has a card of that rank, they must give it to the player who asked. If they don\u2019t have a card of that rank, they say \u201cGo Fish\u201d and the asking player takes a card from the draw pile. The game is over when a player has all four of one kind or the draw pile is emptied. The player with the most sets of four of a kind is the winner.",
