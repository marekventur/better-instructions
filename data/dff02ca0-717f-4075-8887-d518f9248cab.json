  "output": "Alice was always fascinated with the night sky. She often snuck out of her house late at night just to admire space in all its glory. One night she was out gazing at the stars when she noticed a strange blue light in the distance. It was moving closer to her, and before she knew it, she was surrounded by a swarm of tiny aliens. They asked her to come with them, and without hesitation she accepted their invitation. She knew it was an adventure she'd never forget. Alice boarded their spaceship and was taken to a distant planet she'd never seen before. There she met extraordinary aliens and saw beautiful sights far beyond her imagination. She made friends with them and eventually returned home to tell everyone about her amazing journey.",
