  "output": "AI can be used by businesses to provide personalized customer service by using natural language processing (NLP) to process customer queries and generate responses. For example, if a customer inquires about the status of their order, the AI-powered chatbot would be able to interpret the query, access customer records, and provide the customer with an accurate response. AI can also be used to provide customers with personalized recommendations based on their past purchases, helping them find the product or service that best suits their needs.",
