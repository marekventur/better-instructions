  "instruction": "Identify and explain the 6 main layers of the atmosphere.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The atmosphere is made up of six main layers, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, exosphere, troposphere and tropopause. \n\nThe stratosphere is the second layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and lies above the troposphere. It extends from 10 km to 50 km in altitude and is characterized by its temperature stability, as the temperature generally increases with altitude. The ozone layer, which absorbs much of the sun's ultraviolet radiation, is found in this layer.\n\nThe mesosphere is the third layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and lies between the stratosphere and the thermosphere. It lies between 50 and 80 km in altitude and is characterized by the coldest temperatures in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThe thermosphere is the fourth layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and is the highest layer of the atmosphere, extending from 80 km to 660 km in altitude. It\u2019s characterized by very high temperatures, which increase with altitude.\n\nThe exosphere is the fifth layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and extends from 660 km to 10,000 km in altitude. It is the layer where most of the atoms and molecules in the atmosphere escape into space.\n\nThe troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, extending from sea level to 10 km in altitude. It\u2019s characterized by the presence of clouds and weather, as it is the layer where the weather in Earth\u2019s atmosphere takes place.\n\nThe tropopause is the dividing line between the troposphere and the stratosphere, and is typically found at a height of 10 km to 16 km in altitude. It is marked by a sudden decrease in temperature, as the air temperature in the troposphere decreases with height, and the air temperature in the stratosphere increases with height.",
