  "instruction": "Create a design for a t-shirt that celebrates your home state or country.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "I would create a design for a t-shirt that celebrates my home country, India. The design would include imagery of the Taj Mahal, the Monument of Love, which is a famous landmark in India. A backdrop of Indian traditional art forms, such as Madhubani or Rangoli, could be used to add more colour and detail. The Taj Mahal could be placed at the centre of the design, with the text \u2018India\u2019 written around it. Other text like \u2018Made with Love\u2019 and \u2018Unconditional Devotion\u2019 could be included to capture India\u2019s spirit of love and devotion. To complete the design, Indian Flag colours, saffron, white and green, can be used as the background colour of the t-shirt, creating an eye-catching and vibrant design.",
