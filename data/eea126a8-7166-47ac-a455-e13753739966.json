  "output": "Having a healthy work-life balance is important for both physical and mental wellbeing. Working too much can lead to stress, burnout, and a lack of motivation. It can also affect relationships and hobbies. On the other hand, having a work-life balance provides a sense of satisfaction, help maintain morale, and gives an individual more time to spend with family and friends, as well as to engage in rewarding hobbies. Striving for a healthy work-life balance is beneficial both for individual\u2019s health and overall sense of wellbeing, as well as to society as a whole.",
