  "instruction": "Explain why the following formula works.",
  "input": "2x + 3 = 7",
  "output": "This formula works because when the two sides of the equation are equal, the left side must be equal to the right side. Therefore, the equation can be solved by subtracting 3 from both sides to get 2x = 4, and then divide both sides by 2 to get x = 2, which shows that x must be equal to 2 in order for the equation to be true.",
