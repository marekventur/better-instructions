  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a young girl who lived in a small village at the edge of a great mountain range. One day, she decided to venture into the mountains in search of adventure. After a long day of wandering, she came across an ancient cave. In the darkness, she saw two glowing eyes, and a voice said, \"I am the dragon of this mountain.\" She was terrified, yet intrigued, and the dragon said, \"If you can answer one question for me, I will grant you one wish.\" The girl mustered all her courage and answered the dragon's question. To her amazement, the dragon granted her wish, and gave her a magical gift before she left. From then on, she always remembered the magical moment she met the dragon in the mountains.",
