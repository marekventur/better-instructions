  "input": "",
  "output": "Orca whales and dolphins are both mammals that live in the ocean. They have similar shapes and sizes, and both have curved dorsal fins. They are both highly social animals, living in groups and communicating with each other through a variety of vocalizations. They both hunt for fish, squid, and other aquatic animals, though orcas tend to hunt larger prey. They both take care of their young and can form strong family bonds.",
