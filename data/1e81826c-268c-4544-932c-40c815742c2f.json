  "instruction": "Analyze the effectiveness of the methods used in the following experiment.",
  "input": "Subjects were asked to play a game in which they had to guess which of two cups contained a reward.",
  "output": "The effectiveness of this experiment was determined by how well the subjects were able to guess the correct cup. To accurately measure this, the subjects were asked to make their responses within a set amount of time. If a subject made a correct guess, they received a reward, and if they were incorrect, they were penalized. This method allowed for a clear measure of how effective each subject was in making accurate guesses.",
