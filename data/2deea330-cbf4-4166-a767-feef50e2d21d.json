  "instruction": "Design an airplane seating chart.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An airplane seating chart can be designed by taking into account the size of the airplane, the number of passengers, and the number of rows in the plane. Typically, the seating chart will start with the rows of economy seating closest to the back of the plane. Business and first class seating will typically be located in the middle and front of the plane, respectively. It is important to take into account any policies the airline may have for special seating, such as for passengers with special needs or unaccompanied minors. Based on the size and shape of the aircraft, the seating chart should be designed accordingly to maximize space and use of the cabin.",
