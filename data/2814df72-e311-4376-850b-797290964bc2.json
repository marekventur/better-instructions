  "input": "",
  "output": "Two examples of types of agricultural subsidies are direct payments and price supports. Direct payments are subsidies that a government pays to a farmer for a specific purpose, such as conservation or production maintenance. Price supports represent the difference between market prices and artificially fixed prices that the government has set, allowing growers to get more for their products than they would have without the support.",
