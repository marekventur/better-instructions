  "output": "Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are two emerging technologies that have become prominent in recent years. VR creates a completely immersive computer-generated environment, while AR overlays digital elements onto the real world. Both technologies can be used for gaming, education, enterprise, and more. However, VR is better suited for experiences that require a completely immersive environment, while AR is more appropriate for tasks that involve interacting with the physical world.",
