  "output": "The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) paints a disturbing picture of the future of the planet. The report states that climate change poses an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the natural world, causing more extreme weather, rising sea levels, and an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts, floods, and extreme heat. In order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, the report calls for drastic, unprecedented reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as improved land management, technologies, and lifestyle choices. The report emphasizes the need to act quickly and decisively in order to prevent further damage to the environment and human society.",
