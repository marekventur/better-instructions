  "input": "",
  "output": "A machine learning library is a collection of code that is used to build and deploy machine learning models. It contains functions and methods for training models, making predictions, and optimizing models. An AI framework is a set of tools, libraries, and software components that allow developers to build artificial intelligence applications. AI frameworks provide a more high-level approach to machine learning, giving developers the ability to configure models and select algorithms without needing to code the entire model themselves.",
