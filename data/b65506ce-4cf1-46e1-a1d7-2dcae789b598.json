  "output": "The sketch should feature a tree with a large trunk and multiple branches. The trunk should be tall and strong, with the branches reaching outward, stretching up and down as if to form a canopy. There should be plenty of leaves, in a variety of shades of green, to give the tree a realistic look.",
