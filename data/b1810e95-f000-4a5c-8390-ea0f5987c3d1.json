  "output": "Two types of pollution that can lead to global warming are air pollution and water pollution. Air pollution is caused by emissions from vehicles, factories, and burning fossil fuels. Water pollution can come from runoff from fertilizers, sewage, and plastic waste. Both types of pollution contribute to the warming of the atmosphere, leading to an increase in temperature and the overall effects of global warming.",
