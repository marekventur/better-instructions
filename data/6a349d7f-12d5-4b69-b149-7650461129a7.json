  "instruction": "Describe how coordination of DNA occurs.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Coordination of DNA is a process by which the genetic information within each cell is organized and maintained. It involves the transcription of genes from DNA to messenger RNA and the translation of messenger RNA into proteins. The proteins produced by this process control the structure, function, and development of the cell. This coordination is controlled by a variety of factors, including transcription factors, protein-DNA interactions, and small, non-coding RNAs. Coordination of DNA is essential for the proper formation and functioning of cells, as well as for genetic inheritance.",
