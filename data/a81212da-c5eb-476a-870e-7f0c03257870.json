  "output": "Laughter spun around in joy,\nInfectious, its happy noise;\nWith grace it stirs the soul,\nAnd joy it does release.\n\nHeartache fades away so fast,\nThen we see life anew;\nLaughter laughingly invites,\nTo joy, so fresh and true.\n\nHappy, sunny days, we see,\nFor life, so cruelly torn;\nLaughter jumping all around,\nJoy, now, freshly born!",
