  "input": "",
  "output": "I would create a supervised learning algorithm to predict the demand for a product. I would start by training a model on historical data of the product using various features such as price, promotion, seasonality data, promotional campaigns and their interactions. From this trained model, I would be able to predict the demand for the product using additional features such as new marketing campaigns. I would also incorporate regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the accuracy of the prediction.",
