  "instruction": "Can you explain how to calculate mean median and mode?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Mean: The mean is determined by taking the sum of all values and dividing by the number of values. \n\nMedian: The median is the middle value when the values are placed in order of size. If the number of values is odd, the median is the middle value; and if the number of values is even, the median is the average of the middle two values. \n\nMode: The mode is the most commonly occurring value in a data set. If no values repeat, there is no mode.",
