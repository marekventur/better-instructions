  "output": "Once there were two brothers, Jake and Sam, who lived on the same farm in the countryside. Jake was diligent and worked hard every day to help out on the farm, while Sam was lazy and often wasted his time doing nothing. \n\nOne day, the two brothers decided to go fishing. Jake managed to catch a large fish, which he proudly displayed to his brother, while Sam had caught nothing. Sam grew jealous of his brother's success and decided to try and take it for himself. In the struggle for the fish, it was dropped and returned to the water. \n\nMoral of the story: Greed will always lead to loss, while hard work and diligence will lead to success.",
