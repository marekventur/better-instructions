  "output": "The idiomatic phrase \"One man's meat is another man's poison\" is a proverb used to refer to the idea that different people have different tastes and preferences. It emphasizes that something that one person may find unappealing or disagreeable may be enjoyable or appealing to another person. In other words, what one person finds acceptable or desirable may be distasteful to another person. Therefore, this phrase suggests that people should not judge other people's opinions or preferences too harshly.",
