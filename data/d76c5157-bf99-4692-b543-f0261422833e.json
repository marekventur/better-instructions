  "input": "",
  "output": "American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL) are two distinct forms of signed languages used in different countries. ASL is mainly used in the United States and Canada, while BSL is mainly used in the United Kingdom. The two languages have different grammatical structure and use different signs. The syntax and non-manual markers used in BSL are often very different from those used in ASL. The visual-gestural nature of the two languages makes it difficult for those who are used to speaking English orally to learn either language.",
