  "instruction": "Recreate the given recipe in a healthy way.",
  "input": "Chocolate cake",
  "output": "For a healthier version of chocolate cake, substitute whole-wheat flour for all-purpose flour, and replace the sugar with applesauce or stevia. Use unsweetened cocoa powder and semi-sweet chocolate chips to boost the chocolate flavor. For the fat, opt for coconut oil or vegan butter. Finally, use almond or coconut milk instead of regular milk. The resulting cake will still be rich and delicious, but much lower in calories and evil fats.",
