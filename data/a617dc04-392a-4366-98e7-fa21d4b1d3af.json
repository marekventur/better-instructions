  "input": "",
  "output": "The past decade has seen an upsurge in global temperatures, leading to a range of impacts on the planet. Rising sea levels, increased flooding, droughts, extreme weather, and dramatic declines in certain animal populations have all been attributed to global warming. Recent studies show that emissions of greenhouse gases have accelerated in the past ten years due to human activities, leading to an estimated 0.5 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures each decade. Unless drastic measures are taken, the effects of global warming and the resulting climate change will only become more severe in the years to come.",
