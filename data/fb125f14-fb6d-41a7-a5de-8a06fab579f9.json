  "input": "",
  "output": "An effective meeting requires clear objectives and an agenda that outlines the topics to be discussed. All attendees should be informed of when and where the meeting will take place, and every participant should be given the chance to be heard. The meeting should be well structured, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. During the meeting, encourage open and constructive dialogue, allowing everyone to voice their opinions and ideas. Quick breaks should be taken throughout the meeting to foster productivity, and stewardship should be taken to make sure the meeting does not run over the allotted time. Effective meetings should also touch on any prior action items that were identified, and end with a clear \u201cto do\u201d list for all involved parties.",
