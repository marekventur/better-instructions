  "input": "",
  "output": "I would prioritize my remaining tasks by urgency, complexity and scope. If the task has a fast approach, I will make sure to finish it as quickly as possible. If the task is complicated and requires more effort, I will try to do it as efficiently as possible within the 10 minutes limit. Lastly, if the task involves a wide scope, I will focus on completing the most important parts first.",
