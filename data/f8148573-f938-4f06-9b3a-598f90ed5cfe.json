  "output": "Making a classic Manhattan cocktail is easy and quick. To make one, start by adding two ounces of rye whiskey, one ounce of sweet vermouth, and two dashes of angostura bitters to a mixing glass with ice. Then, stir the mixture until it is chilled and strain it into a chilled lowball glass. Finally, add a few brandied cherries and serve.",
