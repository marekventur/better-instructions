  "input": "",
  "output": "A beekeeper's day starts early, typically well before the sun rises. Once dressed in the protective veil and suit, the beekeeper heads out to the hive and begins his inspection for any signs of disease or infestation. Once satisfied, the beekeeper will move frames of honey and pollen around the beehive and collect what the bees have collected. Later, the beekeeper will feed the bees sugar syrup or pollen patties as needed and may add extra boxes to the hive. After the hive is complete, the beekeeper packages up the day's honey harvest and brings it back to the shop for labeling and sale. Through each season the routine may change slightly but the overall care and production of honey remains the same.",
