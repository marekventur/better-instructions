  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is artificial intelligence that approaches or achieves human-level performance in a wide variety of tasks. It is a highly advanced form of AI that is capable of solving any problems that it may face. The implications of AGI could be far-reaching, making it possible for machines to easily automate tasks that currently require human effort and intelligence. It could also be used to create machines that learn and adapt quickly to changes in the environment and become more intelligent over time.",
