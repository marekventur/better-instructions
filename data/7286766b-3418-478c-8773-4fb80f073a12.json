  "output": "The next step in making chocolate truffles is to prepare the truffle's coating. Start with a bowl of melted chocolate and stir in cream, butter, and corn syrup until the mixture is homogeneous. Transfer the mixture to a shallow dish, such as a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Drop spoonfuls of the mixture into the chocolate and use two forks or a spoon to roll each truffle until they are round and evenly coated. Place the truffles in the refrigerator or freezer and leave until they are set.",
