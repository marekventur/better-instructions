  "output": "The first step of presenting a report is to prepare the materials that will be associated with the presentation. This includes organizing the content of the report, visual aids, and other resources. Once prepared, rehearse the presentation to ensure clarity and accuracy. It is also important to practice with any audio/visual components that will be used during the presentation. When delivering the presentation, speak in a clear and confident tone and be aware of nonverbal cues. Be sure to allow time for questions or comments from the audience and be prepared to answer them. After the presentation, thank the audience for their time and attention. Finally, follow up with any suggestions from the audience or feedback from the presentation.",
