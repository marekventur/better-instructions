  "input": "",
  "output": "The five stages of the water cycle are evaporation, condensation, precipitation, collection, and drainage. Evaporation occurs when water from the surface of the earth is heated by the sun, causing it to become vapor and rise into the atmosphere. Condensation occurs as the vapor cools and forms clouds. Precipitation happens when the water from the clouds falls to the ground in the form of rain, sleet, snow, or hail. Collection is the process by which the precipitation flows into rivers, oceans, and underground aquifers. Drainage is when the water eventually evaporates back into the atmosphere.",
