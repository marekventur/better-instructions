  "output": "Genetic engineering is a technique that allows scientists to make precise changes to an organism's genetic code. It involves the introduction of DNA from one species into another, to add or modify a certain trait. By manipulating an organism's genes, scientists can create organisms with desired characteristics, such as disease resistance and increased productivity. Genetic engineering has had a huge impact on modern medicine and agriculture, and continues to be an important tool in these fields.",
