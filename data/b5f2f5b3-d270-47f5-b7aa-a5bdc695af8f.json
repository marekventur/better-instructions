  "output": "To add a Raspberry Pi to your home network, you will need to set up a network connection and configure the Raspberry Pi to connect to it. First, connect your Raspberry Pi to your router with an Ethernet cable or use a Wi-Fi connection if your Raspberry Pi supports it. Once your Raspberry Pi is connected, you can then configure it with a static IP address if required. Finally, run any set-up scripts, install any necessary software packages, and configure the Raspberry Pi for your specific needs.",
