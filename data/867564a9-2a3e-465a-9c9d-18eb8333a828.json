  "input": "",
  "output": "A typical networking cable typically consists of three items: an RJ-45 connector, a plastic sheath, and four to eight twisted pairs of copper wires. The RJ-45 connector plugs into wall jacks and Ethernet ports and serves as a way for the cable to be connected securely. The sheath provides insulation, reinforcement, and protection against electrical interference. The twisted pairs of copper wires are used to transmit data signals.",
