  "input": "",
  "output": "The European Union (EU) was taken by surprise at the results of the Brexit referendum of 2016, when the United Kingdom voted to leave the bloc. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, immediately began discussions with the UK government to come to an agreement on the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. The UK was offered a transition period until the end of 2020 to negotiate a trade deal and decide upon issues such as the status of citizens\u2019 rights, the Northern Ireland border, and the payment of the so-called \u201cBrexit bill\u201d. Since then, the EU has continued to press for an orderly withdrawal agreement in order to maintain security and stability during the withdrawal process.",
