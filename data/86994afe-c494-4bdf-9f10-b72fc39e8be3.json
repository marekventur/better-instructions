  "instruction": "Use natural language processing to group similar customer inquiries.",
  "input": "Customer Inquiry 1: \"What type of warranties do you offer for your products?\" \nCustomer Inquiry 2: \"What is the warranty for my purchase?\"",
  "output": "The customer inquiries can be grouped using natural language processing techniques. The first step would be to pre-process the text by performing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and removing stopwords. Then, the text can be represented using vector space models, such as Bag Of Words (BOW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). These vector representations of the text can then be compared using clustering algorithms to identify similarities between the customer inquiries. Once clusters of similar customer inquiries are identified, they can then be given appropriate labels to provide better organization.",
