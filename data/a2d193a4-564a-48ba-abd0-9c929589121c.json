  "output": "A strategy for learning a language quickly involves using a combination of different methods. Start by establishing the primary goals of what you want to learn, such as reading, listening, speaking, or writing. This will give you an overall framework to build on. Then, begin by learning the basics such as pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Focus on listening and repeating key phrases, and familiarize yourself with the way words, sentences, and dialogues are structured. Incorporate a variety of content such as books, videos, podcasts, and other learning apps to keep you motivated and engaged. Finally, practice regularly and stay consistent with your learning. Set aside some time during the day to engage with language, even if it is just for a few minutes.",
