  "input": "",
  "output": "You can try to remove oil stains from yellow fabric by pre-treating it with a detergent or detergent solution. Then, you should dab the stained area with some paper towels to blot up as much of the excess oil as you can. Next, cover the spot with a thin layer of baking soda, which will absorb the remaining oil. Once the baking soda has dried, use a vacuum cleaner to remove it. Finally, launder the garment according to the fabric's care instructions.",
