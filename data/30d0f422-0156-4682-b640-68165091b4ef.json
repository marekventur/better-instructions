  "input": "",
  "output": "The argument that most accurately supports the title, \u201cReligious Education Should Not Be Taught in Public Schools\u201d, is that allowing religious education in public school could violate the separation of church and state. Allowing religious education in public schools would also undermine the neutrality of the school, creating division among students and potentially interfering with their right to freedom of religion. Additionally, it could lead to the privileging of certain religious beliefs, which could create an unjust environment in the classroom.",
