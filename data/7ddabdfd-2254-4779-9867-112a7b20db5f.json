  "output": "The flowers of spring, the joy that it brings, \nThe sun in the skies, the rain that will rise, \nA misty morning, a lovely afternoon, \nThe beauty of life within a single bloom. \n\nThe birds that will sing, the days that will bring, \nThe moments to share, the things to be spared, \nA gentle reminder that life is alive, \nWhen the seasons shall change, the soul will revive.",
