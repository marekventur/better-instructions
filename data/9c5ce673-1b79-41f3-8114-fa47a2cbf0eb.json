  "input": "",
  "output": "K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering are both types of unsupervised learning algorithms used for clustering. K-Means is a hard clustering approach that creates clusters with a certain number of data points assigned to each cluster. Hierarchical Clustering is a soft clustering approach that creates clusters based on the distance between data points. K-Means is more popular and computationally efficient but can be affected by outliers, while Hierarchical Clustering is more flexible and can handle outliers better.",
