  "instruction": "Given the input, explain why beaches are important habitats for animals.",
  "input": "Beaches provide a unique habitat to a wide variety of marine animals, including fish, crustaceans, and sea birds.",
  "output": "Beaches are important habitats for animals because they provide food, shelter and space for animals to live and reproduce. In addition, beaches provide a rich source of food for animals, as the tidal action of the ocean creates new sources of nutrients in the sand. In addition, beaches provide nesting grounds for many species of marine birds such as terns, gulls and sandpipers. Lastly, beaches provide refuge from predators and a place to rest and hide during extreme weather events.",
