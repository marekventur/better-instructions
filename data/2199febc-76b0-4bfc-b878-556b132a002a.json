  "input": "",
  "output": "The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dal\u00ed is a surrealist painting famous for its melted clocks. The soft and melting clocks symbolize the instability and lack of control of time and how even the most solid objects are rendered powerless by the passing of time. The ants, which appear to be devouring the clocks, may symbolize the destructiveness of time. The stuffed whale and elephant may symbolize the inability to escape death, as the creatures are both dead and stuffed. The color of the painting is said to symbolize sorrow and nostalgia, as well as a sense of disconnect between the world of dreams and reality.",
