  "input": "",
  "output": "The key differences between butterflies and moths are primarily in their anatomy, behavior, and life cycles. Butterflies have larger wings that have brightly-colored patterns and typically fly during the day. In contrast, moths tend to be nocturnal and have dull colors and feathery patterns on their wings. Additionally, butterflies typically have slimmer bodies and antennae that have a clubbed end, while moths tend to have thicker bodies and feathery antennae. Finally, butterflies typically have complete metamorphosis in their life cycle, while moths tend to have a simpler life cycle with only two stages.",
