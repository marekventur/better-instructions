  "input": "Problem: How to reduce plastic waste",
  "output": "One possible solution to reduce plastic waste is to use recycled plastic in manufacturing processes. By using recycled plastic, we would be able to reuse materials that would otherwise end up in landfills or the ocean. Additionally, encouraging the use of reusable and sustainable materials, such as glass or metal, would reduce the amount of new plastic being produced. Finally, advocating for companies to use environmentally friendly packaging and encouraging people to avoid single-use plastics would also help reduce plastic waste.",
