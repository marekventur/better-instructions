  "input": "",
  "output": "On a bright summer day, a human astronaut was traveling through the reaches of space when his spaceship suddenly began to malfunction. As he frantically searched for a way to repair the vessel, he encountered an alien from a distant planet, who offered to help him. Together they worked to fix the spacecraft, and as thanks, the astronaut took the alien on a tour of Earth once they arrived back home. They visited a variety of landmarks and experienced different cultures, eventually becoming close friends in the process.",
