  "instruction": "Create a computer program that can search its environment for a red ball.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The program will first scan its environment for a red ball. It will use a variety of sensors and algorithms to detect the ball's presence and location. Once a red ball is found, the program will then process the data to determine the ball's size and distance. Finally, it will take action in the environment to pick up the ball or move toward it to explore further.",
