  "instruction": "Explain why whales are endangered.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Whales are endangered due to various factors, including hunting, entanglement in fishing nets, pollution, and the destruction of their habitats. Over-fishing of the oceans has caused their food supplies to decrease, leading to nutritional deficiencies, where their reproductive cycle and health have been adversely affected. Plastic waste, noise pollution, and ship traffic has caused them to become disoriented, interfere with their communication, and impair their senses. Additionally, climate change has shifted the availability of their prey and habitats, further threatening their populations.",
