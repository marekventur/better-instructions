  "input": "Phenomenon: Global warming",
  "output": "The possible causes of global warming can be attributed to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane, due to the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and land-use change; the release of greenhouse gases from industrial processes and agriculture; and the decrease of the Earth's reflective capacity due to the destruction of natural surfaces. \n\nOther possible causes include changes in the Earth's Orbital parameters, solar irradiance, and volcanic eruptions.",
