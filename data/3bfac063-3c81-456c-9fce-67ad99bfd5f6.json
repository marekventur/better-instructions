  "input": "",
  "output": "AI can be used to reduce bias and discrimination in a variety of ways. For example, AI algorithms can be trained to make decisions based on objective criteria and to recognize patterns of bias that can be responsible for discriminatory outcomes. AI can also be used to audit existing decision-making processes in order to identify any potential areas of bias. Additionally, AI can be used to detect and respond to instances of discrimination in real-time by identifying patterns of biased outcomes and alerting the appropriate authorities.",
