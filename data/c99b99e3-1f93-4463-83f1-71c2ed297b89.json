  "input": "",
  "output": "A proactive approach to problem-solving involves looking ahead, anticipating potential problems, and taking action to prevent them before they occur. It focuses on long-term solutions and involves careful planning and evaluation. A reactive approach, on the other hand, involves responding to problems after they have occurred. It is focused on finding short-term solutions and is more reactive, as it does not involve anticipating future problems.",
