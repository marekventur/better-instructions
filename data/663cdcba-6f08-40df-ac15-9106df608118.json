  "output": "To make banana bread, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. In a medium bowl, mash 2 ripe bananas with a fork. In another bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. In a larger bowl, cream together 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar until light and fluffy. Add 2 eggs, one at a time, then mix in the mashed bananas. Slowly add in the dry ingredients until everything is combined. Lastly, fold in 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts (optional). Spread the batter into a greased 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Let the banana bread cool for 10 minutes and enjoy!",
