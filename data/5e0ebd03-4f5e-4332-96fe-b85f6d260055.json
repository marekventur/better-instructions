  "input": "",
  "output": "A rise in sea levels would have significant economic implications. It would lead to decreased coastal property values, increased flooding and storm damage in coastal areas, destruction of coastal habitats and ecosystems, increased cost of infrastructure protection, and greater strain on existing water resources, among other consequences. Additionally, rising sea levels could create displacement of coastal communities and destruction of vital coastal infrastructure.",
