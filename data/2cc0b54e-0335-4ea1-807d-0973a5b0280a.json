  "instruction": "How has the usage of the word \"data\" changed since the introduction of the internet?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The word \"data\" has been used much more freely and widely since the introduction of the internet, as the internet has enabled a much greater amount of data to be collected and analyzed. Previously, data was much more limited in terms of how much information could be collected, and how that data could be used or accessed. Since the internet has become more commonplace, data has become much more accessible and has become a fundamental part of how businesses, governments, and individuals make decisions. Also, the terms \"big data\" and \"data science\" have been popularized, illustrating the importance of data in a digital age.",
