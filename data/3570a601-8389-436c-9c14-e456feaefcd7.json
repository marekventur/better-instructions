  "input": "The air conditioner in the office is not working correctly.",
  "output": "The problem could be due to a number of issues, such as an electrical issue, a broken part, or a blockage preventing the flow of heated or cool air. To diagnose the issue, the system should first be checked for possible obstructions or debris. If none are found, the electrical system should be assessed for any problems, such as a trip switch that needs resetting, or a faulty component that needs replacing.",
