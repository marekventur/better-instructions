  "input": "",
  "output": "An interest rate is the amount charged by a lender for the use of its money. It is typically expressed as a percentage and is based on the amount of money borrowed, length of the loan and the risk of default. When you borrow money from a lender, you will be obligated to pay back the total amount borrowed plus interest over the term of the loan; the interest rate determines how much of the total payment is comprised of interest. Interest is a way for lenders to make a profit and can be used as an incentive for borrowers to choose a particular lender.",
