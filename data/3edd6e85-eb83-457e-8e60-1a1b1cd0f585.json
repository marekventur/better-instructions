  "input": "",
  "output": "The proposed experiment would involve participants randomly assigned to a control group or a group consuming caffeine. The task required of each group would be a standardized cognitive test that measures reaction time, focus, and accuracy. Participants would also be asked to rate their alertness before and after completing the task. The results of the experiment would then be compared to measure the effect of caffeine on cognitive performance.",
