But lately he had been feeling more timid than usual, as if all his bravery and sense of adventure had disappeared. He couldn't understand what was causing him to feel this way, until one night he had a dream that revealed the truth - he was afraid of the unknown, too afraid to explore and experience new things. With his newfound realization, John was able to push through his fear and face the unknown with courage and curiosity.",
