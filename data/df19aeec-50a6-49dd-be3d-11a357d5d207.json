  "input": "",
  "output": "The classicist view of the world is based on the idea that the universe is an orderly and rational system, governed by a set of rules or laws that are immutable and universal, and that reason and logic are the best methods for understanding the world. In this view, all knowledge must be based on objective, empirical observations. They believe that ultimate reality is best expressed and understood through deductive reasoning and logical arguments. Classical thinking also stresses the importance of tradition and stability. It is also characterized by an adherence to rigorous standards of precision, measurement and proof.",
