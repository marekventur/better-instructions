  "output": "The Big Bang Theory is the scientific explanation for the beginning of our universe. It suggests that the universe started from an energetic singularity, which underwent an exponential expansion and generated all of the matter and energy that exist today. The Big Bang Theory is supported by scientific observations, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and red-shift of distant galaxies. It is believed that the Big Bang happened roughly 13.8 billion years ago and it is still expanding today. This makes the Big Bang provides a foundation for cosmology, which is the study of the universe and its development.",
