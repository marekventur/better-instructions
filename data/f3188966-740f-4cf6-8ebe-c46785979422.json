Identity theft can occur when a hacker gains access to banking information and personal data, such as Social Security Numbers and credit card numbers. Fraud can occur when someone uses stolen banking information to make unauthorized purchases. Phishing is when a malicious actor sends fake emails asking for personal information. Account hacking involves theft using malware, key-logging, or brute force attacks. Data breaches can occur when confidential information is stolen, and malware can install malicious software on a computer to gain access to banking credentials.",
