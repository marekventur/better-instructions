  "output": "The eligibility criteria for a marathon varies from race to race. Generally, entrants must be at least 16 years old and meet a physical fitness standard that is set by the organizers. Some marathons may require entrants to provide proof of their fitness level via a doctor's note or other form of approval. Additionally, age and disability categories might be considered to ensure equality and safety. Marathon organizers may also require entrants to have completed a training program, or complete a race before the event.",
