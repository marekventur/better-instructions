  "output": "Plants and animals both rely on their environment for survival. They need food, water, and the right temperature to survive. Plants and animals also have cells and require energy in the form of sunlight, or food in the case of animals, to help them grow and reproduce. As well, both plants and animals go through the process of evolution in order to adapt to their changing environment. Furthermore, they both have the ability to sense their environment and respond to stimuli. Finally, both organisms are essential for maintaining the balance of the global ecosystem.",
