  "instruction": "Generate a paragraph describing the impact of climate change on family farms.",
  "input": "No input required.",
  "output": "Climate change has had a devastating effect on family farms around the world. As temperatures rise, many crops become more susceptible to drought, and weather patterns become increasingly unpredictable. This can cause financial hardship, with losses in the millions of dollars per year, leading to the closure of many family-run farms. Not only are farmers affected by extreme weather, but their land and livestock suffer too. As temperatures continue to rise, their once-fertile pastures and land become dry and barren, and their animals suffer from the heat and lack of food. In order to keep up with the changing demand for food, family farms must adapt to these new climates, or face extinction.",
