  "instruction": "Analyze the changes in DNA sequences for a specific gene.",
  "input": "Gene: HBA1\nDNA sequence 1: CCCTACAACCTGC\nDNA sequence 2: GTATTAACCATCC",
  "output": "The analysis of the HBA1 gene shows that there have been three changes in the DNA sequence from CCCTACAACCTGC to GTATTAACCATCC. The first change is a substitution of a C to an A at location 2, followed by a transversion of a T to a G at location 7, and a transversion of a C to a T at location 10. These changes indicate that the gene has undergone some mutation and may affect its function.",
