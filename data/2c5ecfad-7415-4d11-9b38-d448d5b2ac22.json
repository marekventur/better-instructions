  "input": "",
  "output": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data while still preserving most of the information contained in the original dataset. It works by transforming the data into a set of uncorrelated variables, also known as principal components, that explain most of the variance in the data. PCA is a useful tool for data visualization, feature extraction, and noise reduction. It can also be used to identify outliers and reduce the computational cost of certain learning algorithms by reducing the dimensionality of data.",
