  "output": "The dress features a light, natural-colored cotton fabric with a bright floral pattern. It has a sweetheart neckline and a tie-back feature to adjust the fit of the dress. Thin straps attach to a wide waistband that sits right at the natural waistline. The pleated skirt flares out to the knee and falls just below the knee. The dress also has a subtle asymmetrical hem, giving the dress its stylish look.",
