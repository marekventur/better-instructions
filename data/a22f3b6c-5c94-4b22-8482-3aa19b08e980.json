  "instruction": "Compare two different albums.",
  "input": "Beyonce, Lemonade and Rihanna, Anti",
  "output": "Beyonce's album Lemonade is a complicated and thought-provoking exploration of love, womanhood, and race. Brooding and intense, it is musically complex and lyrically powerful. Rihanna's album Anti, however, is a more light-hearted and upbeat affair, with synth-pop influences and a vibrant sound. While there are some serious themes addressed, the tone is much more optimistic and uplifting than Lemonade.",
