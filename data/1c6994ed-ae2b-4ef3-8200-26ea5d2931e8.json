I've been visiting some relatives I haven't seen in years, and I find it so refreshing!\n\nFriend 2: That's great! I can't wait for the rest of summer break! What are your plans for the remainder?\n\nFriend 1: Well, I'm thinking of taking up a new hobby. You?\n\nFriend 2: Yeah, I think I'm going to take a few online classes to learn something new. It'll be great to learn something new and keep my mind sharp. How about you? \n\nFriend 1: That sounds great! I think I'm going to try to teach myself a new language. That should be fun! Anything else planned?\n\nFriend 2: Hmm, maybe a few more trips here and there. Other than that, I'm just looking forward to spending time with family and friends. How about you? \n\nFriend 1: Yeah, same! This summer is going to be awesome!",
