  "input": "",
  "output": "The potential harms of an AI system that judges users based on their online activity include unfair and biased judgments, privacy breaches, and the further propagation of existing power and wealth imbalances. The AI system may draw incorrect conclusions and make decisions that are unfair or biased against certain users. Additionally, the system may access and use data without the user's consent, thus violating the user's privacy. Finally, the system could further propagate existing power and wealth imbalances by privileging users from privileged backgrounds.",
