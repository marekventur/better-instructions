  "instruction": "Create a program that can detect a respiratory illness.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The program should start by collecting patient data such as age, gender, and medical history. It should then look for symptoms typically associated with respiratory illnesses such as a fever, coughing, and shortness of breath. It should also check symptoms such as chest pain, fatigue, and sore throat, as they could be signs of a respiratory illness. The program should have the ability to assess the severity of the illness and suggest a specialized treatment plan. It should also have the ability to differentiate between different types of illnesses and recommend a combination of medical and self-care treatments that best fit the patient's condition.",
