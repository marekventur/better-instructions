  "instruction": "Generate a hypothesis about why there is a higher diversity of species near the equator.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The higher temperatures and greater light intensity near the equator create a more hospitable environment for a wider variety of species, resulting in higher biodiversity. Additionally, the longer days near the equator provide more time for species to reproduce or take advantage of resources.",
