  "output": "I was walking through the woods on a cold, dark evening when I stumbled upon an old, abandoned house. I slowly pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside. The house was filled with a thick layer of dust, the furniture was overturned and covered in cobwebs. As I moved further in, I spotted two red eyes peering at me from the corner of the room. Suddenly, a figure swooped in from the darkness and grabbed me. I screamed and scrambled for the door, but it was too late. It had me in its grip and I couldn't escape.",
