  "input": "",
  "output": "Wind power works by converting the kinetic energy of wind in the form of air movement into a form of renewable electricity. This is done by using large turbines that function similarly to a fan, with a blades that spin when the wind passes through them, causing the turbines to rotate and the generator connected to them to produce electricity.",
