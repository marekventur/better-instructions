  "input": "",
  "output": "My algorithm to detect faulty code consists of the following steps: \n1. Preprocessing: Extract desired source code metrics like lines of code, program structure, and static analysis of the code. \n2. Define criteria for flagging faulty code: Analyze and define appropriate thresholds for each metric.\n3. Identify and classify faulty code: Compare code metrics to established thresholds and assign to classes of problem code.\n4. Report on problem code: Generate a report summarizing the problem code found and provide suggestions on how to fix the issues.  \n5. Post-processing: Automatically or manually refactor or update faulty code.",
