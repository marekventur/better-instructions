  "output": "The bonds we make with our friends,\nWhich joy and peace portend,\nAre made to last 'til life's end,\nFor friendship needs neither mends.\n\nThough partings sometimes may come,\nThe memories linger near.\nThe dark of night no longer seems so glum,\nFor the friends we often hold so dear.\n\nNo matter where life's tides may drift,\nTrue friends will stay, throughout our lives.\nTheir friendship will be a beautiful gift,\nGiving us strength to survive our hard striving.\n\nThe beauty of friendship everlasting,\nA happiness no one can change or test.\nThe joy of being side by side together,\nA sweet blessing, that should never be put to rest.",
