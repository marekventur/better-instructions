  "instruction": "Develop ideas for a new customer loyalty program",
  "input": "",
  "output": "We propose a customer loyalty program which rewards customers with points for referrals and purchases. Customers can earn points for referring new customers, or for purchasing certain products or services. These points can then be redeemed for discounts or rewards.\n\nThe program could also include additional incentives such as exclusive access to upcoming products, special promotional deals, or early access to sales. We can also offer additional incentives for customers who reach certain milestones, such as a certain amount of purchases or referrals.\n\nFinally, we can create a system for customers to track their progress and rewards which can be done through an app or website. This will help ensure customer engagement and ensure customer loyalty.",
