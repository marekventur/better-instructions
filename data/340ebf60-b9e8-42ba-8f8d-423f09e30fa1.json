  "instruction": "Explain why online banking is more secure than physical banking.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Online banking is typically more secure than physical banking because of the added layers of authentication. With online banking, it is difficult for fraudsters to access personal information because passwords and other authentication methods, such as phone numbers, are put in place. Additionally, most online banks have a fraud monitoring system in place to quickly recognize any suspicious activity. Physical banks are not always able to detect these types of threats as quickly and accurately.",
