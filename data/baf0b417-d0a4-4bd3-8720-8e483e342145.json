  "instruction": "Develop an algorithm that can rotate a 2D matrix by 90\u00b0 clockwise.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm should first transpose the 2D matrix, in which rows become columns and columns become rows. Then, the algorithm should reverse each row in the matrix, so that the elements in each row are in reverse order. This will result in the matrix being rotated by 90\u00b0 clockwise.",
