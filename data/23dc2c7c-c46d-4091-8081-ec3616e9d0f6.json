  "input": "",
  "output": "Lassen Volcanic National Park is located in northeastern California, about 30 miles east of Redding. The park is characterized by four volcanoes-Lassen Peak, Prospect Peak, Brokeoff Mountain, and Chaos Crags, which erupted between 1914 and 1921. Although no eruptions have occurred since, Lassen is still an active volcano and visitors to the park can often see steam rising from vents in the ground. The area also features beautiful mountain meadows, clear mountain lakes, deep forests, and hot springs. A network of trails crisscross the park and provide a great way to explore the area. Lassen Volcanic National Park is a great destination for camping, hiking, wildlife viewing, and enjoying the spectacular scenery. The park also offers interpretive programs that feature the natural and cultural history of the area.",
