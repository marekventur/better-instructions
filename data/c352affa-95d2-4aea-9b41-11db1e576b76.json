  "input": "The increasing popularity of mobile banking has decreased the need for physical banking.",
  "output": "With the rise of mobile banking, users no longer need to make frequent trips to their local bank branches to conduct financial transactions. The convenience of being able to conduct withdrawal, deposits, payments and transfers on a smartphone or tablet has led to a decrease in the need for physical banking, as users can do everything they need to do without ever having to leave their home or workplace. This has had a direct knock-on effect on traditional banks, who are no longer needed in order to conduct simple everyday financial transactions.",
