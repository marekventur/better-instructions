  "output": "One important difference between a cockroach and a cricket is their size. Cockroaches tend to be larger than crickets, usually 2 to 3 inches long, while crickets are usually 0.5 to 1.5 inches long. Both insects have six legs, but cockroaches have long antennae that can be used for sensing movement and for locating food. Crickets, however, have short antennae that are used for listening.",
