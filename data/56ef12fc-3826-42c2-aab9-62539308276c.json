  "instruction": "Come up with a solution to this puzzle: Two cats are in a room. One of them is white and the other is black. How do you separate them without relying on sound or sight?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One solution to this puzzle is to place two identical bowls at each end of the room. Place a few pieces of food in one bowl and leave the other bowl empty. Both cats will be attracted to the bowl with food, leading them to separate across the room. Additionally, any other method that relies on scent or pheromones would work, such as placing a few drops of scented oil on the opposite ends of the room.",
