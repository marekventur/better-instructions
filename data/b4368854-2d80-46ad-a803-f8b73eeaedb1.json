  "input": "",
  "output": "The main differences between aerobic and anaerobic exercise are the type of energy used, the duration of exercise, the intensity of exercise, and the effects on the body. Aerobic exercise uses oxygen-based energy and is typically performed for longer duration at lower intensity, while anaerobic exercise uses stored energy and is typically of shorter duration and higher intensity. Aerobic exercise has more long-term health benefits and helps strengthen the cardiovascular system, while anaerobic exercise helps build muscle mass.",
