Scott Fitzgerald is a story of the futile pursuits of the American Dream and is ultimately a cautionary tale of the hollowness and greed associated with it. Through the story, Fitzgerald critiques the 1920s America, exposing its empty materialism and highlighting how a person's identity and social status determines their place in society.",
