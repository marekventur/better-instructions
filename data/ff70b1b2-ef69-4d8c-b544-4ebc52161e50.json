  "input": "Program: Energy Efficiency Program\nIndustry: Technology",
  "output": "The Technology industry has seen a growing need for more energy-efficient products, particularly in an ever-shrinking regulatory environment. The emergence of the Energy Efficiency Program has enabled companies to reduce their energy costs and help reduce their environmental footprints. This has been done through the development of better energy-efficient products, and an increase in technological research and development on energy-efficient operations. This program has also helped companies to reduce the costs associated with energy use, as well as creating jobs in the energy-efficiency sector. As a result, the energy efficiency program has had a positive impact on the Technology industry, promoting a culture of environmental awareness and energy conservation.",
