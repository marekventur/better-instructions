  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a man who was incredibly arrogant. He demanded respect from everyone he encountered, and often spoke down to them. He thought he was superior to anyone who crossed his path, and made sure to make them know his opinion. One day, the man met his match. The other person was just as arrogant as the man, and the two had a heated argument. The words exchanged were mighty, and neither would budge. In the end, neither one of them won.",
