  "input": "",
  "output": "The word \"superfluous\" describes something that is unnecessarily abundant, or more than is needed. It typically implies an excess of something, where an excess is not desirable or beneficial. For example, one might say, \"There were too many chairs in the office, which made the space feel superfluous.\" By saying this, the speaker is implying that there were too many chairs and that the extra chairs were not necessary or beneficial to the environment of the office.",
