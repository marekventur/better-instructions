  "input": "",
  "output": "Love and affection are often used interchangeably, but they do have different meanings. While love is a strong emotion that can build up over time, it is a choice that people make to express their feelings for another person. Affection is a kind, gentle feeling of care and warm regard that is often expressed through hugs and kind words. Notably, affection is not necessarily contingent on a relationship; people can form deep bonds of affection with animals, objects, and others.",
