  "instruction": "Construct an argument in support of the abolishment of the death penalty.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The death penalty is an expensive form of punishment that does not deter crime and can lead to the execution of innocent people. In addition, the potential for unfairness and unequal application of the death penalty make it an unacceptable form of punishment. Abolishing the death penalty is the only ethical option, as it eliminates the risk of wrongful executions and ensures that offenders receive fair and humane treatment.",
