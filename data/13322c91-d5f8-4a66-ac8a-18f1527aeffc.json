  "instruction": "List five causes of poverty",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Five causes of poverty are: inequality and discrimination, lack of access to education and resources, lack of access to healthcare, deprivation of civil and political rights, and unsustainable economic development. Inequality and discrimination lead to limited access to important resources and opportunities while lack of access to education, healthcare, and civil and political rights further marginalizes certain populations. Additionally, unsustainable economic development contributes to poverty by failing to create a system where everyone has equal access to resources.",
