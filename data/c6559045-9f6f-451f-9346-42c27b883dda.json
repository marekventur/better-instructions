  "output": "American football, basketball, and baseball are the three most popular sports in the United States. American football emphasizes physicality and strategy, with a large emphasis on blocking, tackling and advancing the ball down the field. Basketball, on the other hand, is more reliant on athleticism and agility, with quick reflexes and accuracy necessary for successful shooting and ball handling. Finally, baseball relies heavily on skill, with the ability to hit, throw and catch a ball being the primary focus of the game. Overall, all three sports require teamwork, dedication and skill.",
