One of the sisters had the gift of magical powers and was able to perform striking miracles. Her sister, however, had no magic. One day, the magical sister revealed to her parents about her powers. Her parents were pleased and decided that the magical sister must go out into the world and exercise her magic to help people in need. So the magical sister traveled far and wide, and wherever she went, she used her amazing powers to help people in distress. Eventually, the magical sister became known throughout the kingdom and was deeply respected. After many years, she returned home and her family welcomed her with open arms. The magical sister continued to use her powers in her kingdom and was remembered forever as a great example of kindness and compassion.",
