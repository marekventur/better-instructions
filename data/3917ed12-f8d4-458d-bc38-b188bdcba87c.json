  "input": "",
  "output": "Stellar gas clouds are composed of gases and dust that are bound within a single star system. They are typically composed of hydrogen, helium, and small amounts of heavier elements. Interstellar gas clouds, on the other hand, are composed of particles and gases liberated by stars, and become more diffuse with increasing distance from the star. They are typically composed of hydrogen and helium, but also contain traces of dust, ions, and molecules.",
