  "output": "An interesting game to play is one where players take turns trying to guess what their opponent is drawing. The player drawing is given a random topic and they must draw the required picture while their opponent must guess what the drawing is. The drawing player must be careful not to give away too many details as they draw while the guessing player has to use their deduction and observation skills to figure out what is being drawn. A correct guess ends the turn but an incorrect guess earns points for the other player. The game ends when a player reaches a specified number of points or if a time limit has been reached.",
