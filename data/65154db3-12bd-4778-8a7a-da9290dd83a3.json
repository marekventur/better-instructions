  "output": "Data storage for an online shopping website can be divided into two primary methods: traditional databases and cloud-based storage. A traditional database stores all the website\u2019s data on-site on a physical server and offers the best performance. However, it is often the most expensive option and provides limited scalability due to the physical limitations of the server. On the other hand, cloud-based storage stores data on a remote server, generally owned and maintained by a third-party provider. This method is typically more affordable, easier to set up, and more suitable for large websites. Additionally, cloud-based solutions offer unparalleled scalability and security, as data can be easily backed up, accessed, and managed from anywhere.",
