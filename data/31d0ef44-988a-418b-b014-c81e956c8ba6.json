  "instruction": "Describe the given political situation in 5-7 sentences.",
  "input": "The government of the United States is in a state of gridlock.",
  "output": "The government of the United States is currently in a state of gridlock due to the inability of the two major political parties to come to an agreement. This state of gridlock has led to the halting of certain key policies and decisions, leading to further deterioration of political stability. This gridlock also affects government actions such as passing laws which are necessary for the progress and development of the country. The gridlock is a result of the opposing views of the two major parties and the more extreme positions taken by each side. This has made an agreement between them increasingly difficult. As the gridlock continues, it is essential for the two major political parties to find compromise in order to bring the country out of this political crisis.",
