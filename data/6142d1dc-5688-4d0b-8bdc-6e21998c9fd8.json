  "output": "Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity is a description of the relationship between space, time and gravity. The two main concepts of the theory are relativity of motion and equality of inertial frames. In other words, the laws of physics must be the same in all reference frames including frames that are accelerating, and any physical event occurs the same for all observers regardless of the observer's state of motion. Additionally, the theory states that the speed of light is constant in any inertial frame. Einstein's work implies that time and space are curved, and that gravity is an effect of this curvature.",
