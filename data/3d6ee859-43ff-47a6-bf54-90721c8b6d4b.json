  "output": "Athens was an ancient city in Greece, which is now the capital of modern-day Greece. It was a powerful city-state in the classical period, ruling over much of the Mediterranean. Its legacy is visible in its archaeological sites such as the Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the fantastic marble structures of the Agora. It was a centre of art and culture, with plays and music popular among the citizens. It was well-known for its groundbreaking philosophical schools, most notably Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum. Athens was a great example of progress and intelligence in the ancient world, and its legacy still exists today.",
