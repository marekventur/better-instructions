  "instruction": "Generate a causal argument that explains why solar energy is preferable over coal.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Solar energy is a much more sustainable and Eco-friendly option than coal. It emits less pollutants into the atmosphere, requires less land for installation, and doesn\u2019t involve the burning of fossil fuels. Also, solar energy doesn\u2019t have the same health risks associated with it that coal does, such as asthma, cancer, and other respiratory illnesses. It also produces less noise pollution than coal and is cheaper to operate. Finally, by generating our power from solar energy, we can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy and become more self-sufficient.",
