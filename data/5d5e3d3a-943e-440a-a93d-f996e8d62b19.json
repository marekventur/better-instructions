  "instruction": "Come up with an exemplar for the phrase \"to think outside the box\".",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An example of thinking outside the box is to look for solutions to a problem from a different perspective. For example, instead of solving a math problem by following the traditional steps, one could try using a visualization technique or applying a creative approach to problem solving. By venturing into unchartered waters, one may be able to find new ideas that would not be possible by just following the same path every time.",
