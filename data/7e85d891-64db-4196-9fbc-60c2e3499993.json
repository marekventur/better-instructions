  "output": "The moral of the story \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\" is that words have consequences and should not be taken lightly. In the story, the townspeople of Hamelin made a promise to the Pied Piper and expected him to deliver on his promise for free, even though it cost him dearly. In the end, their decision caused the town to suffer greatly, proving that it is important to take promises seriously and think through the consequences before you make them.",
