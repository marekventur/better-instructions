  "input": "",
  "output": "The atmosphere is composed of five distinct layers: the troposphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere, the thermosphere, and the exosphere. The troposphere is closest to the Earth's surface and is where weather occurs. The stratosphere contains multiple layers, is known for having the ozone layer and is warmer than the troposphere. The mesosphere lies above the stratosphere and is even colder, while the thermosphere is the hottest layer. The exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere; it gradually fades into interplanetary space.",
