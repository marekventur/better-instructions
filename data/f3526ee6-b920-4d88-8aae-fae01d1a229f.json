  "output": "Sound has a profound effect on humans, from influencing our emotions to helping regulate our biological processes. Sound affects us both physically and mentally, with higher frequencies often causing us to feel alert and energized, while lower frequencies can act as a sedative and reduce anxiety. In addition, sound travels in waves which, when heard by humans, cause the auditory system to vibrate, leading to sounds being interpreted as speech or music.",
