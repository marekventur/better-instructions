A mesmerizing view of the Australian night sky embraces a mountain peak, a bare tree in the foreground surrounded by stillness. \n4. A mountain village seemingly in the middle of nowhere is surrounded by a blanket of golden light beneath a brilliant blue sky, a small, bright tree outlining the foreground.",
