  "output": "The events leading up to World War I began with rising tensions between the nations of Europe. These tensions increased when the countries of the Triple Entente (Britain, France, Russia) formed a military alliance and the countries of the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy) formed their own military alliance. Tensions escalated further when the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in 1914 by a Serbian nationalist led Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia. This declaration led to a chain reaction of declarations of war between the two military alliances, ultimately forming the conflict known as World War 1.",
