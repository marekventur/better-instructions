  "input": "",
  "output": "Humans have had a devastating effect on the elephant population in Africa over the last two decades. The main causes are poaching for ivory and meat, destruction of their habitat due to expanding human settlements and agriculture, and an inadequate level of enforcement of existing regulations and laws. As human populations expand and settlements and farms overrun the elephant's traditional habitats, their food and water sources become increasingly scarce. This in turn results in increased elephant-human conflict, as the animals appear close to settlements and farmland looking for food. Additionally, the demand for ivory has resulted in a significant increase in poaching, with the ivory trade being driven by illegal as well as legal activities. This has had a major impact on elephant population numbers, with some estimates suggesting a decrease of up to 30%-50% over the last two decades.",
