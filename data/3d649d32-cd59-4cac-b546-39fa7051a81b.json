  "output": "Friendship is a binding stronger\nThan any force like ropes or chains\nIt grows like grass and keeps us free\nFrom sorrow, pain and childish blames.\n\nIt travels in an invisible way\nMuch deeper than any eye can see\nLike a light that never fades away\nA bond that can never be broken, so strong that nothing can sway.\n\nFriendship tests us many times\nBut in the end it always feels sublime\nCrossing bridges of challenges\nTo be a faithful company all our life's days.",
