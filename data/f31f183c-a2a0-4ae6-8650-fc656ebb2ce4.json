  "output": "The most efficient way to cook chicken is using the oven. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F and then place the chicken on a baking sheet. Brush with oil and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165\u00b0F. This will typically take around 25 to 30 minutes. Be sure to check the internal temperature periodically.",
