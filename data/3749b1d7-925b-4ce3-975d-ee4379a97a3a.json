  "output": "I once had a frightening experience while walking through a dense forest at night. As I rounded a corner I was startled to find a large black bear standing just a few feet away, blocking my path and growling deeply at my presence. After a few moments of sheer terror, the bear eventually wandered away and I was able to continue on my way unscathed. But to this day I can still remember the feeling of that moment when I thought I might be in danger.",
