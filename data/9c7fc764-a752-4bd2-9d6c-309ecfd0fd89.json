  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Machine Learning can process data faster and more accurately than a human, making it an ideal tool for large-scale data analysis. \n2. Machine Learning is able to uncover hidden patterns in data as well as detect anomalies that may otherwise go unnoticed.\n3. Machine Learning can make decisions and predictions more efficiently, as it is not limited by the traditional rule-based algorithms of manual AI models.",
