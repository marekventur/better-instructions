  "instruction": "How would you explain the concept of artificial neural networks to someone without a technical background?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial neural networks are computer systems modeled after the human brain which can learn and make decisions on their own. They use a series of interconnected nodes and layers which can be trained to recognize patterns in data. These neural networks can be used to analyze complex data sets and make predictions based on their results.",
