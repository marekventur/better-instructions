  "input": "",
  "output": "Investing in gold can be a great way to diversify an investment portfolio and hedge against inflation. On the one hand, gold is a generally non-volatile asset and has been an excellent long term store of value. On the other hand, gold is a commodity and thus comes with a high degree of investment risk. Also, gold has historically been correlated with cyclical economic activity, which can create volatility in the short-term. Therefore, investors should be aware of the risks associated with investing in gold.",
