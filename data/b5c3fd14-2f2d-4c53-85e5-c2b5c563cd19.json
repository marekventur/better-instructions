  "input": "",
  "output": "1. When it's raining outside, it is ironic when someone decides to take an umbrella with them on their way out. This is ironic because it implies that they had knowledge of the fact that it was going to rain, while the rest of us had none.\n2. When a fire station catches on fire, it is ironic because they are the ones who are supposed to put out fires instead of causing them. \n3. When a doctor, who takes care of people's health, smokes cigarettes, it is ironic because smoking is proven to have adverse health effects.",
