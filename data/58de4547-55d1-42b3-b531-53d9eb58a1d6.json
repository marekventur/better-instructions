  "instruction": "Design a program that can recognize spoken words.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "This program should involve two components - a speech-to-text convertor and a language recognition module. The speech-to-text converter will take spoken words and convert them into text. The language recognition module will take the text and attempt to determine the language. It should involve using Natural Language Processing techniques such as tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stop word removal, and word embeddings. It should also involve using machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The program should be trained on a dataset of different languages and should be evaluated for accuracy.",
