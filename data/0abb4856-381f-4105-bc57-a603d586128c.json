  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of a successful negotiation was between the shareholders of a company and a potential buyer. The shareholders were trying to sell their stake in the company, but the buyer was offering a lower price than they had expected. To make the negotiation successful, the shareholders proposed a deal in which the buyer could purchase a minority stake in the company, giving them access to the company\u2019s technology and team but leaving the majority of control in the hands of the shareholders. In the end, the buyer was able to get access to the technology they wanted while the shareholders were able to retain control of the company. This was an effective negotiation because both sides were able to get what they wanted while avoiding a compromise.",
