  "output": "The best type of cheddar cheese to use on a cheese platter depends on your personal preference. For a mild and creamy flavor, a mild cheddar cheese is best. If you prefer a sharper, tangy flavor, an aged cheddar cheese is best. For a bold and intense flavor, an extra sharp cheddar cheese is best.",
