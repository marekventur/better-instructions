  "output": "Software as a Service (SaaS) is a model of software delivery in which a service provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the internet. The provider is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure and providing support and updates to the software. With SaaS, customers access the software using a web browser and pay for the service based on their usage.
