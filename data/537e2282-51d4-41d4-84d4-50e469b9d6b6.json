  "output": "The history of baseball in the United States dates back to the mid-1800s when early versions of the game were played in many parts of the country. The modern version of the game was developed in 1845 in Cooperstown, New York. Professional teams began to form in the 1860s and the National League was founded in 1876. The American League was founded in 1901 and the two leagues merged in 1903. The game has since become one of the most popular sports in the US, with numerous professional teams, college and youth leagues, and international exhibition games.",
