  "input": "",
  "output": "A templating language is a type of programming language designed to separate program logic from presentational elements. Templating languages allow developers to separate their code into distinct layers of presentation and data processing, making it easier to maintain their code long-term. Templating languages can also provide greater flexibility, as developers can use conditional logic to generate different output based on user input or other variables. Additionally, templating languages often include features like the ability to reuse components, which can make building websites or applications faster and simpler, and code-editing features, which can make code more accessible and easier to debug.",
