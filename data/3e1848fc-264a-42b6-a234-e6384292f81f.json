  "output": "Organic compounds are compounds that contain Carbon and Hydrogen, typically bonded together in long chains. Inorganic compounds are compounds that do not contain Carbon and Hydrogen and have different chemical structures. Organic compounds can be living organisms, while inorganic compounds are generally not living organisms. Organic compounds often have a lower melting point than inorganic compounds. Organic compounds are also more reactive than inorganic compounds.",
