  "input": "",
  "output": "The key components of a genetic algorithm are a population of candidate solutions, a fitness function used to assess the quality of these solutions, a selection process which selects high-performing solutions to be used in the next generation, a genetic variation operator which introduces diversity within the population, and a loop which continuously repeats the selection and variation steps until a certain condition or criteria is met.",
