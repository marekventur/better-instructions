  "output": "I recently visited Taco King and had a terrible experience. The overall atmosphere was uninviting and it seemed like the place hadn't been cleaned in a while. The service was also terrible; it took 15 minutes before our order was taken, and then 30 minutes more before the food arrived. The tacos were small and not very tasty, and the prices were too high for the quality of food. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal.",
