  "output": "John had just finished packing away his time capsule which he had dreamed of making for years. Inside the special wooden box were precious items from his past \u2013 a scrapbooking of his childhood, a few treasured photos of his teenage years, and a journal detailing his last two years of college. These items were going to be treasured artifacts in his future and he couldn\u2019t wait to open the box in ten years\u2019 time when he was ready to relive all his fond memories. He placed the box in the ground, buried it deep, so now all he could do was wait for the future to come.",
