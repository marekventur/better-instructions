  "input": "",
  "output": "Relational databases adhere to the principles of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID). Atomicity ensures that each transaction is an all-or-nothing operation; either all changes are committed, or none of them are. Consistency guarantees that a transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. Isolation ensures that a transaction cannot interfere with other transactions. Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its effects will remain, even if there is a system failure or restart.",
