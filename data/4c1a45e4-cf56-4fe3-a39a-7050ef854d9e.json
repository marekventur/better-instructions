  "output": "Tropical rainforests are lush, vibrant ecosystems characterized by high temperatures and abundant rainfall. They are home to a diverse range of animal species, from large cats to tiny amphibians. The canopy of the rainforest blocks out most of the sunlight, creating a unique environment of darkness and dampness that sustains a wide variety of plants. Additionally, the tall trees and dense foliage create a unique environment where moisture is trapped and constantly recycled.",
