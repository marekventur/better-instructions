  "output": "How about hosting an Earth Day Carnival to celebrate Earth Day? Have different carnival games such as a recycling relay race, an air pollution obstacle course, and a nature scavenger hunt. Offer food dishes made of sustainable, local ingredients, and provide educational booths that educate people on environmental issues. There could also be a special yoga session for those who don't want to play games. This carnival could be a fun and educational way to celebrate Earth Day.",
