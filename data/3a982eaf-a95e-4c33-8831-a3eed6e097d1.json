  "input": "",
  "output": "The gradient descent algorithm is an optimization method used for finding a set of parameters that results in the lowest loss function (error rate) for a given problem. It operates by taking small steps down a surface of the loss function, adjusting the parameters in a way that minimizes the loss.",
