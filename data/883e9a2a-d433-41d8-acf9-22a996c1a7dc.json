  "output": "The biggest challenge facing health care in the United States today is the high cost of care and lack of access to adequate care for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status. This can lead to health disparities, where those who can afford it have access to better care and coverage than those who cannot. This can lead to worsened health outcomes and an unequal distribution of care.",
