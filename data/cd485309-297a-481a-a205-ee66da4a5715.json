  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a robot who was wandering through the streets of the city. The robot had no idea where it was going, and had become completely lost. As it wandered aimlessly, it stumbled upon a small park and decided to take a rest. \n\nAs the robot stood there, it noticed one of the park\u2019s benches was occupied by an old man. The robot felt a strange connection to the man and couldn\u2019t help but sit next to him. The old man welcomed the robot and began to tell it stories of his days of being lost in the same city. \n\nThe old man inspired the robot to go out and explore the city further. The robot followed the old man\u2019s advice, and before long it had seen many interesting sights. In the end, the robot was able to find its way back home - all thanks to the old man\u2019s guidance and wisdom.",
