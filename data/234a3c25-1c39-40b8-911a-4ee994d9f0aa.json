  "output": "A ReLU activation function (Rectified Linear Unit) is a type of mathematical decision-making unit used in Artificial Neural Networks. It is a piecewise linear function that calculates the output of a given input node by mapping it to 0 if it is less than 0 or to a positive value otherwise. The ReLU activation function is one of the most commonly used activation functions for deep learning applications due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. Its main feature is to introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing for more intricate patterns to be detected.  It is also easy to compute and even easier to implement with software or hardware.  It's most notable applications are in the field of image-recognition and audio-processing.  ReLU enables the network to learn its own features, allowing for better predictions and increases in accuracy.  It speeds up training by reducing the vanishing gradient problem and improving generalization accuracy.  Overall, ReLU shows very good performance in practice and its simplicity makes it a popular choice.",
