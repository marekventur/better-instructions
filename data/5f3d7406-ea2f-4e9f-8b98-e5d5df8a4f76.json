  "input": "A successful sales pitch should engage the potential buyer.",
  "output": "A successful sales pitch should engage the potential buyer because engaging them helps build trust and rapport. When potential buyers are engaged, they are more likely to listen to the salesperson and understand the value and benefits offered by the product or service. An engaging sales pitch is also more likely to help the potential buyer come to a conclusion, as they are more likely to be actively participating in the conversation. Engaging potential buyers also helps salespeople gain insights on their potential customers and how to best tailor their pitch to their needs.",
