  "input": "",
  "output": "My plan of action for this new project would be to first create a clear and concise project brief that outlines the objectives and goals of the project. I would then build a team of the right people with the right skills to complete the project. After that, I would create a timeline and plan out the steps and deliverables needed to reach the project's objectives. I would then arrange periodic progress meetings, where I would take feedback from the team and adjust the timeline as needed. Lastly, I would complete the project by making sure all the deliverables have been met and tasks completed.",
