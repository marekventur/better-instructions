  "output": "Regeneration in plants involves the process of re-growth or repair of damaged or lost body parts. This can occur by external means, such as budding, or by internal means, such as cell division. During regeneration, a single cell or groups of cells divide and differentiate into new tissues or organs, while growth factors and hormones control the direction of development. The exact process and the speed at which it takes place vary depending on the type of plant.",
