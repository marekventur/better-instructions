  "input": "",
  "output": "Digital wallets are an effective way to improve financial inclusion. By using digital wallets, users can access financial services with minimal paperwork and without the need for a bank account. This makes it easier for marginalized populations, including low-income individuals, unbanked people, and refugees, to access financial services. Digital wallets also offer users more control over their finances, and provide enhanced security and convenience. Additionally, digital wallets allow users to access a wider range of financial services like remittances, foreign currency exchange, and direct payments, which can be beneficial for people living in developing countries or in remote areas with limited access to traditional financial services.",
