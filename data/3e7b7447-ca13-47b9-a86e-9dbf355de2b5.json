  "output": "Globalization has had a major positive impact on the economic growth of developing countries. By opening up markets and increasing the flow of capital, labor, goods and services, it has helped to reduce poverty and create new job opportunities. It has also enabled developing countries to integrate with the global economy, allowing them to access advanced technologies and attract foreign investment. \n\nThe economic growth of developing countries has been further boosted by global trade rules and agreements, which have opened up markets, reduced tariffs, and made it easier for businesses to access new markets. In addition, foreign aid has helped to reduce poverty and boost economic growth. \n\nIn conclusion, globalization has had a significant impact on the economic growth of developing countries, through increases in trade, foreign investment and access to advanced technologies.",
