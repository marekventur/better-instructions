  "input": "",
  "output": "The musical composition is a jazz piece featuring a traditional jazz rhythm section of piano, bass and drum. The melodic content is based on a blues scale and its movement creates a sense of contrast and contrast between solos and accompaniment. The composition follows a standard jazz structure with two choruses of 8 bars each and a modulation to A major for the bridge section. The piece ends with a flurry of 32nd notes in the piano and a final cadence in A major.",
