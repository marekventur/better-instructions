  "input": "",
  "output": "3D printing is a process of making three-dimensional solid objects from a digital file. It is achieved using additive processes, where successive layers of material are laid down in different shapes. 3D printing involves using a 3D model as a template and then adding successive layers of material, such as plastic, metal, or ceramic, until the final model is achieved. The modelling is achieved using Computer Assisted Drawing (CAD) software, where the 3D model is created and digitally stored.",
