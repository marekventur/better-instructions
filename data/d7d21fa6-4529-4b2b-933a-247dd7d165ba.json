  "output": "The Earth's climate has changed dramatically in the past century. Average global temperatures have risen significantly, resulting in increased extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and melting polar ice caps. There have also been changes in precipitation levels, ocean acidification, and changes in ocean circulation patterns. Most of these changes are linked to increased emissions of carbon dioxide, which is a result of human activities.",
