  "input": "",
  "output": "Three negative consequences of global warming are sea level rise, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and disruption of ecosystems. Sea level rise occurs when the Earth's atmosphere and oceans warm, causing oceanic water to expand and raise global sea levels. Increasingly extreme weather events like stronger storms and heat waves are also becoming more common due to global warming. Lastly, natural ecosystems around the world are being disrupted by global warming, leading to species extinctions, changes in migratory patterns, and habitat loss.",
