  "instruction": "Create a program that will detect similarities between two short texts.",
  "input": "Text 1: The phone rang loudly as I answered it.\nText 2: I picked up the ringing phone.",
  "output": "The program will detect similarities between the two texts. It will compare the words and phrases used in each text and create a score based on the number of times a word or phrase is repeated in both texts. It will also look for other features such as length, structure and syntax. The program will then assign a similarity score to the two texts.",
