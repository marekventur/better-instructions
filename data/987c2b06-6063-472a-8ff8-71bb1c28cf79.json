  "input": "",
  "output": "The Moon appears to change its shape because it is orbiting around Earth. The Moon's shape changes as different parts of its illuminated side become visible to observers on Earth throughout the lunar cycle. At any given time, we are only able to see the illuminated half of the Moon due to the way sunlight reflects off of it and, as the Moon orbits Earth, different amounts of illuminated surface become visible, giving the Moon its distinct \"phases\" over the course of the month.",
