  "input": "A manufacturing process in a factory that has low productivity",
  "output": "To optimize the manufacturing process, the first step should be to analyze the process to identify areas of inefficiency. This could involve gathering data on the process and conducting a cost/benefit analysis to determine where improvements could be made. Based on the findings, recommendations can be made to increase productivity, such as introducing new technology or streamlining processes.",
