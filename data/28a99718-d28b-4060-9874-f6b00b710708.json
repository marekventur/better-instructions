  "input": "",
  "output": "We can use the following algorithm to determine whether a given number, n, is prime or not:\n1. Set a counter, i, to 2.\n2. Check if n is evenly divisible by i. If n is evenly divisible by i, n is not a prime number. If n is not evenly divisible by i, increment i by 1 and go back to Step 2.\n3. If i is greater than or equal to the square root of n, then n is a prime number.",
