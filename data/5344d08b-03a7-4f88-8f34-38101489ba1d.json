  "instruction": "Write a news article about gender diversity in computing.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A recent report conducted by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) has revealed that gender diversity in computing has not improved over the last decade. The report attributed the lack of progress to gender stereotypes, lack of access to learning opportunities, and unequal representation. Women in computing face an uphill battle for advancement, as well as workplace discrimination and biases. Despite the gender gap, the report concluded that computing is still one of the most lucrative and important fields for a successful career. Companies are being encouraged to take initiatives to end gender inequality, such as providing equal access to learning opportunities and recruiting more female applicants. By increasing gender diversity in computing, the industry can benefit from a larger pool of talent and expertise. This will open the door to more innovation and creativity in the field.",
