Johnson's key finding: when diverse ideas, workflows, people, and rapidly changing priorities interact with one another, just like in a crowded city, creative solutions arise. Johnson calls these highly creative, interdisciplinary locations adaptive hotbeds and believes that these hotbeds are responsible for many of the world\u2019s most ground-breaking innovations.",
