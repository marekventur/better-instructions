  "output": "To recycle paper products, it is important to first collect and separate the materials. Separate items such as magazines, newspaper, cardboard, office paper, and envelopes. Once items are sorted, place them in a paper recycling bin and take it to a local paper recycling plant for processing. At the plant, the paper will be sorted, baled, and sent to the paper mill where it will be recycled into new paper products.",
