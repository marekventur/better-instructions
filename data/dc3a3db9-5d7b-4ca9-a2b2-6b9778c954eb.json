  "input": "",
  "output": "The ancient Egyptians used primitive tools and large teams of workers to lift and move the massive limestone blocks necessary for building the Great Pyramid. These blocks were believed to have come from nearby quarries and were then transported by barge and sledges over rivers, lakes, and deserts to the construction site. It is estimated that the pyramid took 20-30 years for completion and involved hundreds of thousands of workers.",
