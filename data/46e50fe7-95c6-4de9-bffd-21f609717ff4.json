  "input": "No input",
  "output": "The waterfall model is a linear software development process that follows distinct phases of development. The phases are as follows: Requirement Analysis, Design, Implementation/Coding, Integration, System Testing, and Maintenance. During the Requirement Analysis phase, the customer's needs are identified and documented. The Design phase involves designing the architecture, algorithms, and interfaces. The Implementation/Coding phase involves writing and testing the actual code. The Integration phase involves combining individual modules into a complete system. The System Testing involves testing the full system and ensuring it meets the customer's requirements. The Maintenance phase involves fixing any bugs that have been found and responding to changes in customer requirements.",
