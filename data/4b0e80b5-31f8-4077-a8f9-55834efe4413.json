  "output": "Here are 3 differences between data science and artificial intelligence: \n1. Data Science focuses on the analysis of datasets while Artificial Intelligence focuses on the development of intelligent machines that can learn and solve problems.\n2. Data Science relies on statistical techniques such as regression and clustering while Artificial Intelligence relies on Machine Learning algorithms such as Neural Networks and Deep Learning. \n3. Data Science is focused on understanding and interpreting the data while Artificial Intelligence is focused on creating models and algorithms to solve complex problems.",
