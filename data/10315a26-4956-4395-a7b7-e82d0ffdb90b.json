  "input": "",
  "output": "The works of Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol are distinctive in their own rights. Picasso's works are characterized by the use of vibrant colors and bold lines, featuring cubist and surrealist elements. He often drew and painted objects and scenes out of proportion, using a mix of geometric abstractions and symbols to convey meaning. Warhol's works feature bright colors and graphic shapes and are heavily influenced by pop art. He often incorporated images of celebrities, everyday objects and current events to address topics of popular culture, consumerism and mass production.",
