  "output": "The Cuban Missile Crisis was a major confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It occurred in October 1962 and is considered one of the most critical moments of the Cold War due to the potential for nuclear conflict. The crisis was sparked by the discovery of Soviet-supplied nuclear missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles off the American coast. In response, the U.S. imposed a naval blockade on Cuba and threatened a full-scale invasion. After two weeks of tense negotiations, a deal was reached that involved the removal of all Soviet missiles from Cuba, in exchange for the withdrawal of American missiles from Turkey. The resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis resulted in a major relief of international tensions and led to the implementation of nuclear-arms agreements that further reduced the risk of a global nuclear conflict.",
