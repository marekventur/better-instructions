  "input": "",
  "output": "In this system, people can gain points by participating in community service activities. Points are awarded for the amount of time spent doing community service and the level of difficulty of the activities. Some activities, such as volunteering to clean up a park or help at a homeless shelter, can be worth more points. \n\nPoints can be redeemed for rewards such as discounts or gift cards. The points can also be donated to charities or used to support individuals who are doing community service. \n\nBy participating in community service, people can gain not only points, but also make a positive contribution to their community by helping those in need. It will also increase people's sense of well-being and fulfilment.\n\nCertain objectives can be set up as a requirement in order to receive points. For example, a volunteer might need to contribute a minimum amount of hours each month in order to receive the full number of points.\n\nOverall, a system like this can help to encourage people to become more involved in their communities, develop positive relationships with their neighbours, and lead to a healthier and happier society.",
