  "input": "",
  "output": "The law of supply and demand states that when demand for a product increases, the price of the good increases as well, and vice versa. Additionally, as the price of a good increases, producers will increase the supply (or availability) of the good. Conversely, when the price of a good drops, producers will decrease the supply, as the lower price is not as profitable for them. The law of supply and demand explains the interaction between the supply of a good and the demand for that good and how prices are affected by the interaction.",
