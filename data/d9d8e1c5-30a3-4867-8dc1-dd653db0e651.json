  "input": "",
  "output": "Bisecting a line segment is the process of dividing it into two equal halves. To bisect a line segment, you need two points on the line segment, A and B. Draw a line perpendicular to the line segment at point A and extend it through point B. This is the line that will represent the bisector of the line segment. Draw a circle using point A as the center and a radius of half of the line segment, this will intersect the perpendicular line at a midpoint, C. Lastly, draw a line from point A to point C and from point B to point C. This will create two equal line segments, each with the same length bisected by the perpendicular line.",
