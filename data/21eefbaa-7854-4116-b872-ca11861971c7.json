  "output": "A student's daily routine should include plenty of sleep, balanced meals, physical activity, and academic work. Immediately after waking up, spend thirty minutes doing light stretches and other physical activities, such as taking a brisk walk. Then, eat a nutritious breakfast and get ready for school. During school, arrive on time and participate in class activities. After school, it is recommended to take a short break before engaging in academic activities like homework and exam preparation. In the evening, have a healthy dinner, then allot time for leisure activities like reading a book, playing an instrument, and speaking with friends and family. Before going to bed, review the day's accomplishments and plan for the following day.",
