  "input": "",
  "output": "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of rules for exchanging files over the internet. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. HTTP is stateless, meaning each command is executed independently, without knowledge of the commands that came before it.",
