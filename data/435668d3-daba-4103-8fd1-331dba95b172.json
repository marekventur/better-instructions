  "input": "Some people come into our lives and quickly go.",
  "output": "Some people come into our lives for just a short while, \nYet in a moment, friendship can bring a happy smile. \nSometimes footsteps come and go like the ocean waves, \nBut true friends never part, in friendship forever it lays. \nSo cherish the moments you share with friends so profound, \nFor friendship is the greatest love that can't be bound.",
