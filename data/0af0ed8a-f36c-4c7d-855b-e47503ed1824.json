  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a young girl in a small village deep in a secluded wood. The village was filled with beautiful greenery and people of all ages living side by side. But behind all of that beauty, the village was keeping a big secret. It was said that the village was home to a mythical creature, living deep below the village and only coming out at night. No one knew what kind of creature it was, but they knew they had to keep it safe and hidden.\n\nFor years the villagers had a secret agreement that they would protect the creature and not tell anyone about it. They would hunt for it in the night and offer it food, but never dared to speak of it during the day. But one day a curious young girl found the secret and began to tell everyone about it.\n\nNo one knew what would happen when the secret was out, but the villagers didn't have time to find out. Before long, the creature had disappeared, never to be seen again. Even though the creature was gone, the myth still lives on in the village and its secret lives on too.",
