  "instruction": "Tell me how the given two items are different.",
  "input": "Cat : Dog",
  "output": "Cats and dogs are different in many ways. Cats are more independent, prefer to live alone, and are agile climbers. Dogs are more social animals, tend to prefer the company of other canines, and are strong diggers. Cats have sharp claws that they use for climbing and self-defence. Dogs have large noses and stronger sense of smell. Cats can be litter box-trained and dogs can be house-trained. They require different care and training, so it is important to research the needs of both animals before making a commitment.",
