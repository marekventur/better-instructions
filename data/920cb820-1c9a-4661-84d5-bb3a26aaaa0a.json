  "input": "",
  "output": "A mobile application can be designed to display the weather forecast by retrieving data from a trusted weather API. The application should include a home page with weather information for the user's current location, along with the ability to search for the forecast of other locations. The forecast should display the current conditions, temperature, and wind speeds, as well as a visual representation of the forecast for the next few days. The application should also be able to track a user's favorite locations for quick reference.",
