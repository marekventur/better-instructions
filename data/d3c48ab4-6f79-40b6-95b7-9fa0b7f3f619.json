  "output": "Online classes have revolutionized the way of learning and teaching. In the Covid-19 pandemic, they have allowed teaching and learning to continue despite the imposed physical restrictions. But do online classes really have the same efficacy as traditional in-person instruction? This essay will argue that despite being highly convenient, online classes fail to provide the depth and quality of instruction as would be provided if instruction was conducted in person. \n\nOne major problem with online classes is the lack of in-person interaction between students and instructors. Offline classes are highly beneficial in that instructors are able to guide students through their work, answer any questions, and catch any mistakes. Without physical presence, students can struggle to understand their work and don't have access to any support from their instructor. Moreover, in classes such as lab sciences, online students don't have access to the practical demonstrations and thus, fully understand the lab material. Furthermore, students who take online classes are more likely to be more distant from the subject matter and may tend to procrastinate and be less attentive in class, almost completely mitigating any advantage of the class being online instead of in person. \n\nIn conclusion, online classes have come as a handy tool to continue teaching during times of crisis. But they still fail to provide the necessary depth and quality of instruction as compared to traditional in-person ones. The lack of physical presence of instructors and students and lack of in-person access to demonstrations both have a negative effect on online classes' efficacy, thus making them less effective as compared to in-person classes.",
