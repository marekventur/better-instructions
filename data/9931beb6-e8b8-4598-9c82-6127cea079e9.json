  "output": "Climate change has implications for both the environment and society. Increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, ocean acidification, and sea level rise are all expected to increase as the planet warms. This will lead to increased threats to public health, infrastructure, wild species, and natural resources. In addition, these threats will be amplified by the effects of other environmental issues such as habitat loss, deforestation, and inadequate water management.",
