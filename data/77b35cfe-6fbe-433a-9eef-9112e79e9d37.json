  "instruction": "Construct an algorithm to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.",
  "input": "3, 8, 5, 1, 9",
  "output": "Start with the first number - in the given list, 3 is the first number. Then compare the first number with the second number - compare 3 with 8 - and if the first number is larger, swap the numbers. In this case, 8 is larger than 3, so no swapping is needed. Then, compare 8 with the third number - 5. In this case, 5 is smaller than 8, so 8 and 5 will be swapped and the first three numbers in the list will now be sorted. Repeat this process with the rest of the numbers, resulting in the sorted list: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9.",
