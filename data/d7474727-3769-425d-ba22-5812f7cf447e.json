  "output": "I would recommend a refreshing smoothie for a hot summer day. You can make your own smoothie by blending up your favorite fresh fruits, such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and/or bananas. To make the smoothie extra refreshing, add a few tablespoons of plain Greek yogurt and some ice cubes. Finally, as a finishing touch, you can even add a splash of orange or pineapple juice to give the smoothie a sweet citrusy flavor. Enjoy!",
