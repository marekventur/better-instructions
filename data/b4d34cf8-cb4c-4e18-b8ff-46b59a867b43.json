  "output": "Working in a team offers several advantages. Teams allow individuals to share their talents, knowledge, and ideas, which can lead to more creative solutions than could have been achieved by an individual alone. Additionally, having multiple sets of eyes on a task can help ensure accuracy and stability, while sharing the workload can ensure that tasks are completed in a timely manner. Finally, with the help of a team, tasks that may be challenging for an individual can become manageable, as each team member is able to learn from one another as well as provide emotional support.",
