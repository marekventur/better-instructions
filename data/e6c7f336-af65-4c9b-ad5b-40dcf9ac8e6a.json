  "output": "Waves move by the transfer of energy. The energy of a wave is the result of a disturbance moving through a medium, like when a person drops a pebble into a pond and the ripples move outward. Waves move in a repeating pattern, where the transmission of energy from one point to the next results in a transfer of the wave form. Waves can also appear to move when particles vibrate back and forth. In both cases, the energy is transmitted from one place to the next, creating the wave movement.",
