  "input": "",
  "output": "The biological diversity found in organic farming provides a robust ecosystem that encourages strong root systems and access to more nutrients and minerals. Additionally, organic farms tend to use natural fertilizers, providing natural nutrients to encourage healthy plant growth. By avoiding the use of synthetic chemical formulations found in most conventional farming practices, organic farming may protect the soil from depleted minerals, thus providing more nutrients for the plants and making them more nutritious for consumption.",
