  "output": "Magnets are objects that produce magnetic fields. They have two poles, north and south, and magnetic fields flow from the north pole to the south pole. Magnets strongly attract metals containing iron, such as steel and nickel. Magnets can also attract and repel each other. They can be used to generate electricity and to store information. The strength of a magnet depends on its material composition and the number of magnetic domains it contains.",
