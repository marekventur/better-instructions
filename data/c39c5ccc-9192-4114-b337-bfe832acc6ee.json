  "output": "The chilled air in autumn, so crisp and clear,\nA reminder that summertime has disappeared.\nThe insects of summer, so free and wild,\nReturn home to their hideaways quite mild.\n\nThe trees reach for the sky, no leaves to be seen,\nReds, yellows and oranges of varied hues gleaned. \nThe weather gets colder, warm drinks are a must,\nThe days get shorter and the night evermore thrust.\n\nThe changing of seasons, bringing hand in hand,\nBeauty of the moon in its waning stand. \nSnowflakes come floating down in blessing mirth,\nAutumn a celebration of life on the earth.",
