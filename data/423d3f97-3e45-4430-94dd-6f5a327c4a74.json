  "output": "Why not encourage your child to take a road trip to a nearby city and explore their favorite museums, galleries and parks? En route, they can make a scavenger hunt to help them identify landmarks, funny signs and anything else they find along the way. When they arrive, they can document their journey with photos and a journal full of memories they can look back on later.",
