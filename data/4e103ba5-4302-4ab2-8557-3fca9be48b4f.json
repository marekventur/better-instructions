  "output": "A black hole is an area in space that is so powerful and dense that not even light can escape its pull. Black holes are like the opposite of stars- instead of giving off light, they absorb everything, even light. Scientists know black holes exist because they can see the way that they affect stars and other matter around them. It\u2019s kind of like a giant vacuum that sucks in and traps anything nearby, like a giant bottomless pit in space.",
