  "input": "",
  "output": "The main argument for why colleges should lower tuition costs is that it would be beneficial to students who may not have access to higher education due to the cost. Lowering tuition costs would make college more accessible to students from lower income backgrounds, allowing them to achieve the same educational opportunities as their higher-income peers. This would have a direct impact on decreasing inequality and increasing social mobility.",
