  "input": "",
  "output": "The statement that the internet has no boundaries is not entirely accurate. While it is easy to access information from anywhere in the world, the internet is subject to various restrictions, censorship and regulation depending on the country. Furthermore, the internet is often divided into various subnets, or regions, which further add walls that divide the network. As such, while the internet may seem boundless, its ability to connect people can be limited.",
