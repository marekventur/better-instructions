  "input": "",
  "output": "The str.add() method in Python is used to add two or more strings together. It takes two or more string arguments and returns a new string which is the concatenation of the input strings, that is, the strings are combined and joined in the order they were specified. The two input arguments don\u2019t necessarily have to be of the same type as long as they are compatible and can be converted, for example, if one argument is an integer, it will be converted to a string before being added. The str.add() function is a useful way to join multiple strings together in Python.",
