  "instruction": "Show how to estimate the area of the following shape.",
  "input": "Two rectangles and a triangle are connected, as shown in the image.",
  "output": "To estimate the area of the given shape, first calculate the areas of the two rectangles and add them together. Then, calculate the area of the triangle by multiplying the length of its base by its height and divide by 2. Finally, add the area of the two rectangles and the area of the triangle to get the estimated area of the given shape.",
