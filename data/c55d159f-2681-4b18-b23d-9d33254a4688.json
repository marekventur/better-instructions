  "input": "",
  "output": "Step 1: Obtain a list of cars and their prices. Step 2: Create a classification system based on the price of the cars. For example, cars with a price below $20,000 could be classified as \"budget\", cars priced between $20,000 and $50,000 as \"mid-range\", and cars with a price over $50,000 as \"luxury\". Step 3: For each car, compare its price to the prices in the classification system.  Step 4: Assign a label to each car according to the classification system. Step 5: Output the list of cars with the assigned label.",
