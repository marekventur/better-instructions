  "input": "",
  "output": "Social media has become an integral part of modern society and its effect on teenagers is undeniable. While it presents opportunities for the exploration of new ideas and increasing social connection, it can also be detrimental to the mental health of teenagers. Excessive exposure to social media can lead to feelings of disconnection, low self-esteem, and anxiety as a result of comparison and oversharing.Social media can also negatively influence young people by exposing them to a range of content and activities such as cyberbullying, sexting and online predators. On the other hand, when used responsibly, social media can have some positive effects on teenagers. It can be used as an instrument of self-expression, connecting with peers, engaging in conversations and knowledge sharing, and engaging in creative activities and interests.",
