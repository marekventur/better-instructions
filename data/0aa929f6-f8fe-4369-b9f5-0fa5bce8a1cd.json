  "input": "A new student arrives at school during a pandemic.",
  "output": "It was the start of the school year, but nothing felt normal. Everyone was required to wear masks in the hallways, and the new student felt out of place as she walked down the empty corridor. She was the only new student in the school, and she had arrived late due to the pandemic. \n\nThe student timidly opened the door to her first class and was relieved to see the other students were wearing masks as well. Everyone looked up as she entered and gave her a welcome nod. She found a seat in the back and tried to blend in with the rest of the class.\n\nThe teacher asked if anyone had any questions about the new student and the class went silent. No one wanted to make eye contact, almost as if the pandemic had created a barrier that was hard to breach. The student felt awkward and uncontrollably looked around the hallway. \n\nFinally, the bell rang, and the student scrambled to her feet. Out of nowhere, a friendly voice said \u201cHi, I\u2019m Sam! I\u2019d be happy to show you around at lunch.\u201d The student smiled and without a second thought accepted the offer. \n\nLater at lunch, Sam encouraged everyone to have a conversation and make the new student feel comfortable. The silence was still there, but slowly one by one, the students started to join in until the atmosphere resembled something of normalcy. \n\nThe pandemic had created an uncomfortable transition for the new student, yet with Sam\u2019s help, she felt confident to explore her new surroundings and confidently make friends at school.",
