  "output": "It was a typical night in the city. People were walking the streets, cars honking, music playing - nothing out of the ordinary. But what no one knew was that this night was about to be anything but typical. As they moved through the city, they began to notice that something was a bit off. One by one, pieces of the city were disappearing - buildings, parks, public transportation - all gone. No one knew where it was going, or what was causing it to happen, and it seemed like each minute the city was fading away one piece at a time. Eventually, the day came when there was nothing left but an endless void of blackness. It was a mystery that no one could explain.",
