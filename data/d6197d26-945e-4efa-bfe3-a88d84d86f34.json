  "input": "",
  "output": "Infographic design relies heavily on striking visuals and colors to convey information in an attention-grabbing way. When choosing colors, designers consider visual cues, such as contrast and balance, to illustrate data points and structure the design. They often use analogous colors to create organically flowing visuals, while using shades of the same color can be used to create a cohesive design and highlight important pieces of information.",
