  "output": "The sinking of the Titanic was one of the most devastating maritime disasters in history. On April 15th, 1912, the illustrious luxury liner set sail on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, bound for New York City. Despite being touted as the \"unsinkable\" ship, the Titanic struck an iceberg and sunk in the early morning hours of the 15th. It took over two hours for the ship to completely disappear beneath the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. Over 1,500 souls were lost, and the disaster shocked the world. To this day, the tragedy of the Titanic serves as a somber reminder of the power of the sea and the fragility of human life.",
