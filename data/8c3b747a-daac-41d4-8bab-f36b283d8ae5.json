  "input": "Tree Pruning and Tree Removal",
  "output": "Tree pruning is the process of selectively removing branches and stems from a tree to maintain its health and aesthetics. It involves careful cutting of the tree to retain its shape, while also encouraging growth. Tree removal involves completely removing a tree from an area. It can be done for a variety of reasons, including if the tree is unhealthy, poses safety risks, or is too large for the area that it is in.",
