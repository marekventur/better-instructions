On the left section, there is one bar showing a number indicating the overall energy usage in kilowatt-hours for residential users, while the right section contains a similar bar showing the energy usage for commercial users. The two bars are of different heights to illustrate their relative energy usage. The numbers for each energy usage type are indicated above their respective bars.
