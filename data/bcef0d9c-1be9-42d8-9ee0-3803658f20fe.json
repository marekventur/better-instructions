  "output": "Cameras are made up of several components that work together to capture the image. These components include the lens, shutter, aperture, sensor, viewfinder, and other components such as the exposure, focus, and flash. The lens is responsible for focusing light onto the camera\u2019s sensor, while the shutter regulates how much light is in the shot. The aperture controls the amount of light that passes through the lens, while the sensor captures the digital image. The viewfinder is used to compose the image and display it, while the other components help adjust the settings to get the right exposure.",
