  "output": "Once upon a time there was a knight who loved his shield. He treasured it like nothing else, until one day his loved one took the shield away. Devastated, he was left to wander aimlessly. \n\nOne day while wandering, he came upon a magnificent castle. But upon closer inspection he realized that the castle was surrounded by broken glass. Peering inside, he could see white horses carrying a new king. \nHe remembered that this kingdom did not accept outsiders, so he decided to stay on the outskirts. Maybe he would be able to figure out a way to reclaim his shield. \nHe planned to stay for as long as it takes to get his shield back.",
