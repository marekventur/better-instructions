  "output": "Wearing a face mask can help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. It protects both the wearer and those around them from potential harm. Wearing a mask can reduce the risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. It decreases the amount of droplets we spread when we speak, sneeze, or cough. It also prevents us from touching our face and thereby reducing the risk of transmission. In addition, wearing a mask has psychological benefits as it creates a collective effort that encourages us to recognize our shared responsibility in protecting ourselves and others. Lastly, it promotes social connection by setting a positive example, normalizing the wearing of masks and creating a sense of solidarity.",
