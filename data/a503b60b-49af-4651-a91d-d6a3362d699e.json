  "input": "",
  "output": "A convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) is a type of feed-forward artificial neural network in which the connectivity pattern between its neurons is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex. In a ConvNet, neurons in the earlier layers have large receptive fields, allowing the network to capture patterns in spatial data such as images. By using multiple filtered images as an input, a ConvNet can learn to differentiate between various objects in images and classify them based on the content of the image.",
