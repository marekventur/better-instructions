  "output": "One sustainable way to reduce single-use plastics is to switch to reusable alternatives such as stainless steel straws, reusable cloth bags and ceramic coffee mugs. Additionally, you could purchase items that are packaged in compostable, biodegradable materials or opt for products or produce that does not require any packaging. You could also look for local programs or organizations that accept and recycle plastic items.",
