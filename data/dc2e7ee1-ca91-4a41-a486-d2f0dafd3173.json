  "output": "Quantum computing is a relatively new and fast-developing field of science which has the potential to revolutionize computing. The core concept of quantum computing is that information can be processed and stored in a quantum state, whereby it can be manipulated with greater speed and accuracy than is possible with classical computers.\n\nThe stages of quantum computing involve the following: Preparation, Transformation, Measurement, Error Correction and Scalability. Preparation stage is where the suitable qubits (quantum bits) are set up to perform operations. Transformation is where the qubits are manipulated in order to solve the given problem. Measurement is the stage where the results and outcomes are observed, analyzed and interpreted. Error Correction is the stage where errors which can arise from manipulation of qubits are addressed. Lastly Scalability is the stage where to enhance the performance of quantum computers the amount of qubits are increased.",
