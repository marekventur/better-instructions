  "output": "The four stages of natural selection are variation, heritability, selection, and adaptation. Variation occurs when individuals in a species have unique attributes. Heritability is the transfer of a trait from parents to their offspring. Selection is the process of different traits becoming more abundant or rare in a population depending on the environment. Finally, adaptation is when heritable traits that are advantageous become more common in a population.",
