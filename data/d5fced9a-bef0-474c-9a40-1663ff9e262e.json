  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a family of three: a father, a mother, and their young son. They lived in a small house in a quiet village, where they were happy and comfortable. Every night, the father would tell stories to his son of the adventures they could have in far-off lands, and the son wished he could travel the world one day. \nBut one day, tragedy struck and the father passed away suddenly. The mother tried to carry on as best she could, but nothing could fill the emptiness in the house. The son, however, remembered his father's stories, and dedicated himself to making them come true. With the help of his mother, he set out on his own adventure and proved that it was possible to find joy and new beginnings amidst sadness.",
