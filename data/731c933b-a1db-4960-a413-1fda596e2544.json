  "output": "1. Cats' whiskers are extremely sensitive and are used to help them navigate in the dark or locate potential prey.\n2. A domestic cat can sprint up to 31 miles per hour.\n3. Cats have an incredibly powerful sense of smell and can smell up to 100 times better than humans.\n4. Cats are able to survive falls from great heights by righting themselves and landing on their feet.\n5. A cat's heart beats nearly twice as fast as a human heart.\n6. Cats can jump up to 5 times their own height.\n7. Cats groom themselves primarily with their tongue, which has tiny barbs on the end to help remove dirt and debris.\n8. Cats can make over 100 different sounds, while humans and dogs can both only make around 10.\n9. Cats sweat through the pads of their feet rather than through their skin.\n10. Cats have twice as many neurons in the somatosensory region of the brain, meaning they have an exceptionally strong sense of touch.",
