  "instruction": "What problems could arise if a software development team does not have a tester?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Without a tester on the software development team, the code may have bugs that are not detected, leading to poor quality and unreliable software. Additionally, the software could have bugs that are not identified during testing, which could cause the software to crash or malfunction in production. Furthermore, the lack of a tester can lead to a lack of consistent feedback and communication, which can delay or cause the software to have delays in development cycles. Finally, the software may lack extensibility or scalability and may lack optimization for performance.",
