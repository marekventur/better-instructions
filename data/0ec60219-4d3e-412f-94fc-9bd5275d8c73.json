  "input": "",
  "output": "Individual performance is related to the actions and decisions made by individuals while societal performance focuses on the actions and decisions of an entire group or organization. Individual performance is more focused on the needs and goals of the individual while societal performance is based on collective goals. Individual performance can be more easily measured and quantified while measuring the impact of societal performance can be more difficult as it usually involves evaluating the individual components making up the larger picture.",
