  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change affects agriculture in a number of ways. One of the primary ways is through more extreme and unpredictable weather patterns, as well as increased prevalence of extreme weather events, like droughts and floods. This can cause crops to be destroyed, leading to decreased yields. Additionally, warmer temperatures can result in reduced water availability, as well as create an environment conducive to the spread of pest and diseases. Lastly, a shift in the length of the growing season can have an effect on crops, as certain crops may no longer fit in the local growing environment. All of this can lead to food insecurity and economic stress, as farmers and producers struggle to cope with the economic costs associated with climate change.",
