  "input": "",
  "output": "The phrase \u201ctime is money\u201d is meaningful because it is an expression of how valuable time is. We can never get back time once it has passed, so it's important to use our time wisely and efficiently. Every minute of our time is valuable, as it corresponds with a potential opportunity or task that we could be working on or undertaking. Using our time wisely and efficiently is a key component in maximizing productivity, and thus money, in our lives.",
