  "input": "",
  "output": "We learn new languages for a variety of reasons. Learning a new language can open doors to cultural experiences and opportunities. It can also be beneficial when travelling, since it allows us to communicate with locals. Additionally, learning a new language can help improve our communication and critical thinking skills, as well as our overall cognitive abilities. Finally, learning a foreign language can be a fun and rewarding experience that can help us better understand our own language.",
