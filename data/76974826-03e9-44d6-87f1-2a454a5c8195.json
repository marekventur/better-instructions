  "output": "Rain is a type of weather that is caused by moisture in the atmosphere condensing into droplets. Rain usually falls from gray, dark clouds and is usually accompanied by thunder and lightning. Heavy rains bring strong gusts of wind and sometimes hail. It is often a cooler form of weather with temperatures cooling down during periods of heavy rainfall.\n\nRain can last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours depending on the intensity and length of the storm. In areas where rains are especially common, buildings and roads are designed to be resistant to water damage.\n\nRain is a type of precipitation vital for plant growth and a natural water source for many organisms. It is also an important resource for hydropower, agriculture, and industry. Rain has beneficial effects such as cleansing the air and suppressing the dust, but can have drawbacks such as causing floods and road closures.",
