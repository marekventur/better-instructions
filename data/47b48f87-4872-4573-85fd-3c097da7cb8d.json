  "output": "The Amazon River is the largest in terms of volume, discharging around two and a half times more water than the River Nile. It is the second longest river on Earth, stretching around 4,000 miles, and is located primarily in South America. In comparison, the Yangtze River is the longest river in Asia, and is 3,900 miles in length. Both rivers flow in a mostly east-west direction, with the Amazon traveling further south and theYangtze further north. While the Amazon River has over 1,100 tributaries, the Yangtze River has only around 700.",
