  "input": "",
  "output": "Vaccinations have had a significant effect on life expectancy over the past century. Vaccines have greatly decreased the mortality and morbidity of many dangerous illnesses, including, but not limited to smallpox, polio, measles and whooping cough. With the development of vaccines, millions of Americans are now able to live longer, healthier lives and are protected from these life-threatening diseases. Vaccines help eliminate the spread of disease by building an immunity within those who receive them. They reduce the severity of a disease, the number of people who contract it and the number of deaths due to the disease. This has had a direct effect on the life expectancy of Americans and has helped to increase the overall life expectancy of all individuals.",
