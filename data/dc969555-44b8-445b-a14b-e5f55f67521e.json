  "input": "",
  "output": "Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the banking industry by providing a faster, more secure, and more efficient way of transferring funds. By using a distributed ledger, the blockchain eliminates the need for a centralized authority to process transactions, leading to improved transaction speed and reduced costs. Blockchain also reduces or eliminates the risk of fraud, by providing an immutable record of each transaction and guaranteeing that transactions are cryptographically secure. Blockchain also enables smarter contracts, allowing banks to write contracts that adhere to self-executing rules, creating an automated system for verifying and enforcing contracts.",
