  "input": "",
  "output": "Providing free healthcare has numerous economic benefits. It reduces the financial burden of healthcare on individuals, which in turn can increase their purchasing power and boost the economy. Free healthcare can also reduce health- and income-based inequality by providing access to healthcare services to those who might not otherwise be able to afford it. Furthermore, providing free healthcare can result in long-term cost savings due to improved health outcomes and decreased need for costly treatments or interventions. This in turn can lead to increased productivity and improved economic opportunities.",
