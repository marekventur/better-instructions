  "output": "Unstructured play is important for a child's development, as it helps them to develop their problem-solving and reasoning skills, encourages creativity and imagination, and helps them learn about their environment. It also helps children to develop their social and emotional skills, build self-confidence and resilience, and practice sharing and taking turns. Unstructured play also helps to build physical strength and coordination, as well as helping children become better communicators.",
