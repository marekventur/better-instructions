  "output": "The circulatory system is made up of three main parts: the heart, the blood vessels, and the blood. The heart is a muscular organ that is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. The blood vessels are the network of vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. These vessels include arteries, which carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, and veins, which carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. The blood is composed of cells that circulate in the vessels, transports oxygen and nutrients to the body's organs and tissues, and returns deoxygenated blood to the heart to be purified.",
