  "output": "To make a paper airplane, start by folding a piece of paper in half along its width. Unfold the paper and then make 2 folds along the length. Next, fold the top corners of the paper so that they meet in the center. Unfold the paper and fold the top corners in again. Fold the plane in half along its length and then make 2 more folds. Finally, fold down the wings and the paper plane is ready to fly.",
