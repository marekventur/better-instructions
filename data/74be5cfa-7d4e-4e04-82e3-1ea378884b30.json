  "input": "",
  "output": "The darkness was oppressive as I slowly crept forward with my flashlight, its beam only able to hint at the secrets that lurked in the shadows. My heart raced as I heard strange noises, each step I took creating a new reverberation throughout the abandoned house. Suddenly, the light illuminated what appeared to be a skeletal figure in the corner. With trembling hands, I shined the light to reveal a malicious grin on its decayed face. I backed away slowly and ran out of the house, never to return.",
