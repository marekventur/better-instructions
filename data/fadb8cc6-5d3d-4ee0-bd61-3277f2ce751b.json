  "output": "The hog-nosed skunk, also known as the stink badger, is native to the foothills and valleys of California\u2019s Sierra Nevada. It has a distinct zigzag stripe that runs down its back and a white-tipped tail. It has a pink nose, which gives rise to its name, and long claws for digging. Despite its small size, the hog-nosed skunk is well-equipped for defence, with its strong odour used to repel both predators and potential mates. It is mostly nocturnal, and feeds mainly on insects, small mammals and fruits.",
