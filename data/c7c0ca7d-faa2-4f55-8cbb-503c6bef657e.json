  "output": "Realists view international relations as being based on power and interests, whereas Idealists believe in the possibility of cooperative decision-making. Realists emphasize the self-interest of nations and the balance of power between them, whereas Idealists emphasize the idea of moral progress and international cooperation. Realists believe that states should pursue their own interests without reliance on international organizations, whereas Idealists believe that states should resolve conflicts in the international system through international organizations and multilateral agreements.",
