  "output": "The types of humor used in the movie \u201cMean Girls\u201d include physical comedy, sarcasm, and irony. Physical comedy, such as Tina Fey's character's physical reactions to bad news, is used to create lighthearted moments throughout the movie. Sarcasm, such as the character of Janis Ian's snarky, cutting remarks, is used to add an edge to the humor. Lastly, irony is often seen in the instances where the popular girls get justice for their wrongdoings, like when Regina George is hit by a bus.",
