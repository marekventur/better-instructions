  "instruction": "Describe a method for solving the following equation: 2x - y + 7 = 0",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One method for solving the equation is to first add 7 to both sides of the equation, so that y is isolated on the left-hand side. Then, divide both sides by 2, including the y-term, to cancel out the coefficient of 2. The resulting equation will have a single variable equal to the solution of the original equation.",
