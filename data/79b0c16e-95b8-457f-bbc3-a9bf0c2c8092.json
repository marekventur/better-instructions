I can\u2019t believe you have moved all the way across the world and are exploring a new place and culture. I know you\u2019re going to make amazing memories and I can\u2019t wait to hear all about it when you get back.\n\nI hope this letter finds you well in your new home and that you\u2019re feeling happy and fulfilled. I miss having you over for game nights and movie marathons, but I\u2019m sure all the new experiences you\u2019re having more than make up for it. If there\u2019s ever anything you need, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\n\nI love you, always.\nLots of love,\n[Your Name]",
