  "input": "",
  "output": "The most effective way to store a sparse matrix in Python is to use a data structure known as a \"linked list.\" This data structure relies on nodes with two fields: a value and a pointer. Each node contains the value of an element in the matrix, which is 0 if the element is empty, and a pointer to the next non-zero element. This makes it efficient to search for non-zero elements, as the linked list structure allows for quick look-ups.",
