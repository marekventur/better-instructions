  "input": "",
  "output": "People prefer laptops to desktops for a variety of reasons. First, laptops are much more portable than desktops, making them ideal for those who need to work or study from multiple locations. Second, laptops are typically much less expensive than desktops, allowing people to get the same capabilities for much less money. Finally, laptops typically have much shorter setup times, as all of their components are already installed and ready to use.",
