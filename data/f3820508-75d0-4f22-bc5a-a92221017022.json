  "input": "",
  "output": "The spooky old house stands alone in a dark and dismal forest, surrounded by a thick fog. It is full of creaky, ageless floors and walls that seem to stretch on forever. The windows are filled with cobwebs and broken glass, and there is a choking smell of must and rot in the air. Through the broken doorways, one can catch a glimpse of forgotten furniture and paintings, covered in dust. No light comes from within - the house seems to remain in a perpetual state of gloom, making it a perfect setting for a horror scene.",
