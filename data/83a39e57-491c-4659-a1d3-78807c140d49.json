  "input": "",
  "output": "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to find a set of parameters that minimizes a given cost function. It works by repeatedly taking small steps in the direction of the opposite of the cost function's gradient vector, leading the cost towards a global minimum. The magnitude of the steps taken is determined by the learning rate parameter, which can be tuned for optimal performance. Gradient descent is used in many machine learning algorithms and is one of the key techniques used in deep learning.",
