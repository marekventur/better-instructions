  "input": "",
  "output": "In order to keep our environment healthy, we need to reduce our consumption of natural resources and practice sustainable habits. We need to reduce our use of plastics, shop local, and invest in green energy sources. We also need to reduce our carbon footprint by carpooling, eating locally produced food, and growing our own food if possible. Finally, we must recognize our role in conserving and protecting the environment and be willing to take action in our own lives to do our part.",
