  "output": "A perfect day for me would start with a cup of coffee while watching the sunrise and listening to the morning birdsong. Then, I would go for a long walk in the woods and enjoy the fresh air and nature. There would be an afternoon picnic with friends to share stories and laughter. The evening would end with a sunset hike followed by a cozy dinner cooked with love.",
