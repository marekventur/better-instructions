  "input": "",
  "output": "The stock market is an exchange where investors can trade shares in publicly traded companies. These companies have their stocks listed on the exchange. When someone buys a share of stock, they become a part-owner of the company. When the value of the company rises, so too does the value of the stock, which increases the investor's wealth. Conversely, if the company's stock decreases in value, so too will the investor's wealth. Stock markets provide an opportunity to increase wealth and gain financial freedom.",
