  "output": "Physical Education (PE) in schools is of paramount importance. Schools that offer PE classes give students the opportunity to be active and stay fit, thus reducing the risk of long-term illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity. It is also a great way for students to learn about their own physical capabilities, develop confidence and gain team building skills. Furthermore, PE classes can be used to introduce students to different sports and activities that they may not have the opportunity to try otherwise. This can help teach skills such as problem solving and provide an avenue for students to pursue a lifelong interest in physical activities. Therefore, it is clear that offering PE classes in schools brings many benefits and should be encouraged.",
