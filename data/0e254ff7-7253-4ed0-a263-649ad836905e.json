  "output": "In 2071, the world was in chaos.  Global warming had taken its toll on the environment and huge tracts of land had drowned from rising sea levels.  The governments of the world had failed to stem the tide, instead squabbling amongst themselves and imposing tyrannical laws to keep their citizens in line.\n\nIn desperation, a group of scientists put forth a radical idea \u2013 to freeze the planet.  Using recently developed technology, they were able to manipulate the elements, turning the air and water around the planet into ice, throwing the world into a deep freeze. \n\nThe results were immediate and dramatic.  Sea levels dropped, the effects of climate change were reversed, and governments were quickly forced to abandon their old systems and come together to form a more unified, harmonious world.\n\nBut even as the people of the planet rejoiced, a dark undercurrent lurked beneath the surface.  Those same scientists had manipulated the ice to open up portals \u2013 to impossible, alternate dimensions \u2013 pulling alien life forms and powerful new technologies into our own. \n\nThe world would never be the same, and the story of the man who had the courage to accept this new reality and fight for a future he believed in had only just begun.",
