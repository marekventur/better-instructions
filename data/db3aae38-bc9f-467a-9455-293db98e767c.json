  "output": "\"Inversnaid\" by Gerard Manley Hopkins is a sonnet composed of three quatrains, centered each on the banks of Inversnaid, a lake in Scotland. The poem begins with a description of the lake and its solitude, turning towards a meditation on God's presence throughout history and creation. Hopkins uses personification of the river, as well as allusions to religion, to emphasize the divine power of the natural beauty of the lake. Through vivid imagery and allusions, Hopkins leads the reader to an understanding of the power of God's creation and providence.",
