  "output": "Waves are a fundamental part of physics, characterized by amplitude, frequency, and wavelength. They allow energy to be transferred from one place to another, and can be either periodic or aperiodic depending on the motion of the point on the wave. Periodic motion typically involves a point on a wave moving in circles or straight lines.",
