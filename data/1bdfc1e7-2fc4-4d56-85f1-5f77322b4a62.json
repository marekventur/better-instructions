  "output": "Improvement ideas for a movie review website:\n1. Make it easier to find reviews; add search filters that allow users to think of relevant reviews based on genre, rating, and year of release.\n2. Allow reviews to be personalized; this could include allowing users to mark the reviews they liked and dislike, and then personalizing the reviews they see based on those interests.\n3. Make it easier to write reviews; create a template that prompts users to answer key questions and rate their experience with the movie.\n4. Allow users to interact with reviews; add an interactive feature that allows users to comment on reviews and give their perspective.\n5. Add an aggregate rating system; incorporate an overall user rating system to give users a sense of the general opinion of the movie.\n6. Add additional content; add photos, audios, and videos from the movie and related material to give users a more in-depth experience.",
