  "output": "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that involves grouping data into clusters based on similarity. A cluster is a group of data points that have similar characteristics, features and attributes. The clustering process involves using algorithms to find the best possible grouping of the data. These algorithms calculate the distances between the data points and create the clusters. The resulting clusters can have various shapes and sizes and can assist in understanding the data better. Clustering is used in a variety of fields such as pattern recognition, data mining, market research and customer segmentation.",
