  "instruction": "Explain the phenomenon of colors in the aurora",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The colors of the aurora are caused by collisions between electrically charged particles released from the sun and gases in Earth's atmosphere. These particles enter the atmosphere and collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms at different altitudes. These collisions lead to the release of photons, which are particles of light, which give off the colors red, green and blue seen in the aurora. The colors depend on the type of gas that is being struck and its altitude.",
