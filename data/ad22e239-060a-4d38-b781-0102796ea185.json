  "output": "If AI becomes more advanced and prevalent, it could revolutionize our lives by enabling us to automate mundane and hazardous tasks. AI will also lead to the development of smarter robots and machines that could assist us in everyday life. AI can also help develop innovative solutions to pressing global issues such as climate change, pandemics, and even aging. In the future, AI could become so powerful that artificial agents may become the primary decision-makers in organizations, governments, and societies in general. This could lead to an era in which humans are liberated from manual labour, allowing us to pursue more meaningful activities and freeing us up to explore our creativity.",
