  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Volunteering allows individuals to build experience and learn new skills. By accepting volunteer roles, people can learn more about the nonprofit sector, pick up qualifications, or use volunteer roles as stepping stones to new career opportunities. \n2. Volunteering helps to reduce social isolation and improve a sense of belonging. People who volunteer often report feelings of satisfaction and accomplishment, as well as improved social well-being and purpose in life. \n3. Volunteering provides much-needed support to charities and organizations that work to meet the needs of their communities. Volunteering offers organizations the chance to build relationships with potential donors, and also helps to ensure that limited resources are stretched further.",
