  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between static and dynamic memory management is that static memory allocation is done before a program is run, whereas dynamic memory allocation is done during the program's execution. Static memoryallocates and deallocates memory based on the program\u2019s size, whereas dynamic memory allocates and deallocates memory based on the program\u2019s usage.",
