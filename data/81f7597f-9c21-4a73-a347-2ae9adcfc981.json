  "output": "My house is a cozy two-story home nestled in a quiet suburban neighborhood. The exterior of the house is painted a soft light blue and it is surrounded by a lawn with lush greenery. The living room and kitchen have an open layout, so the entire family can spend time together in one large space. Upstairs are the bedrooms, each with its own unique and comfortable d\u00e9cor. My house is small but warm, and it always brings a smile to my face.",
