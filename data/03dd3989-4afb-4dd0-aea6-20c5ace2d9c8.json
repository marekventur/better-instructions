  "output": "Humans interact with the internet of things (IoT) through the use of devices and applications designed to improve their lives. Through sensors and software, these devices and applications can collect data and help automate mundane tasks, such as turning lights on or off when you enter a room. Through voice recognition and artificial intelligence, we are able to use natural language to give commands to our devices that allow us to access data, information or services. We can also use our devices to interact with other IoT-enabled devices, such as smart home appliances, and allow them to share information. These interactions between humans and the IoT are allowing us to make life easier and more connected than ever before.",
