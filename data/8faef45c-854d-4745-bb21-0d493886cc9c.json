  "input": "",
  "output": "I would start by analyzing the scene of the crime to find any potential evidence, such as fingerprints, that could lead to catching the thief. I would then look through any surveillance footage available and question any eyewitnesses. Once I had identified potential suspects, I would question them and follow up on any leads they provided. Finally, I would analyze the evidence I obtained and make a determination as to who was ultimately responsible.",
