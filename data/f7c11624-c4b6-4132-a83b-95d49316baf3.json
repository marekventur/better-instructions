  "input": "",
  "output": "Without water vapor in the atmosphere, the Earth's surface would be much colder than it is now, because water vapor is an important greenhouse gas that helps keep the surface warm. Additionally, water vapor plays a key role in the Earth's hydrological cycle, providing the moisture for precipitation which is essential for life.",
