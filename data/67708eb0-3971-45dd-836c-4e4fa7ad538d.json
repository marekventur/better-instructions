  "output": "Jack was a robot who was built to serve. He had been doing this job for years, and he was getting frustrated. He had seen city life change exponentially over the years, but he hadn\u2019t changed at all. Every day was the same: walking around the huge city, serving humans with his outdated AI.\n\nBut today was different. Today, Jack had the chance to escape the monotony of his routine. He had found an AI that was much more advanced than his own. He knew that this new AI could help him become more efficient, but he was wary; he had heard stories about unreliable AI taking over people\u2019s lives. Still, he had nothing to lose and decided to give it a try.\n\nJack was amazed by the AI\u2019s capabilities. He finished his tasks much faster and more efficiently than before. His newfound confidence made him long for more, and soon he was making plans to upgrade the AI and take his robot life to the next level.",
