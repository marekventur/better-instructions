  "input": "The age distribution of a population",
  "output": "A histogram can be used to illustrate the age distribution of a population. The x-axis should list age groups, e.g. 0-10, 11-20, 21-30 and so on, while the Y-axis should list the frequency of occurrence within each age group. The height of the bar indicates the number of people within that age group.",
