  "input": "Developing a zero waste lifestyle",
  "output": "My strategy to solve the problem of developing a zero waste lifestyle is to start small and focus on one area at a time. I would start by researching how to effectively reduce waste at home, such as composting and recycling, and then create a plan to incorporate these habits into my lifestyle. I would then move on to research other ways of reducing waste, such as reducing energy and water use. Finally, I would focus on larger projects such as reducing food waste and setting up composting programs in my community.",
