  "input": "",
  "output": "I experienced racial injustice when I moved to a neighborhood that seemed very welcoming at first. However, when I went to rent an apartment, I was told the units I had inquired about were no longer available. I soon discovered that these units were still available to people who were not of the same racial background as me. This experience opened my eyes to the fact that discriminatory practices are still very prevalent.",
