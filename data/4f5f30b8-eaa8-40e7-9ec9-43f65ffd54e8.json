Create an online platform that provides practical information and resources on health and social care to seniors, along with virtual support groups for sharing experiences, giving advice, and offering encouragement. \n4. Develop an application for making grocery lists, organizing and tracking medications and doctor appointments. \n5. Develop a mobile app to connect younger generations with the older generations in the form of a virtual-mentoring program that provides guidance, advice and support. Additionally, this app could also provide games, activities, and conversation topics to help bridge the gap between generations.",
