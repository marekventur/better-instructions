  "input": "Shortage of water in rural areas",
  "output": "A creative solution to the shortage of water in rural areas could be to implement water catchment systems that collect and store rainwater, incentivize drip irrigation and other water conservation practices, and deploy water-efficient appliances and fixtures. Additionally, increasing awareness regarding the importance of water conservation could be helpful. Another potential solution might be to create water-sharing initiatives between different villages that could pool resources to manage their water supply.",
