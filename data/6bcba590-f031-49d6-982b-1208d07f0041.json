  "input": "",
  "output": "Civil rights in the United States have evolved over time, from the fight for basic freedoms from oppressive government to the quest for full equality and inclusion. In the years since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, there have been significant advances in civil rights, resulting in the desegregation of public schools, the abolition of Jim Crow laws, the expansion of voting rights, and the passage of legislation prohibiting discrimination based on gender, race, and other characteristics. Today, America is still working to achieve full civil rights, as evidenced by the Black Lives Matter Movement and the fight for LGBTQ+ rights.",
