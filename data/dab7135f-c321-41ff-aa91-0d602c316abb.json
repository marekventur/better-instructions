  "output": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that involves computers analyzing large amounts of data to recognize patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. By using algorithms to make data-driven decisions, machines can be trained to act and make decisions without relying on explicit instructions. For example, a machine can be trained to recognize different features in images or learn to respond to different types of input.",
