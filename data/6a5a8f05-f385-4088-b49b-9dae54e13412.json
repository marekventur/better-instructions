  "output": "I'm standing in a forest filled with tall trees and lush, green foliage. The air is thick with the scent of pine and woodsmoke. Everywhere I look I see shades of brown and green, contrasted with bursts of color from wildflowers. The sun breaks through the tree canopy above, illuminating the ground in dappled patches of light and shadow. A light breeze rustles the trees, making a soothing sound that calms my mind.",
