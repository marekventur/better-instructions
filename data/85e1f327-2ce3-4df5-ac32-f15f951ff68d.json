  "output": "The sun filtering through the trees\nThe birds singing sweet melodies\nOn a bench, you stopped to rest\nAnd dream of a life that's blessed\n\nLife seeming so mundane and slow\nYou wished that doors to depths would show\nIn realms unknown, with no limits, soar\nAbove the clouds, you could explore\n\nYou still remember that bright spring day\nWhen adventurers in your heart once played\nToday, your fears are no more alive\nTowards the sky, your hopes revive\n\nYou know a journey is the only way\nTo break the chains, no longer sway\nYour heart is open, ready for flight\nToday's the day, a new world in sight.",
