  "input": "",
  "output": "This phrase is a reminder that money should be used wisely as it is a powerful tool. Money can be a good servant in that it can be used to help other people, save for the future, and make investments and wise choices. But money can also be a bad master if it is used to take advantage of others, lived beyond our means, or abused. Money should be respected and used judiciously.",
