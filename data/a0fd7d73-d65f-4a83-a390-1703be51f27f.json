  "instruction": "Describe a smart contract.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A smart contract is a self-executing contract that facilitates, verifies, and enforces the terms of an agreement, without the need for a third-party intermediary. Unlike traditional contracts, smart contracts are stored and executed on distributed ledger technology such as blockchain and are typically programmed in a high-level language like Solidity. Smart contracts can be used for a variety of applications, such as automating payments, exchanging assets, building trust and reputation systems, executing legal processes, and more.",
