  "output": "A river of light cascades down \nIlluminating the night's frown \nTouching the stars with its gleam \nRadiating through the moon's beam \n\nPeaceful and calming it flows \nTwisting and turning wherever it goes \nReflecting stars in its wake \nGently filtering through the lake \n\nThe river of light has its own song \nFilling the night with its sweet throng \nLingering long after it passes by \nIt fills the heart with joy and light on high.",
