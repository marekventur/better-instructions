  "output": "The theory of relativity is founded on two basic principles. The first is the principle of relativity, which states that the outcome of any experiment is the same no matter what the observer's frame of reference. The second is the principle of invariance, which states that the laws of physics remain the same no matter where or how fast the observer is moving. These principles form the basis of special relativity, which deals with the effects of motion on time, space, and the laws of physics at a speed close to the speed of light. This theory is underpinned by Einstein's famous equation: E = mc2, which relates energy and mass. General relativity is an extension of special relativity and explains gravity in terms of the curvature of spacetime. Einstein's famous equation for general relativity is G = 8\u03c0T, which relates the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy.",
