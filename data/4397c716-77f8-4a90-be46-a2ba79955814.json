  "input": "",
  "output": "Chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells and some other photosynthetic organisms like algae. They are the site of photosynthesis which is a process by which plants capture energy from sunlight and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars which the plant cells can use for energy. Animal cells do not contain chloroplasts as they do not need to photosynthesize in order to make food.",
