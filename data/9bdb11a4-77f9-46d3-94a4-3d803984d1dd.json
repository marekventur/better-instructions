  "output": "My opinion is that technology can be a great tool in the classroom if used correctly. It can enable teachers to better engage with students and enable them to more easily access learning materials. Technology can also facilitate collaborative learning, enabling students to learn from each other. However, it is important to ensure that technology does not become a distraction and that students are not spending too much time online in class.",
