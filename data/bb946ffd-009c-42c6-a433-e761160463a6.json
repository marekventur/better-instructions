  "output": "Once upon a time there were two rivals, both determined to be the best in their field. They had been pitted against each other since the beginning, and neither could ever quite gain the upperhand. Their rivalry became infamous and it seemed that no matter what each of them did, the other would come out on top. \n\nOne day, the two rivals met in person and instead of arguing, they began to talk. Their fierce competitiveness gradually softened, and eventually the two of them began to understand each other. As their understanding and friendship grew, the rivalry began to fade away.\n\nSoon, the two of them realized that their friendship was much more valuable than their rivalry. Together, they worked more efficiently and productively, supporting and inspiring each other to do their best. They shared their knowledge and skills and soon, they were a formidable team. \n\nThe two former rivals were now the best of friends, and they worked together to achieve greater and greater goals. Their friendship was so strong that it inspired those around them, and they were able to achieve things they never dreamed possible.",
