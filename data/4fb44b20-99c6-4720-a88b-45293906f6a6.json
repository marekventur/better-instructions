  "input": "",
  "output": "Genetic engineering is a technology used to alter the genetic makeup of plants and animals to create organisms with desired traits. In the case of crop yields, genetic engineering can be used to develop plants with increased resistance to pests, improved drought tolerance, and enhanced nutrient efficiency. It can also be used to modify the size and shape of the crop for better harvesting. Additionally, genetic engineering can be used to modify the biology of a plant so that it can better grow in challenging environments.",
