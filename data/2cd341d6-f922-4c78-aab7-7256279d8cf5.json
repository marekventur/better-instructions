  "input": "",
  "output": "A friend cheating on a test is an ethical dilemma that can be difficult to navigate. On one hand, it may be beneficial for the friend to \"get away with it\" in the short-term. On the other hand, it is not fair to their peers who are working hard and staying honest. In addition, condoning cheating sets a problematic precedent and encourages similar behavior in the future. In this situation, one should confront their friend and explain why cheating is wrong, and suggest exploring alternative strategies before engaging in unethical behavior.",
