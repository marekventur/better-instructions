  "input": "",
  "output": "Fossils form when the remains of dead organisms are buried in sediment and are then subjected to intense heat and pressure over millions of years. As this happens, the sediments and minerals surrounding the remains become a mineral cast of the original organism. Over time, this cast is hardened into a rock, preserving the shape of the organism and thus creating a fossil.",
