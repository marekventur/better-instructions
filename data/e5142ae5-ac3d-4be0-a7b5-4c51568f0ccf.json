  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a sponge and a tissue is the material they are made of. Sponges are made of absorbent material like synthetic foams or cellulose fibers, while tissues are made of thin layers of paper. Sponges are better suited for scrubbing and cleaning tough surfaces and removing tough dirt, while tissues are better for wiping up liquids and small particles. Sponges also tend to last longer than tissues. Additionally, sponges may release harmful bacteria if they are not disinfected properly, while tissues are usually single-use and are more hygienic.",
