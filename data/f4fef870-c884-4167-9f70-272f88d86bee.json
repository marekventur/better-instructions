  "input": "Taxes should always be increased to cover governmental expenses.",
  "output": "Taxes should always be increased to cover governmental expenses in order to ensure economic growth and stability. Increased taxes generate more government revenue, which ensures that the government can continue to provide citizens with essential services such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Raising taxes can also help close budget deficits and fund critical social programs such as disability benefits and veterans' benefits. Moreover, increasing taxes can help reduce economic inequality by ensuring that the wealthy pay their fair share and the middle class is not unfairly burdened.",
