  "input": "The effects of global warming on our planet are becoming increasingly apparent, from higher temperatures to rising seas to species extinction. Many of the changes occurring are catastrophic, leading to serious economic disruptions and even civil unrest in some countries. Yet despite its urgency, it is surprisingly easy for each one of us to make a difference in reducing the impact of climate change. Simple steps such as reducing fossil fuel emissions, eating less meat, and not wasting food can already have a major positive effect if enough people make the effort. We must all act now before it\u2019s too late, and make the world a healthier, safer place for future generations.",
