  "input": "",
  "output": "The area of the triangle is 25 square units. The formula used to find the area of a triangle is A = (1/2) * b * h, where b is the base length and h is the height of the triangle. In this case, the base length is 10 and the height is 5, so the area is (1/2) * 10 * 5 = 25.",
