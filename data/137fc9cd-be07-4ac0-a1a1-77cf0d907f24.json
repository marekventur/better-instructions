  "input": "",
  "output": "Buddhism and Hinduism are two distinguishably different religious beliefs. Buddhism is an atheist religion, believing in no God or gods. It encourages followers to lead ethical lives and become liberated through their own efforts. Hinduism is a polytheistic religion, believing in a Supreme God as well as many gods and goddesses. It focuses on Dharma, the moral code of conduct, and adherents to Hinduism carry out certain rituals and practices for spiritual growth and development. \nAnother contrast between the two religions is their view on life after death. Buddhism does not believe in an afterlife, and instead emphasizes living life in the present moment and avoiding attachment to material possessions. In contrast, Hinduism believes in rebirth, and people who live an ethical and moral life will enjoy a pleasant afterlife in Svarga.",
