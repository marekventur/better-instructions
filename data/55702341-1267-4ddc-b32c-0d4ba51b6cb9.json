  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to resolve an argument between two people is to approach it in a calm, respectful manner. Each person should take turns to fully express their feelings, thoughts and opinions, without interruption or blame. It\u2019s important to understand each other\u2019s perspectives and acknowledge each other\u2019s feelings. Once both sides have discussed the issue, it\u2019s time to find a compromise that both can agree on. If necessary, this can involve an outside mediator to help them come to a mutually beneficial resolution.",
