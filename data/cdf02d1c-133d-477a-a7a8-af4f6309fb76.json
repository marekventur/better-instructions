  "output": "Over the past 20 years, global climate change has had a devastating impact on the environment. Rising global temperatures have led to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, resulting in rising sea levels. Extreme weather patterns, such as extreme heat events, flooding, and drought, have become more frequent and intense. Changes in the climate can lead to habitat loss and species extinction, disrupt food webs and nutrient cycles, and reduce the availability of clean water.",
