  "input": "",
  "output": "Basketball was invented in 1891 by a physical education teacher named James Naismith. He created the game as a way to keep his students active during the winter months. Initially, the goal was just to throw a ball into a peach basket, and it wasn't until 1906 that the sport became known as basketball. The sport gained popularity throughout the United States and Canada, leading to the creation of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1949. In the 1950s and 1960s, basketball emerged as one of the most popular sports in the world, and continues to grow in popularity today.",
