  "input": "",
  "output": "Microevolution refers to small-scale changes in the genetic makeup of a species over time. This type of evolution can be observed and happens over a relatively short period of time. Macroevolution, on the other hand, refers to large-scale changes in the genetic makeup of a species over time. This type of evolution generally happens over a much longer time-span and is primarily observed through fossil records. The main difference between the two is the amount of genetic change that takes place and the time frame in which it occurs.",
