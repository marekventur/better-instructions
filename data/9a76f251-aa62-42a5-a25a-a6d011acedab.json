  "input": "",
  "output": "Pros: \n1. Building equity - Over time, the value of your house is likely to go up, allowing you to make money off your investment. \n2. Lower transport costs - It is often cheaper in the long run to own a house than to rent and live in the same area. \n\nCons:\n1. Maintenance costs - Homeowners are responsible for any repairs or maintenance costs that come up, which can be costly. \n2. Difficulty relocation - selling a house can be difficult if you have to move, especially if there is a down market.",
