  "input": "",
  "output": "The main cause of global warming is increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily due to burning fossil fuels and other human activities. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide trap heat in our atmosphere and cause the planet to warm. Other factors, such as deforestation and unsustainable land use, also contribute to global warming by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide that is naturally being removed from the atmosphere.",
