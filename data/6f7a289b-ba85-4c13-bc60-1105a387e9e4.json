  "output": "Tomatoes and watermelons are both fruits, but have distinct differences. Tomatoes have a red, juicy flesh and are known for being a savory fruit, while watermelons have a sweet, juicy flesh and are often thought of as a dessert food. Tomatoes have a hollow center, while watermelons are full of seeds. Tomatoes also have a thicker skin, whereas watermelons have a thin, green rind. The texture of the two fruits is quite different, with tomatoes having a soft, pulpy texture and watermelons having a crisp texture. Additionally, tomatoes are usually served cooked, while watermelons are usually eaten raw.",
