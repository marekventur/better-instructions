  "input": "",
  "output": "The purpose of hyperparameter optimization is to find the best set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. Hyperparameters are settings that affect the behavior of a machine learning model, and optimization seeks to determine the best combination of values for these hyperparameters. This can improve the performance of the model, allowing it to achieve better accuracy on unseen data.",
