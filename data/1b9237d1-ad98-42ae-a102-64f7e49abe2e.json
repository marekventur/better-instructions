  "output": "The United States government pursues a mixed economic policy, combining elements of both free market capitalism and regulated government intervention. In general, the government provides structure and support to the economy by providing public resources, regulating industries, laws and regulations, welfare programs, and enforcing trade agreements. The overall goal is to ensure economic growth while protecting the interests of consumers, workers, and businesses.
