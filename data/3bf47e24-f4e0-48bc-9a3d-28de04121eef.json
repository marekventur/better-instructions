  "input": "",
  "output": "If I had to make a presentation but were not prepared, I would take a deep breath and try to remain calm. I would ask for permission to take some time to prepare, or try to buy some time by asking for questions from the audience or other presenters. After that, I would gather as much material as possible, review it quickly, and create an outline of my ideas. During the presentation, I would try to remain relaxed and be interactive. I would use visual aids to help explain my points and engage the audience, and I would encourage feedback and questions. Finally, I would thank them for their time and apologize if I couldn't answer all the questions I had.",
