  "input": "A study on the primary causes of obesity among children ages 6-18 living in the United States.",
  "output": "The data analysis techniques that could be used to analyze this data includes descriptive analysis to examine the trends in obesity among children; regression analysis to investigate how various factors contribute to the obesity rates among children; correlation analysis to determine the relationship between factors; and clustering analysis to identify different segments based on the factors related to obesity.  Additionally, predictive modeling could be used to predict the probability of a child becoming obese or staying obese.  Other data analysis techniques such as multiple regression, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling could be used to gain further understanding of the causes of obesity among children.",
