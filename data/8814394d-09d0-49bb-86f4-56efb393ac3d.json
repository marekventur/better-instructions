  "input": "",
  "output": "The converse of the statement \"I will pass the test\" is \"If I pass the test\". This is because the converse of a sentence is formed by switching the positions of the subject and the predicate. In this case, the subject is \"I\" and the predicate is \"will pass the test\", so if the converse is written, the positions of the subject and the predicate are switched to \"If I pass the test\".",
