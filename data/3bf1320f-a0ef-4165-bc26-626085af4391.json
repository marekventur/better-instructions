  "output": "I would love to live in a house that was nestled away in a quiet corner of the world. It would be surrounded by nature and have lots of trees, flowers, and wildlife. Inside the house, I would love to have lots of large windows that let in lots of natural light and provide views of the beautiful scenery outside. My perfect house would be full of cozy furniture and decorations, and it would have enough space to host occasional gatherings with family and friends.",
