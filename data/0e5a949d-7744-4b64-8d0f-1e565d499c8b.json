  "output": "Public speaking is a valuable skill that can help people share their ideas, stories, and experiences. There are a few key points to keep in mind to deliver a great speech. \n\nFirst, it is important to practice beforehand. Practice is essential to ensure that one's message is clear and engaging. After preparation and practice, a speaker should open their speech with an attention-grabbing statement. Next, they should tell their audience the purpose of their speech, tell a few stories and provide evidence to back up their points. They should also use affective words to create an emotional connection, and use \u2018transitions\u2019 to tie ideas together. Lastly, the speaker should leave a lasting impression by concluding with a memorable story or quote. \n\nOverall, the key to a successful speech is preparation and practice. Creating an engaging and memorable speech requires a speaker to have the right tools, like effective stories and evidence. These can help a speaker communicate effectively with their audience.",
