  "input": "Product: Apples",
  "output": "Here are three creative ways to use apples:\n\n1. Make an apple crisp. Start by cutting apples into thin slices and placing them into a dish. Spread a mixture of dry oats, melted butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon over the apples and bake until crispy and golden.\n\n2. Make an apple pie. Start by combining diced apples, cinnamon, and sugar into a filling. Roll out two rounds of pastry dough and place it in a pie dish. Pour the filling onto the dough and top with a second round of pastry. Bake until golden.\n\n3. Make homemade applesauce. Start by peeling and coring the apples and cutting into slices. Place the apples in a pot with a small amount of water and cook until the apples are soft. Mash the apples with a spoon or potato masher and serve. Add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a tablespoon of honey if desired.",
