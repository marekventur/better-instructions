  "output": "Data collection can be divided into three main categories: quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. Quantitative data is often numerical in nature and collected through surveys, experiments or observations. Qualitative data is usually descriptive or narrative in form, such as interviews or participant observation. Mixed methods are a combination of both qualitative and quantitative data, allowing for patterns to be observed that may be missed by either of the other two methods. Quantitative data can provide empirical evidence to back up qualitative observations and vice versa.",
