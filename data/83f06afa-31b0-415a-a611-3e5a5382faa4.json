  "output": "An appropriate data structure to store information about a student's performance would be a hash map. Using a hash map, key-value pairs can be stored that represent different pieces of information about the student's performance. For example, the key could be the grade level and the value could be the student's score on a test. This makes it easy to quickly look up an individual student's performance data by searching for their grade level.",
