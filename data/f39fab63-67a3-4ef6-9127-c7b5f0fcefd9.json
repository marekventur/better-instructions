  "output": "An apple is generally round and small, with a crunchy and sweet flesh, whereas an orange is typically oval-shaped and larger, with a juicy and tart flavor. Both fruits contain citric acid and vitamin C, though apples also contain fiber and oranges contain fiber and more Vitamin C. Apples are usually eaten fresh and are associated with health benefits such as improved digestion and a lower risk of stroke, while oranges can be eaten fresh or juiced and are linked to lowered cholesterol levels.",
