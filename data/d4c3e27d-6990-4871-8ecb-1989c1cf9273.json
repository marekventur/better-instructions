  "output": "A shimmer of snow in the night,\nRadiates with such pure light.\nIlluminates like a star,\nBringing warmth near and far.\n\nA blanket of snow so grand,\nLike a brilliant wave on land.\nSmoothness so gentle to touch,\nMaking the winter so much more special, so much.\n\nSnowflakes drift down like a lullaby,\nDancing with the wind so elegantly in the sky.\nMelting snowflakes like teardrops from the heavens,\nCreating a river of peace and serenity.",
