  "input": "",
  "output": "The economic rebound post COVID-19 is beneficial because it represents a return to normalcy for many businesses that are at risk of collapse due to the pandemic. The rebound provides hope and security for those affected by job loss and decreased wages as businesses and industries slowly begin to recover. It can potentially create new jobs and opportunities, as well as bolster existing businesses. A strong economy also encourages investment, promoting economic growth and stability.",
