  "input": "",
  "output": "Pascal's Triangle and Fibonacci sequence are both mathematical concepts with similar shapes. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers which is created by adding the two numbers above it. The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. While both constructions have the same general shape, Pascal's Triangle is focused on the sum of the above numbers, while Fibonacci Sequence deals with the sum of the two preceding numbers instead.",
