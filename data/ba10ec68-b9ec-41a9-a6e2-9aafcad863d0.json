  "output": "The former owner of the car was sprinting at a sharp pace and ran into a delicious smelling restaurant. Inside, guests were writing with an ink pen and laughing. He was so entranced with the atmosphere that he completely forgot why he had come. \n \nSuddenly, he remembered why he was there and frantically started looking for his car keys. He looked high and low all around until he stumbled upon them near the inkpot. With his car keys in hand, he walked out of the restaurant and smiled to himself. He was glad to have found his keys and been able to enjoy the unique atmosphere of the restaurant as well.",
