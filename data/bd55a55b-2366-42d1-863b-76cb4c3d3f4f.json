  "input": "",
  "output": "I would invent a form of wooden brick housing. This type of housing would be constructed from wooden bricks that are designed to be weather-resistant, fireproof, and easy to assemble. The wood bricks would be made from sustainably-sourced wood and would be fireproofed using special eco-friendly, fire retardant materials. The wood could be reused at the end of the product's lifespan, making this type of housing highly eco-friendly. The bricks could be kept together using special adhesives that are also friendly to the environment.",
