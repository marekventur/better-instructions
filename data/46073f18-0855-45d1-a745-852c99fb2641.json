  "input": "",
  "output": "The four major components of the water cycle are evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. Evaporation is the process by which liquid water is transformed into water vapor. Condensation is the process by which water vapor is transformed into tiny droplets and clouds. Precipitation is when the tiny droplets and clouds become rain, snow, or other forms of precipitation. Collection is when precipitation falls back to the Earth and is stored in the oceans, lakes, and other bodies of water.",
