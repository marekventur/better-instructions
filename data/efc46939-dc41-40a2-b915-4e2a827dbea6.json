Set up specific times for work, breaks, and leisure activities, and set goals and tasks for each day. It's also important to create a space that is comfortable and conducive to productivity, while avoiding distractions such as television and social media. Additionally, staying connected with coworkers can boost morale and productivity, so communicating with them regularly is important.
