  "input": "",
  "output": "The current voting methods in the United States are highly effective in terms of voter participation. Voter registration is accessible to most citizens, and the exercise of the right to vote is mostly secure. However, there has been a rise in voting restriction laws in some states in the past decade, which contain provisions that prevent some people from registration and voting, creating an unequal environment for some voters. Additionally, the electoral system of the United States does not always accurately reflect the popular vote, and the process of gerrymandering has been increasingly used to manipulate the outcomes of elections.",
