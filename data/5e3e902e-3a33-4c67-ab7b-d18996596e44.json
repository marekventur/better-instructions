  "output": "Two ways companies can manage their online reputation are by actively monitoring their online presence and engaging with customers. Companies should be aware of how they are being talked about online, and they should actively monitor any reviews and social media posts that pertain to their company. Additionally, companies should engage with customers and latest updates on their websites and social media accounts.
