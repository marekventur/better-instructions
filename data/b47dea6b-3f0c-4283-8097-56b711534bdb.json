  "output": "The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change form. This means that the total amount of energy in a system remains constant, even if it is converted from one form to another. This law applies to all forms of energy, including heat, light, electrical, chemical, and mechanical energy.",
