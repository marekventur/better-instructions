  "input": "A deserted castle in the middle of a dark forest",
  "output": "A deserted castle stands at the centre of a thick and dark forest. The castle walls are weathered and overgrown with ivy, and the iron gates are rusted and corroded with age. The castle is almost entirely engulfed by the darkness of the surrounding woods, the only light coming from a few stars peeking through the branches of the trees. The castle is silent and still, an otherworldly place of forgotten memories and ancient secrets.",
