  "instruction": "Create a program that can detect potential fraudulent activity.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The program should be able to detect potential fraudulent activity by monitoring activity such as large, sudden payments or non-recurring payments from unknown or suspicious sources. The program should also be capable of flagging multiple payments from a single source, as well as multiple payments made on a single day. Additionally, the program should detect payments that contain keywords associated with fraud or suspicious activity, as well as activity from high-risk countries.",
