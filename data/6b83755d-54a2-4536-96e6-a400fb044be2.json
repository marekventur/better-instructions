  "output": "The primary data structure used in machine learning algorithms is often an array or matrix. Arrays and matrices are used to store data such as feature vectors, labels, and other information used during training and inference. Arrays are typically used when there is a single data type or multiple related data types, while matrices are used when the data can be decomposed into rows and columns.",
