  "output": "A hard disk is a type of storage device where data is stored on a rotating disk. It is composed of multiple platters that spin at very high speeds, creating a magnetic field. A Solid State Drive (SSD) is a type of storage device that uses electronic memory to store data. It does not have any movable parts, making it faster and more reliable than a hard disk.",
