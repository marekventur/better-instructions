  "input": "Social media can be dangerous. It can cause younger people to become depressed, anxious, and insecure.",
  "output": "Research shows that social media can be highly detrimental to young people, particularly those who are still developing emotionally and mentally. Numerous studies have linked the excessive usage of social media to the increasing likelihood of depression, anxiety, and insecurity in teens and even pre-teens. Anomalous behaviour online can be damaging for a number of reasons. It can lead to serious issues with self-esteem and self-worth, as users may be presented with a highly distorted picture of society, where everybody else appears to have a perfect life. Furthermore, it can also increase the risk of cyberbullying.",
