  "input": "",
  "output": "Immanuel Kant believed that morality is based on a universal set of maxims derived from the principles of reason, while Friedrich Nietzsche rejected the notion of objective knowledge and argued instead for the pursuit of individual self-interest, or the \u201cwill to power\u201d. Furthermore, Kant argued that morality is universal and binding, while Nietzsche argued that it is not necessarily so. Kant also believed in free will, while Nietzsche promoted amor fati or complete acceptance of fate. Kant and Nietzsche have distinctly different philosophies in regards to morality and free will.",
