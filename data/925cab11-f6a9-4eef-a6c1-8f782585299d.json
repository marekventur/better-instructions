  "input": "",
  "output": "The Enlightenment and Romanticism are two distinct movements that occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries respectively. The Enlightenment stressed reason and rational thinking, while Romanticism was more concerned with emotion, nature and the individual experience. Enlightenment thinkers believed in progress and the attainment of knowledge, while Romantics valorized imagination and creativity. The former was focused on the people, whereas the latter focused on the individual. Finally, the Enlightenment advocated for a higher moral standard and humanism, while the Romantic movement yearned for a return to simpler times and appreciated the joys of nature.",
