  "instruction": "Analyze two websites for accessibility and make recommended improvements.",
  "input": "Website 1: www.example.com \nWebsite 2: www.example2.com",
  "output": "Website 1:\nThe color contrast does not meet standard accessibility requirements. Font size is too small for readability. Alt-text is lacking from many images which compromises accessibility. \n\nSuggested improvements: Increase the font size, add contrast to the background, add descriptive alt-text to the images. \n\nWebsite 2: \nLayout is too cramped and difficult to navigate. Navigation tab is placed at bottom of page which is not very prominent or accessible.\n\nSuggested improvements: Make elements more spaced out, reorganize the navigation so that it is placed at the top or side of the page.",
