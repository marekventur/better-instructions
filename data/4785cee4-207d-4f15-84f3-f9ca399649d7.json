  "input": "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning",
  "output": "1. Artificial Intelligence is the science of making computers and machines smart, while Machine Learning is the process of making machines learn to do certain tasks autonomously.\n2. Artificial Intelligence involves the ability of machines to reason, solve problems, think and understand meaning, while Machine Learning is based on algorithms and statistical models that allow machines to recognize patterns from large datasets and to make predictions.\n3. Artificial Intelligence is the broad concept while Machine Learning is a subfield of AI.\n4. Artificial Intelligence systems are designed to mimic human-like behavior, while Machine Learning systems absorb data and identify trends in it through algorithms.",
