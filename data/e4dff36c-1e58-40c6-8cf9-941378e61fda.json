  "instruction": "Explain why fossil fuels are non-renewable resources.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas are non-renewable resources due to the fact that they are finite and cannot be replaced once they are used. Fossil fuels are created over millions of years from decaying organisms, and the rate at which they are created is much slower than the rate at which they are being consumed. Fossil fuels are valuable sources of energy, but they are not renewable and therefore cannot be replaced once used. Additionally, the use of fossil fuels releases harmful pollutants into the atmosphere, further exacerbating the negative environmental impact.",
