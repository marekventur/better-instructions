  "instruction": "Describe how a cloud forms.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A cloud is formed when warm air rises, cools, and reaches its dew point, at which point it releases moisture in the form of tiny water droplets or ice crystals. These droplets or crystals form the visible shapes of clouds that are seen in the sky. As the air continues to rise, the droplets or crystals continue to grow in size, until eventually they become too heavy and fall back toward the Earth as precipitation.",
