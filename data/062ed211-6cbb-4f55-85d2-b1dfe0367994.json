  "instruction": "Sources predict that the stock price for Company A will either stay the same or go up for the next 10 trading days. Pick a strategy for if the price will go up or stay the same.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "If the sources are correct and the stock price is predicted to either stay the same or go up, then a good strategy would be to buy the stock if the price is low, and then wait until it either goes up or stays the same. This is because the sources have already suggested that the price will not go down, so there is minimal risk. If the stock does go up, then the investor stands to make a profit. If the stock stays the same, the investor will at least not experience any loss.",
