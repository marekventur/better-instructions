  "input": "",
  "output": "When a basketball is bouncing, the arc of its trajectory creates a mesmerizing effect. Its circular motion draws the eye and its hypnotic movement draws the viewer in. As the ball encounters resistance, it reacts with a beautiful rebound, pushed up in the air as it springs onto its next adventure. The sound of its bouncing also adds to its charm, with a rhythmic beat that catches the ear in a pleasant way.",
