  "input": "",
  "output": "Parallel computing is a form of computing that divides a large task into smaller, more manageable subtasks and runs those subtasks simultaneously. By taking advantage of multiple processing cores on a single computer or multiple computers, the total computing time for the task is greatly reduced and results are processed faster. It is particularly useful for performing complex calculations and data analysis tasks.",
