  "input": "",
  "output": "The vocabulary of a 5-year-old typically consists of approximately 3,000 to 6,000 words. At age 7, a child's vocabulary usually grows to around 8,000 to 14,000 words. By this age, they are also able to understand more complex sentences and begin to use abstract terms. Additionally, a 7-year-old is able to recognize and understand more subtle connotations and nuances in language, such as sarcasm and jokes.",
