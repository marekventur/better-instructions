  "input": "",
  "output": "One way for people to reduce their environmental impact is to transition to a plant-based lifestyle by eliminating animal products from their diet. Another way is to reduce reliance on single-use plastics by switching to more eco-friendly reusable options such as metal straws, water bottles, and utensils. People should also look for green and sustainable alternatives to the products that they regularly use. This can include items such as furniture, clothing, soap, shampoo, and electronics. Finally, people can reduce their electricity and water consumption by switching to more energy-efficient devices and using natural resources responsibly.",
