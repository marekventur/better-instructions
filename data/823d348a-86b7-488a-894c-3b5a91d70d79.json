  "output": "One basketball drill that emphasizes hand-eye coordination is the Figure 8 Drill. This drill mimics the movement of a figure 8 with the dribbler moving the ball from outside the paint to attack the basket, passing through both his/her legs, in front and behind them, and reversing direction as needed. The dribbler works on one-handed dribbling as well as form, footwork, ball control, and hand-eye coordination.",
