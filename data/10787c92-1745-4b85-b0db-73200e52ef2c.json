  "output": "The stock market has experienced a surge in the past month due to various factors. Firstly, investors were encouraged by strong economic reports, including better-than-expected job growth figures. Secondly, the potential resolution of US-China trade tension boosted investor confidence. Finally, the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal was seen to provide stability and clarity to global markets. All of these factors have encouraged investors to return to risk-on assets, and the stock market has seen significant gains as a result.",
