  "instruction": "Describe the colour palette of a traditional Japanese bedroom.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Traditional Japanese bedrooms typically have muted earthy tones, with white near the windows and ceiling, browns, beiges and creams used on the walls, and dark brown and black used on the furniture. Earthy tones like greens, grays and blues may be used to create a calming atmosphere. Neutral colors may be used for decorations, such as nature-inspired art. Splashes of color may be used for accent pieces, like a bright red vase or cushions.",
