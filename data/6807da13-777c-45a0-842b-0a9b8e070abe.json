  "instruction": "Compose a report about the impact of global warming on the Arctic region.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The Arctic region has been significantly affected by global warming. The average temperature in the Arctic has risen twice as more as the rest of the world and the entire region is now estimated to be two to four degrees warmer than it was a few decades ago. This has had a profound effect on the Arctic ecosystem, leading to the melting of sea ice, forest fires, coastal erosion, and changes in animal migration patterns. Furthermore, the loss of reflective ice and snow that once cooled the region has led to further warming. The effects of global warming in the Arctic have a global reach, as it is projected to cause an increase in sea levels, changes in weather patterns, and the disruption of ocean food webs. It is essential to take immediate, meaningful action to reduce the emissions that contribute to climate change, in order to protect vulnerable communities, ecosystems, and economies.",
