  "output": "The Great Depression was a severe global economic downturn that lasted from 1929 to 1939. It was caused by several factors, including the stock market crash of 1929, structural weaknesses in the economy, low consumer spending, high unemployment, and a lack of confidence in the banking system. Other contributing factors included overproduction of commodities, reliance on borrowing to finance investments, agricultural overproduction, and a decrease in international trade.",
