  "output": "Jennifer had been planning the trip for months, saving money and getting all the supplies she and her friends would need for the trip. She was especially excited to be back in nature in the crisp and fresh air of the wilderness. She and her friends arrived at the camping ground, and quickly set up their tents. That night, they cooked delicious meals and had a wonderful time trading stories and singing around the campfire. In the morning, Jennifer and her friends rose with the sun and hiked through the lush forest nearby. As evening began to fall, they reluctantly made their way back to camp, rejuvenated by the beauty of nature.",
