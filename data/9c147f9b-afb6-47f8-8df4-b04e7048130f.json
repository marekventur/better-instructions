  "input": "",
  "output": "The game could involve a character searching for items such as sunlight, water and carbon dioxide in order to collect the ingredients necessary to produce food. The character would have to dodge dangers such as pollution, and could collect points by correctly assembling the ingredients and creating food. In the end, the game could explain the process of photosynthesis and why it is important for the environment.",
