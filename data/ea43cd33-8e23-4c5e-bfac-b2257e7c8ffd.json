  "input": "",
  "output": "Over the past year, I learned to embrace the unknown. I realized that in order to survive, I had to accept the uncertainty that came with each day. I chose to accept the changes, trust my intuition, and use this opportunity to grow as a person. I worked on my inner strength and resilience, put faith in myself that I would make it through, and took a leap of faith in new opportunities that came my way. \n\nI also welcomed new experiences and challenges, opened myself to new perspectives and skills, and embraced the idea that this period of my life would be a time of growth and personal development. I focused on what I could do in the present and channeled my energy into positive activities that could make a positive difference in my life. Above all, I reminded myself to be grateful for everything I had and use that gratitude to stay strong. \n\nThis was my way of embracing the unknown with courage, faith, and strength. Through these experiences, I have come out of the past year a better version of myself, feeling empowered and ready for whatever life brings my way.",
