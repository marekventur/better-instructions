  "output": "A daisy wheel printer is a type of typewriter-inspired impact printer that produces character glyphs by striking a shaped metal or plastic wheel with a hammer.  The wheel is divided into sections, each of which contains a different character.  During printing, the wheel quickly rotates to the desired character and the hammer strikes it, transferring an inked impression onto paper.  The daisy wheel printer was popular during the 1970s and 1980s, but has since been largely supplanted by newer technologies, such as laser and inkjet printers.",
