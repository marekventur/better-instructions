  "input": "",
  "output": "A market and a mall are quite different concepts. A market is a place where people buy and sell goods and services, usually within a specific area. They usually involve multiple vendors selling a variety of products. A mall, on the other hand, is a large indoor space where multiple stores and businesses are located under the same roof, offering convenience to shoppers. It is typically a commercial, retail, or entertainment center. Malls are significantly larger and are often multi-story buildings.",
