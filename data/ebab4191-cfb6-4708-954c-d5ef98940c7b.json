  "instruction": "Formulate a mathematical equation to express the movement of 100 g of a substance from a temperature of 273 K to a temperature of 293 K.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The equation for this calculation is Q = mc\u0394T, where Q is heat, m is mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and \u0394T is the change in temperature. Using this equation, the amount of heat required to move 100 g of a substance from a temperature of 273 K to 293 K is calculated as 100 g x 4.184 J/g\u00b0C x (293 K - 273 K) = 818.4 J.",
