  "instruction": "Identify the 5 major themes of Romeo and Juliet and provide an example of each.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Love: Romeo and Juliet\u2019s passionate love for each other, even in the face of the hostility between their two families, is one of the play\u2019s major themes. An example of this can be seen in Act II, Scene 2 when Romeo says, \u201cMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,/My love as deep; the more I give to thee,/The more I have, for both are infinite.\u201d\n2. Fate: Fate plays a huge role in the play, pretending to be a driving force throughout the tragic storyline. One example is when Friar Lawrence says to Juliet, \u201cThings have reach\u2019d the point,/Where the change of fortune may be seen,/But not revok'd.\u201d\n3. Family Honor: Family honor is visible in the extreme hatred between the Montagues and Capulets, and in the actions and words of both families. An example of this is when Tybalt tells Benvolio, \u201cBenefit as on, I will not endure it.\u201d\n4. Impulsiveness: Romeo and Juliet\u2019s impulsive decisions contribute to the eventual tragedy, especially in terms of their marriage. An example of this is when Romeo, despite Friar Lawrence's warnings, decides to marry Juliet after knowing her for only a day.\n5. Miscommunication: Miscommunication is a major factor in the play, leading the characters to unknowingly take actions that are harmful. An example of this is when the Friar\u2019s message to Romeo is not delivered, resulting in Romeo believing Juliet is dead and taking his own life.",
