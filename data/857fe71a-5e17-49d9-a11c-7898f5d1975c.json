  "instruction": "Describe the economic condition of China after the 2008 global banking crisis.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The 2008 global banking crisis had a significant impact on the Chinese economy. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, China saw a sharp decline in exports, capital flight, and a decrease in consumer confidence. These factors, combined with a decrease in household savings, put pressure on the Chinese government to respond. In response, the central government increased fiscal stimulus, increased consumer spending and relaxed capital controls. These policies helped China recover relatively quickly and the economy experienced a period of robust growth. In the years since 2008, the Chinese economy has become the second-largest economy in the world and the country continues to experience strong economic growth.",
