  "instruction": "Provide two compelling arguments to support the given opinion.",
  "input": "Online classes should be just as effective as traditional classes.",
  "output": "1. Online classes provide more flexibility and convenience as students can access learning materials anytime, anywhere. Additionally, they are less costly, as students do not need to pay for transportation or other costs associated with going to a physical classroom. \n2. Online classes also allow students to be more engaged with their learning environment and can even help them to be more organized. As students can watch lectures at their own pace, they can learn better and have more time for assignments. Additionally, online classes offer more opportunities for collaboration, as students can easily discuss and share ideas with each other using online tools.",
