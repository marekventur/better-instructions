  "input": "",
  "output": "Synthetic fibers are man-made and commonly made of polymers such as nylon or polyester. They are strong, durable, and typically less expensive than natural fibers. Natural fibers are grown from plants or animals and include silk, cotton, wool, and hemp. They tend to be softer, more comfortable, breathable, and usually higher quality. However, natural fibers can also be more expensive and less durable than synthetic fibers.",
