  "input": "",
  "output": "The law of supply and demand has a major influence on stock prices. If demand for a stock increases, the price will generally rise, and if there is an abundance of supply, the price will fall. As investors are constantly buying, selling and trading stocks, the demand for and supply of each stock will affect its price in the stock market.",
