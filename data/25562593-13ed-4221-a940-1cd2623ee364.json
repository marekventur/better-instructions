  "output": "Once two lovers met and crossed beneath the stars,\nA destined love, even for just a few hours.\nFast and passionate, it was never meant to last,\nFor their love was star-crossed, swept away all too fast.\n\nThe moon, she looked upon them with a gentle glance,\nBut the lovers, too soon, their love was set to chance.\nFor fate had not smiled, they were never meant to be,\nTwo star-crossed lovers in a world of misery.\n\nTheir love was so strong and yet destined to fail,\nThough they tried to keep it safe, there was no hope to prevail.\nEven though they longed to try, there was no way they could break free.\nIn the end, time proved too cruel, star-crossed lovers were doomed to flee.",
