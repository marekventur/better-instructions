  "output": "Athletes need endurance in order to perform in their sport for extended periods of time. Endurance can be defined as the ability to endure extended physical exertion with minimal fatigue. Athletic performance requires sustained levels of physical and mental energy and an athlete's endurance can determine the length of time they are able to perform at their peak. Endurance is not just physical strength, it is also mental and emotional stamina. Good endurance helps athletes maintain mental focus, overcome fatigue, and stay motivated.",
