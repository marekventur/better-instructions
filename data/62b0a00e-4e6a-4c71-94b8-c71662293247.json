  "output": "Detective John McRay was on the hunt for a missing person. He had been looking for weeks with no avail, and it was slowly beginning to take its toll on him. He couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to the case than what he was seeing. His intuition was telling him that the missing person had been taken, not just strayed away, but he couldn't find anyone who could shed light on the situation.\n\nWith no leads, he decided to take a break from the case and visit a small diner. However, when he got to the diner, he noticed a mysterious figure in the corner booth, wearing a wide brimmed hat and a black overcoat. Intrigued, John ventured to the booth, but as soon as he got there, the figure had vanished, leaving only a small, black envelope.\n\nInside the envelope, he found an old photograph with a clue to the missing person's whereabouts. Thinking to himself, John knew that the missing person must be in serious danger and without a moment to lose, he raced back to his house to get all of his detective tools and begin his investigation.",
