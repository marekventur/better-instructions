  "output": "Creating an effective outline for a research paper is an important step in the writing process. It helps you plan and organize the ideas and evidence that will support your argument. First, brainstorm key points and jot them down in a hierarchical structure. To create the outline, start by writing the central topic at the top of a sheet of paper. Then list the sub-topics and supporting ideas in the order you plan to discuss them in the paper. Finally, arrange the sub-topics in a logical order and fill in details beneath each main point.",
