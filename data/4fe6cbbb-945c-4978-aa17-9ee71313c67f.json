  "output": "Sue was a 20-year-old student living on her own for the first time and feeling excited about the possibilities that her newly found independence afforded her. She awoke early that morning and had breakfast, before heading off to her classes. She was an exemplary student, and worked diligently in her classes. After the lectures, she left the university and went to the library, wanting to utilize the time she had between classes to read up on some interesting topics she had encountered in lecture.\n\nLater, she wandered to the local market, enjoying the sunshine and people watching. She conversed with the vendors, picking up tidbits of information and stories. After the market, she returned home and made herself a light meal. She relaxed in her room with a good book, and later in the afternoon, she went to meet her friends at the caf\u00e9. They talked, laughed and enjoyed each other's company before Sue had to leave for the last lecture of the day.\n\nAfter the lecture, Sue joined her friends again, this time at the theatre. They watched a romantic comedy and shared a few jokes. When the movie ended, it was late and Sue decided to head home. On the way she bought a cup of hot chocolate from a street vendor and enjoyed the peaceful moment before she went home.\n\nArriving at home, Sue took a hot shower and changed into her pajamas. She quickly reviewed the notes from her classes, before finally crawling into bed and falling asleep, content with the day she had.",
