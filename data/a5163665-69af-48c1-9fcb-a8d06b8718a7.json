  "input": "",
  "output": "An artificial neuron takes input signals from several other neurons and processes them. It then determines whether to fire an output signal. If the neuron fires an output signal, it will influence other neurons either positively or negatively. The strength of the connection between neurons is determined by weights which are learned by the network over time. The artificial neuron then combines each of the inputs with a weighting and a bias to produce an output. This output is then passed on to other neurons or a final output neuron. The process is repeated for all neurons in the artificial neural network.",
