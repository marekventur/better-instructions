It also creates new markets and industries, brings in foreign investment, and creates taxes. By increasing productivity, industrialization can improve standards of living and create a more sophisticated and diverse economy that produces a wide range of products, services, and technologies. Industrialization also encourages technological innovation and provides the necessary infrastructure for new advances in technology. Finally, it enables countries to participate in globalized trade, thus improving their overall economic standing.",
