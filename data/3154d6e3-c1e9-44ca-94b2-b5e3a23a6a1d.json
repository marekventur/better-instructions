  "input": "",
  "output": "The government should take the following steps to reduce food waste:\n\n1. Make food waste reduction a priority in government policy. This should include providing incentives for businesses to reduce their food waste and increasing public awareness of food waste. \n\n2. Invest in new technologies to reduce food waste. This includes investing in new packing and storage systems to keep food fresh for longer and investing in food distribution networks to reduce food waste through efficient delivery. \n\n3. Increase access to fresh, healthy food for low-income households. This could include creating new food banks and Farmer's Markets to make fresh produce available to those who need it the most.",
