  "output": "Common types of layout in websites include vertical stacked layout, grid-based layout and magazine-style layout. Vertical stacked layout organizes content in a vertical linear way to maximize the use of the visible space. Grid-based layout, on the other hand, is characterized by its use of equal-sized rectangular boxes which facilitate the efficient organization of content. Magazine-style layout is based on traditional newspaper design which features multiple columns, large headline images and captivating visuals.",
