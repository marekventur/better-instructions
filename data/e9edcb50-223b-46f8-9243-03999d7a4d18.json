  "input": "",
  "output": "Nuclear energy has been presented as a possible solution to our energy needs, but it is a dangerous, unreliable, and expensive solution. Nuclear energy carries the risk of nuclear accidents, which have already caused catastrophic damage in Russia and Japan, and can have lasting consequences for generations. Nuclear energy is also extremely expensive, requiring billions in capital to be allocated for its production and maintenance. Finally, nuclear waste can remain dangerous for thousands of years, requiring extensive mitigation efforts to ensure that radiation doesn\u2019t accidentally contaminate our biosphere. In short, there are far more efficient and safe ways of producing the energy that we need, making nuclear energy unnecessary and dangerous.",
