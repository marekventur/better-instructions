  "input": "",
  "output": "Democracy and autocracy differ in that democracy is a system of government by the people, for the people, where citizens have the power to make decisions with their vote, while autocracy is a system of government in which the supreme power is held by a single person or group of people with little to no input from the people. Democracy allows for greater freedom, rights, and representation, while autocracy grants all power to the ruler and limits freedoms and rights.",
