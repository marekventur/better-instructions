  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a for-profit and a non-profit company is the purpose for which it is formed. For-profit companies are formed with the goal of generating profits for its owners or shareholders, while non-profits are formed to benefit society or a certain cause. For-profits generally make decisions based on maximizing profits and typically distribute profits directly to shareholders, while non-profits are able to receive donations or grants and use them to support their mission, rather than distribute profits to shareholders. Additionally, non-profit organizations are often exempt from paying certain taxes.",
