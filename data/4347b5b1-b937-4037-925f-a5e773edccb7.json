  "output": "An animal shelter should have secure fencing and outdoor areas for exercise, with shade and shelter from the elements. It should have indoor areas separated into different sections for different species. The shelter should also have medical facilities, with a veterinarian and staff to monitor the animals' health, as well as training areas to help socialize the animals and prepare them for adoption. Additionally, the shelter should have administrative areas, such as a reception, storage and break rooms.",
