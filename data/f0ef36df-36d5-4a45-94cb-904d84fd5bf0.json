  "output": "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer is given labeled training data and is asked to learn a mapping from input to output. On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require any labeled data, and the goal is to find structure in the data without any external help. Supervised learning is used for tasks such as classification, regression, and forecasting, while unsupervised learning is useful for tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction. Supervised learning models are trained on labeled data and therefore require human input, while unsupervised learning models must learn from raw data which does not require human input. \n\nSupervised learning algorithms can also be used to find patterns in the data, but this requires labeled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms are able to autonomously find patterns in data based on their own intrinsic knowledge.",
