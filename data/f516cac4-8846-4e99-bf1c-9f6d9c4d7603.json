  "instruction": "Identify the key components of the following system.",
  "input": "System:\nA machine learning system to predict the weather",
  "output": "The key components of this system are data acquisition, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, model training and evaluation, and model deployment. Data acquisition involves collecting weather data from various sources. Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data and preparing it for further analysis. Feature engineering involves selecting the most relevant features for predicting the weather. Model selection involves choosing an appropriate algorithm for the prediction task. Model training and evaluation involve using the selected algorithm to train and test the model. Finally, model deployment involves deploying the trained model in a production environment.",
