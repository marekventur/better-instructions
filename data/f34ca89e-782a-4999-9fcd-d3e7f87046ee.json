  "output": "Dear [school board]\n\nI am writing to express my concern about the increasing tuition fees in our school, and to request that you consider reducing them.\n\nThe current fees are too high for many families and have forced them to make difficult financial sacrifices. Many parents already have depleted their savings and are struggling to pay the current fees. As a result, many students are unable to attend school and their educational opportunities are limited.\n\nI understand that the school has certain financial obligations, but these should not be at the expense of students\u2019 education. I urge you to find other sources of revenue and consider reducing tuition fees to make education more accessible to all families.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n[Your Name]",
