  "output": "Steps to check a car engine: \n1. Check the oil level: pull out the dipstick, wipe it off, insert it back into the engine, and pull it out again. The oil level should be at maximum. \n2. Check the oil color: the oil should be golden brown or light tan; black oil means it is time to change the oil filter. \n3. Check the radiator fluid: open the coolant reservoir and check the fluid level. \n4. Check the battery: make sure all the cables are connected securely and that there is no corrosion. \n5. Check the spark plugs: examine each spark plug for spark strength, correct gap setting and wear. \n6. Check the brake pads: look for wear and tear or any foreign objects caught in the brake pad. \n7. Check the hoses: make sure all the hoses are secure and well connected.",
