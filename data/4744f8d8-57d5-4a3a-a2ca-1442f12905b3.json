  "input": "",
  "output": "The structure of the solar system can be compared to a wheel, with the Sun at the center. The planets each hold a \"spoke\" position, orbiting the wheel at varying distances from the central star. The asteroids occupy a similar position but at much greater distances from the Sun. The wheel is further held in place by two important forces--gravity, acting from within, and the just-as-powerful force of momentum pushing from the outside, aiding in momentum and balance.",
