  "input": "",
  "output": "A five-day school week would benefit students and faculty in numerous ways. First, it would provide students with more time off to help them relax and rest, making them more focused and energized while in class. Additionally, five-day weeks would allow teachers to include more detailed lessons in the curriculum and make more effective use of class time. Finally, shorter weeks would reduce the number of hours for students to work on projects and assignments, allowing them more time for other activities such as sports, extra-curriculars, and extracurricular activities.",
