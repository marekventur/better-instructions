  "output": "A computer processes data by first taking the data from some source (e.g., keyboard, network) and storing it in its memory. The computer then interprets and executes a set of instructions (programs) based on the data it has stored. Finally, the computer produces an output based on the data it has processed. This output can be, for example, a graphical user interface (GUI), numerical results, or physical outputs such as robot movements.",
