  "instruction": "What is the difference between articulatory and acoustic phonetics?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Articulatory phonetics studies the physical production of speech sounds by studying the positions of the vocal organs such as the tongue, lips, and the vocal tract. Acoustic phonetics, on the other hand, focuses on how sounds are transmitted through air and characterizes the physical properties of speech sounds that make them distinguishable for the listener. Acoustic phonetics is used to study features such as pitch and intensity, which are not as easily discerned in articulatory phonetics.",
