  "output": "Four diseases caused by cold temperatures are hypothermia, frostbite, chilblains, and trench foot. Hypothermia occurs when body temperature falls below 95\u00b0F and can lead to organ failure. Frostbite is a cold induced injury where portions of the skin freeze and can result in loss of tissue or even amputation. Chilblains are itchy and painful skin rashes caused by exposure to the cold. Finally, trench foot is caused by prolonged exposure to wet and cold conditions, leading to extreme discomfort and even infection.",
