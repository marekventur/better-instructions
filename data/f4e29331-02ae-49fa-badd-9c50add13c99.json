  "input": "",
  "output": "The typical trajectory of a tennis serve is quite dynamic. It typically starts with a toss of the ball slightly above and in front of the server's head. The server then makes contact with the ball with the racket and propels it to an upward angle in the general direction of the service box. The ball is sent into an arc that continues in an upward and forward trajectory until it lands within the service box.",
