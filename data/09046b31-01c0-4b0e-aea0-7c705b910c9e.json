  "input": "",
  "output": "The biggest difference between a car and a motorcycle is the amount of protection they provide. Cars usually have four walls, a roof and a seatbelt, which offer more protection than the open-air seat and lack of a roof provided by a motorcycle. Additionally, cars have larger engines and typically require more fuel, while motorcycles tend to be more fuel efficient. Car engines also tend to be more powerful, which makes cars more suitable for long distances. Motorcycles are generally better for short trips and in congested urban areas where their smaller size offers more maneuverability.",
