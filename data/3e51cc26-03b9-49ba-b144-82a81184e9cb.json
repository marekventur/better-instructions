  "input": "Position = 7C",
  "output": "If the checker piece is in position 7C, the suggested next move would be to move the checker diagonally to position 8B. This move would capture an opponent's piece if there is one in position 8B. If there is not an opponent's piece in that position, the checker piece can remain in 7C.",
