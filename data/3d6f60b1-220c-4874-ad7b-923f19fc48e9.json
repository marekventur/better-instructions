  "input": "",
  "output": "The hypothesis that multitasking decreases an individual's productivity is generally accepted by many scientists, psychologists, and educators. Numerous studies have shown that multitasking leads to decreased focus and cognitive resources, which affects the quality of work. It has also been suggested that multitasking disrupts short-term and long-term memory, negatively impacts decision-making abilities, and ultimately leads to lower productivity. \n\nFor example, a study by the University of London found that when participants were asked to switch tasks multiple times, their IQ dropped by more than ten points on average. Additionally, research from Harvard University suggests that multitasking can cause a decrease in efficiency of up to 40%.\n\nTherefore, it seems that multitasking has a negative impact on one's productivity. Ultimately, it is best to focus on one task at a time in order to get the best results.",
