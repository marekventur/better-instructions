  "instruction": "Identify a unique solution to reduce single-use plastic waste.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One potential solution to reducing single-use plastic waste is to encourage businesses and consumers to choose biodegradable packaging materials and products. Biodegradable packaging, such as packaging made from cornstarch and other plant-based materials, can be used to package items and then safely break down over time. This would reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, and it would also reduce the amount of plastic pollution in our oceans.",
