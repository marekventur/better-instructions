  "output": "Abstract art is a form of non-representational art that is heavily influenced by the idea of personal expression and subjectivity. It is characterized by its use of unconventional techniques, such as distorted shapes and color blocking, to evoke feelings and communicate ideas without relying on traditional images or forms. \n\nAn abstract painting will often contain elements of both representational and abstract art; however, it does not feature recognizable images or figures. Instead, abstract works make use of shapes, colors, and brushstrokes to create an emotional response. The purpose of abstract art is to use vibrant colors and shapes to convey an idea or emotion without relying on the depiction of a realistic scene or object. \n\nAbstract art has been around since the 19th century, when artists began pushing the boundaries of art beyond the traditional forms that existed in previous eras. The advent of abstract art is credited to Wassily Kandinsky, a Russian painter and art theorist who is widely considered to be the father of abstract art. \n\nAbstract art is often associated with the likes of Picasso, Kandinsky, and Matisse, but this style of art can be extremely varied and personal. Many modern artists have incorporated elements of abstract art into their works, creating vivid and dynamic paintings that emphasize individual expression. \n\nAbstract art is a great way to express emotion and feelings without the use of traditional images. It encourages us to think about how we see the world and how we can convey ideas, thoughts, and feelings using unconventional shapes and colors. Abstract art has allowed artists to explore new depths of emotion and share their visions with their audience.",
