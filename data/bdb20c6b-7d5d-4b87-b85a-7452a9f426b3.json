  "input": "PacMan is located at (1,1), and the goal node is at (3,3).",
  "output": "PacMan can traverse the grid in the following order: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). This solution follows the A* heuristic search algorithm, exploring the lowest cost option available until it reaches the goal node.",
