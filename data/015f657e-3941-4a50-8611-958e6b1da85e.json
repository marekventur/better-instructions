One day, Elle decided to venture outside the wall to explore the world. She met a talking cat who told her of a powerful sorcerer living in a nearby castle. Elle set out to find the sorcerer and ask for his help. After a long journey, she finally arrived at his castle and asked him to help her break the spell that kept her kingdom locked away. The sorcerer granted her wish and the wall was broken, allowing Elle and her people to freely explore their world.",
