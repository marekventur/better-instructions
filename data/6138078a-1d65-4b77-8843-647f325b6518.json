  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to determine the similarity between two biological sequences is to use a dynamic programming algorithm such as Smith-Waterman or Needleman-Wunsch. These algorithms compare the sequences of biological data and calculate the similarity score based on the number of similar characters or elements between the sequences.",
