  "output": "The mission began with great optimism. A team of astronauts had been sent on a mission to explore a distant planet. It was predicted to be an easy mission with no risks involved. However, what the team didn't know was that the planet was home to a hostile alien species that would quickly hunt them down and attempt to take over the ship. The team found themselves in a fight for survival and despite their best efforts, they were unable to make it back to Earth.",
