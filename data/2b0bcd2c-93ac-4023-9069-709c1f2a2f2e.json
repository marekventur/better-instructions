  "input": "",
  "output": "An electronic voting system is an automated system used to collect and tabulate votes. Generally, the process includes a voter logging into the system, making their selections, and pressing a button to cast their vote. The votes are then stored on a secure database and the results can be tabulated in real-time. This system is more efficient than traditional manual voting systems, as it eliminates the need for paper ballots, simplifies the vote counting process, and can provide instant results.",
