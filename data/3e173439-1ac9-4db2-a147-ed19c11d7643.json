  "input": "",
  "output": "Deep in the woods, a bear wandered alone. He was a lonely bear, with nobody around to share his adventures. He used to love exploring the tall trees and the exciting noises he heard every day. One day, as he was walking, he heard a particularly loud noise. He stopped and looked for its source, and saw a young girl in a nearby clearing. They made eye contact and the bear's heart beat faster. He knew he wanted to get to know her, so he slowly walked towards her. She smiled at him and asked him to join her for a picnic. The bear was so excited, he couldn't believe it. He found his first friend in the woods.",
