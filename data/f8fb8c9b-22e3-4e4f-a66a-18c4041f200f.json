  "input": "",
  "output": "The web-based platform should have a user registration page that requires essential information for the user profile, such as name, username, email, date of birth, gender, and other personal details. The platform should also have a profile page where registered users can view and edit their profile information. This page should include fields to enter profile photo, address, interests, biographical information, and contact details.\n\nThe platform should also have user login and logout functionality, with secure user authentication measures. It should also have a password reset feature and an encrypted password storage system to protect user data. Additionally, the platform should allow users to control the privacy settings of their profile information and control who can view the profile and the profile details they can view.",
