  "instruction": "Describe the differences between an online store and a brick-and-mortar store.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An online store is an online presence for a business that allows customers to browse, purchase, and pay for goods and services through the internet, typically from the comfort of their own home. A brick-and-mortar store, on the other hand, is a physical store where customers can personally enter and browse products in order to purchase them. Online stores typically eliminate the need for a customer to travel to the store, whereas a brick-and-mortar store requires a customer to physically enter the store in order to purchase goods. Additionally, online stores normally have access to a much larger range of products due to the amount of vendors who are able to list and ship goods worldwide, whereas a brick-and-mortar store may only have access to goods from certain locations or from certain vendors.",
