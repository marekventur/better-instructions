  "input": "",
  "output": "Learning rate is a hyperparameter used in machine learning algorithms which determines how quickly the algorithm is able to learn from data. It is used to control the amount of change that is applied to the weights of the model during each iteration of training. A higher learning rate can help the algorithm converge to a solution faster, while a lower learning rate can help it find a more accurate solution. The optimal learning rate for an algorithm is highly dependent on the specific problem it is trying to solve.",
