  "output": "Anticipatory customer service is focused on anticipating the needs of customers and addressing them before they arise. It involves gaining insights into customer preferences, developing processes and business models that anticipate customer needs, and leveraging technology to improve the customer experience. Reactive customer service focuses on responding quickly and effectively to customer requests. This type of customer service requires a company to have an efficient system in place to monitor customer interactions, determine customer needs, and provide timely responses.",
