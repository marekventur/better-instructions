Analyze hiring trends over time to look for an increase in desired people skills, such as interpersonal and communication skills. \n2. Survey employees to assess the perceived importance of people skills in the workplace and analyze any changes over time. \n3. Evaluate performance reviews to determine if people skills are playing a larger role in employees' success.\n4. Interview hiring managers to get their perspectives on the importance of people skills in their hiring decisions. \n5. Analyze the types of job descriptions that are being posted to identify if they are emphasizing people skills more than before. \n// end of the output.//",
