  "input": "",
  "output": "The butterfly lifecycle has four distinct stages: egg, larvae (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. The egg is laid by an adult female butterfly and hatched after a few days. The larvae stage usually lasts 1-3 weeks and is when the caterpillar eats and grows until it reaches its full size. During the pupa stage, the caterpillar's body re-organizes and it forms the chrysalis. The adult butterfly emerges from the pupa after a few weeks and is ready to reproduce and lay more eggs.",
