  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of a real-world application of a neural network is image classification. Neural networks can be used to classify images by recognizing landmarks and objects in the images. For example, it can be used for facial recognition to detect the facial features of a person\u2019s face. It can also be used for identifying medical images such as X-rays and MRI scans, as well as for recognizing objects and identifying handwriting. Neural networks are also used for autonomous vehicles that rely on real-time image recognition to safely navigate. Other applications include natural language processing and text summarization, as well as stock market predictions. Neural networks also have applications in robotics and autonomous systems, as well as for automated analytics and machine learning.",
