  "input": "",
  "output": "Renewable energy is a powerful and sustainable option for powering homes. It utilizes natural resources like sunshine, wind, and water to produce electricity and can be used in a variety of ways. Solar panels are the most widely used option for large-scale home energy solutions, and are capable of heating a home and producing electricity. Wind turbines can provide clean energy production and are increasingly used in residential areas. Hydroelectric energy utilizes the natural power of rivers to generate electricity and is popular in areas with ample water sources. Finally, geothermal energy also uses the heat from the Earth to generate energy and is becoming more and more popular in residential applications. Ultimately, renewable energy offers a clean and efficient way to bring power to homes.",
