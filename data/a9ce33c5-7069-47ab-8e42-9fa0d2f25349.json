  "input": "",
  "output": "A neural network is different from a regular computer program because it is an artificial intelligence system that uses interconnected nodes, or neurons, to generate patterns from data and make predictions, whereas a regular computer program is a set of instructions for the computer to execute. Neural networks are also less structured and more complex than regular computer programs.",
