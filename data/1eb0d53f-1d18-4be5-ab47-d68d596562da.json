  "output": "Paul and Anna had been friends since they were young. As they grew up in the same neighborhood, they grew closer, eventually becoming inseparable. They were always adventuring together, even when they were too young to know what they were getting into. They'd go on hikes, explore abandoned buildings, and play make-believe in the woods. \n\nAs they got older, they decided to go to the same college and live in the same dorm room. They were each other's closest friends and confidants, always ready to lend a listening ear or an outpouring of support. \n\nOne night, after a stressful exam, they decided to make a special trip to their childhood home to reconnect with their roots. There, they found all the things they used to do together as kids. They reminisced about the time they chased lightning, the time they drew fairy houses in the dirt, and the time they both accidentally got caught in the rain and had to run for a shelter. \n\nThat night, Paul and Anna knew nothing could really break their bond. Through any obstacle, they promised to remain friends.",
