  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a young girl who lived deep in the forest. She loved to explore nature and follow its trails, particularly the ones that wound their way around the old temple she had found one day. She often went inside the temple and admired its many carvings and sculptures, marveling at how it had remained untouched for so long. One day, as she was exploring, she noticed an entrance to a hidden chamber at the back of the temple. She entered the chamber and found within it an ancient relic that seemed to be imbued with magical powers. Excited by her discovery, she quickly left the chamber with the relic in hand and left the temple behind. From that moment on, she kept it with her, never letting it out of her sight.",
