  "output": "Japan has had a long history of capitalism dating back to the early Meiji period from 1868 to 1912. During this period, the Japanese government invested heavily in new industrial enterprises and pushed for economic modernization, leading to the growth of large zaibatsu corporations. The zaibatsu further pushed for economic growth through increased investment in infrastructure, technology and foreign investments. This period was marked by increased foreign investment, marketization of the economy, the development of a strong educational system, and the emergence of an efficient capitalist system. After WW II, Japan's economy recovered quickly and by the 1960s it had become the second largest economy in the world. This was facilitated by Japan's adoption of a market-oriented economy and heavy reliance on exports. There has been a continued growth of the economy since then and Japan is currently the third largest economy in the world. The Japanese government has continued to push for a more open economy and has invested heavily in research and development, making the country a leader in innovation and technology.",
