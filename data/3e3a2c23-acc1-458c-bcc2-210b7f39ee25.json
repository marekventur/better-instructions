  "instruction": "Collaborate with a fellow learner to create a plan for making a mini catapult.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Our plan for making a mini catapult requires five materials: a length of balsa wood, two thin wooden dowels, three rubber bands, a piece of fabric, and glue. We would need to cut the balsa wood into four pieces - two of them measuring fifteen cm in length, and the other two measuring twelve cm in length. The two twelve cm pieces will be used for the sides of the catapult, while the fifteen cm pieces will be used for the cross pieces. We will use one of the dowels to make the throwing arm, while the other can be used as an axle. We will tie the three rubber bands together and secure them to the sides of the catapult, allowing us to attach the throwing arm to the rubber bands for added power. Finally, we will wrap the fabric around the axle for a better grip, and glue all the pieces together to complete the mini catapult.",
