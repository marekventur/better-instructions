  "input": "",
  "output": "To reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in the next 10 years, we need to focus on renewable energy sources and clean transportation. We need to expand the use of solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources, and shift away from fossil fuels. We can also promote public transportation, electric cars, and bicycles, while investing in new technologies such as electric aircraft. Additionally, governments can incentivize industries and citizens to use energy efficient appliances, adopt sustainable farming practices, and plant trees to absorb carbon dioxide.",
