  "instruction": "Explain why magma is more dense than lava",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Magma is more dense than lava because it is a mix of molten and solid rock found beneath Earth's surface, whereas lava is molten rock that has been released onto Earth's surface. Magma contains more minerals and suspended material, making it more dense than lava. Additionally, the deeper the magma is located under the earth's surface, the higher the pressure and temperature will be, further increasing its density.",
