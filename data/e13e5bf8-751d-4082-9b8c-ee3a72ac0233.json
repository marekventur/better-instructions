  "output": "John was a cranky old man who lived in a small town. He was tall and thin, with a dusting of grey hair on his head and a greying beard. He was always grumbling about something and no one ever wanted to get too close in case he exploded with anger. He would often be found sitting in his rocking chair on the porch, muttering to himself and scowling at everyone who would dare to pass by. Despite his grumpiness, he was loved by the people of the town and they knew that deep down, he really did care.",
