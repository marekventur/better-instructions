As she watched her friends laughing and running around on the court, she could feel the spirit of the game enter her soul. She was determined to make it to the big leagues one day.\n\nToday, Mia and her friends were playing their first big game against the town's best players. They had been practicing for weeks, and Mia had the feeling this was her moment to shine. The first quarter started, and soon enough Mia was on the court, leading her team to a strong start. As the game went on, Mia's skill, agility and leadership spoke for itself, and it was clear she was the driving force of the team. Mia scored points with every move she made, and was ecstatic when her team won the last point. Mia and her friends leaped in the air with joy and hugged each other, knowing they had won. As Mia looked ahead, she knew she was closer than ever to achieving her dreams.",
