  "input": "",
  "output": "My morning exercise routine would consist of a few stretches to start, such as gentle neck rolls and shoulder stretches. Then I would move on to dynamic stretching, like walking lunges, abdominal twists, and yoga poses. After that, I would do some cardio exercises such as jogging, jumping jacks, or running in place. Finally, I would end with some strength training and core exercises, such as push-ups, squats, and planks.",
