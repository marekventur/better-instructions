  "input": "Subtract 3 from 4, add 2, and multiply by 7.",
  "output": "The algorithm works by subtracting 3 from 4, which gives a result of 1. Then it adds 2 to the result, giving a new result of 3. Finally, it multiplies 3 by 7, resulting in a final answer of 21. Thus, the result of the algorithm is 21.",
