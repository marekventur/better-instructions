  "input": "",
  "output": "In particle physics, Harmonic Oscillators are used to describe the behavior of particles and systems made of multiple particles in a variety of ways. A harmonic oscillator is a system which displays periodic motion, meaning the amplitude of its motion is periodically repeated over a certain amount of time. In particle physics, this property is used to describe the motion of particles in an electromagnetic or gravitational field, or from interactions with other particles. It can also be used to describe the motion of a particle confined by a potential.",
