  "input": "Question: Does truth exist outside of our perception?",
  "output": "Yes, truth exists outside of our perception. We may experience truth differently based on our individual perspectives, but the underlying reality remains the same. The world is shaped by physical laws and principles that we can observe and study regardless of our personal biases or experiences. In this sense, truth exists not only within our individual perceptions, but also beyond them.",
