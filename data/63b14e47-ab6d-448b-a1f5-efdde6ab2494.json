  "output": "I was working on a project to develop a medical device that was designed to reduce the number of medical errors that could occur in an operating room. The device had been designed with input from doctors and nurses, but the project was behind schedule due to difficulty achieving the required accuracy. To solve this issue, I worked with the engineering team to design a system where medical images were augmented with augmented reality technology to provide enhanced accuracy in surgical procedures. We were able to reduce the number of medical errors significantly and completed the project in the required time-frame.",
