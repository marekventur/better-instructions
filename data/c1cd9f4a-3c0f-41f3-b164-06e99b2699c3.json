  "output": "A safety plan for schools in the event of an armed intruder should include steps for staff and students to take before, during, and after an intruder enters the premises. Before an intruder enters, staff should regularly practice drills and teach students what to do if there is an emergency. During an intruder's presence, staff should secure classrooms, institute a lockdown procedure, and inform authorities. After the intruder has left, staff should provide crisis support to students and assess the safety of the premises.",
