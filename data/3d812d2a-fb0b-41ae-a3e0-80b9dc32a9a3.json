  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of widely used service that uses implicit authentication is online banking services. Banks require customers to use a username and password combination to access their account through a web portal, but banks can also recognize customers attempting to login from their device or the same IP address. Banks will often allow access to a customer's account if it detects activity that can be linked to a customer, such as a stored cookie, which serves as an implicit authentication. This helps prevent fraud, since the customer's device or IP address must match their account to gain access.",
