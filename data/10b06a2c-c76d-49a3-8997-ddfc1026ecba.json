  "output": "It was a cold, windy night and two people were standing in the middle of an empty street. One of them was a young man, the other an older man. They were both in a heated argument, the younger man saying that he wasn't ready for the older one to go. The older man had decided to go away on a journey and the younger man couldn't bear to let him go. \nHowever, the older man was determined to pursue his journey. The younger man was heartbroken. He begged the older man to stay and promised to take care of everything that he wouldn't have time for. Finally, the older man conceded and promised to come back soon. With a heavy heart, the younger man watched the older man walk away and vanish in the darkness.",
