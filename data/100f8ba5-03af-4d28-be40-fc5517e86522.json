  "input": "",
  "output": "A castle defense strategy should begin by fortifying the castle's walls and gates. Construct a lookout tower or two to ensure that any potential incoming attacks can be spotted in advance. Secure all weapons and ammunition, and deploy them in strategic locations around the perimeter and also on the walls. Prepare for potential sieges by stockpiling food, medicine, and other supplies. Remain vigilant and keep guard posts active, and establish a communication network between them to alert of any threats. In the event of an attack, use archers and soldiers to defend against enemy forces.",
