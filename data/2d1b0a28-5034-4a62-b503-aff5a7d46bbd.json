  "output": "Photosynthesis plays an important role in ecosystems. It is the process by which green plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. This oxygen can then be used by animals to breathe, and the glucose can be used as energy by plants and animals. Photosynthesis is essential for the health of ecosystems, as it produces the oxygen required for organisms to survive, as well as providing the energy for plants to grow.",
