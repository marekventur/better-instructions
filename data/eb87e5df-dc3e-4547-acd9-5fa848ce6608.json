  "input": "An artificial intelligence-powered system for automated customer service.",
  "output": "The feasibility of an artificial intelligence-powered system for automated customer service depends on several factors, including the availability of training data, the complexity of the customer service tasks, and the computing resources available. The project is likely to require a substantial investment in both engineers and computing resources to implement an effective AI solution. But, given the right resources and available training data, the project is certainly feasible.",
