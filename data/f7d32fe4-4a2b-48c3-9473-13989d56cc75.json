  "input": "",
  "output": "The song should feature a 12-bar blues chord progression in a jazz style. The chord progression will consist of the I, IV, V and I chords. The accompaniment should feature a walking bassline, and the melody should be improvised using a jazz-inspired improvisational language. The song should transition between sections, while still using the 12-bar blues structure. Instruments such as piano, saxophone, guitar, and drums could be used to create the accompaniment.",
