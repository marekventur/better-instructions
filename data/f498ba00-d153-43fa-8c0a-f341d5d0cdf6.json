  "input": "",
  "output": "A DNA molecule consists of two strands of nucleotides spiraling around one another in a double helix shape. Each strand is made up of phosphate groups and the four nitrogenous bases: guanine (G), adenine (A), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Each base is connected to a sugar molecule, making up the sugar-phosphate backbone of a DNA strand. The strands are linked together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases: A-T, G-C, forming base pairs. These base pairs form the \"rungs\" of the DNA ladder, with a complete ladder representing one turn of the double helix structure.",
