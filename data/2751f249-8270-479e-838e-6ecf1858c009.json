  "instruction": "Provide a solution to reduce pollution caused by burning oil.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One solution to reduce pollution caused by burning oil is to shift to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal sources. Renewable energy sources produce far fewer emissions than oil and have the potential to generate far more power, meaning that eventually oil burning can become obsolete. Governments can incentivize individuals, businesses, and communities to switch to renewable energy sources, providing tax credits and subsidies to those who make the switch. Additionally, governments can invest in development of renewable options such as solar panels, wind farms, and geothermal energy. Finally, governments can set mandates, setting goals to reduce emissions and encouraging more use of renewable energy sources.",
