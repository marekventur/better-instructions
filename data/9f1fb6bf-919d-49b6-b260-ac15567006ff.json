  "output": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computer program designed to simulate the behavior of neurons in the human brain. It is made up of neurons that process information and communicate with each other to solve a given problem. ANNs can be used to recognize patterns, classify data, make predictions, and generate natural language. They are often used in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing.",
