  "input": "",
  "output": "One plan for reduced consumption of fossil fuels is to encourage the use of renewable energy sources. This plan aims to provide incentives for the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. These sources are plentiful, non-polluting, and cost-effective. Additionally, governments should mandate the use of renewable energy sources by providing subsidies and incentives to both consumers and producers. There should also be regulations in place to reduce the emissions of harmful gases into the atmosphere, as well as an increase in the efficiency of existing energy systems to further reduce emissions.",
