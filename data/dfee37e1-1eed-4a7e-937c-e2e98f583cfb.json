  "output": "Five rules for following best practice when coding include using code comments to document programs, writing code in small blocks, avoiding the use of global variables, using consistent naming conventions and formatting, and monitoring memory leakage. Code comments should include a brief description of the code and any assumptions made. Code should be written in small blocks to make it easier to debug. Global variables should be avoided, as they can lead to unpredictable results. The use of naming conventions and formatting should be consistent to ensure readability and understanding. Finally, memory leakage should be monitored to ensure memory resources are being properly managed.",
