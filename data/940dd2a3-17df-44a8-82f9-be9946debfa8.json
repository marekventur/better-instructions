  "instruction": "Imagine a spacecraft docking with an alien space station. Describe what it might look like.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The spacecraft cautiously edges closer to the alien space station as its engines roar. As it draws closer, the station reveals its strange, alien design. It is a massive structure, with jutting spires and strange curved shapes that resemble tentacles. An airlock door slides open, granting the spacecraft access. Inside the airlock, the walls are lit with eerie purple and blue lights, and the air is filled with strange alien smells. The spacecraft slowly turns and docks with the station, eventually settling into place. Once docked, the crew from the spacecraft can leave the safety of their vessel, and explore the mysterious alien space station.",
