  "output": "One easy-to-follow exercise for adults is a simple walking routine. Start by walking for five minutes at a comfortable pace. Increase the duration and intensity of the walk slowly over time. Try taking a few breaks throughout the routine and challenging yourself with hills or varying the route. Additionally, you could incorporate strength training or bodyweight exercises such as squats and lunges into your routine a few days a week.",
