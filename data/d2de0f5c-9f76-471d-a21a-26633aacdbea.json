  "input": "",
  "output": "Three methods for reducing noise levels in a classroom include soundproofing materials, noise-dampening furniture, and the use of sound masking technology. Soundproofing materials like carpeting, insulation, and window treatments can reduce reverberation and the transmission of sound between the walls. Noise-dampening furniture such as acoustic foams and wall panels can be used to absorb sound and limit noise more efficiently. Sound masking technology can be used to further reduce noise levels by creating a background noise that keeps the student's focus on their task at hand.",
