  "input": "",
  "output": "Quantum physics is very complex and counterintuitive, often involving concepts such as wave\u2013particle duality and entanglement that are difficult to visualize and understand. Additionally, because quantum physics operates at the smallest scales of matter and energy, it is difficult to measure and observe with existing technology. This makes it difficult to experimentally verify theories, creating further confusion and difficulty in understanding.",
