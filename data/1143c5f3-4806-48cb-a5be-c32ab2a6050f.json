  "output": "Summer days had always been, for him, a time of joy and relaxation. Every morning he'd wake up with a sense of calmness, almost as if the world had slowed down for him. He would take long leisurely walks by the river, admiring the colors of the sky and the harmony of the birds singing in the trees. By the midday he would rest in the shade of a big tree, and later he'd often take a swim in the cool river that ran near his house. These were the moments that he would cherish, feeling like he was living in a small piece of paradise, a forgotten summer dream.",
