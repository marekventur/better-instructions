  "output": "Coral reefs can be divided into three main habitats: shallow coral reef, mesophotic coral reef, and deep coral reef. The shallow coral reef is the most common type, found in shallow waters near shore. The mesophotic coral reef is found in waters up to 200 meters deep and is also known as the \"twilight zone\". The deep coral reef is found in waters below 200 meters and is characterized by deep canyons, valleys, and walls.",
