  "instruction": "Compare the cost and efficiency of a wind turbine to a solar panel",
  "input": "",
  "output": "In general, wind turbines are more cost-efficient than solar panels. Wind turbines typically have a higher rate of return on investment as they require less investment upfront. Additionally, they can generate power even at night or in cloudy conditions, while solar panels require direct sunlight to be effective. On the other hand, solar panels are typically cheaper to install and less prone to breakage.",
