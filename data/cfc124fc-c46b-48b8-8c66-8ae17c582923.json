  "input": "",
  "output": "Expectation bias is the tendency to process or interpret incoming information in a way that confirms our pre-existing beliefs and expectations. This type of bias can lead to skewed perceptions that simply justify what we already believe. For example, if you hold a negative attitude towards a person, you may be more likely to notice and remember any negative behavior that person displays. Similarly, if you have a positive attitude towards someone, you may be more likely to notice and remember their positive behaviors.  Expectation bias can lead people to make a skewed interpretation of reality and therefore make inaccurate conclusions.",
