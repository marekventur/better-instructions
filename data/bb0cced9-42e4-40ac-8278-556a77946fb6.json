  "instruction": "Construct an argument against a cashless society.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A cashless society can lead to an increase in surveillance and a loss of anonymity due to the use of digital payments that are tracked and stored in large databases. It can also restrict the freedoms that individuals have over their finances, such as the ability to make independent decisions about how and where to spend their money. Furthermore, it could lead to financial exclusion for people without access to digital payments, such as the poor or underbanked. Finally, it could make it easier for governments to implement policies that are difficult for individuals to bypass, such as taxes and surcharges on digital payments.",
