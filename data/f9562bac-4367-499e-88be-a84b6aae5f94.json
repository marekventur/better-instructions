  "input": "",
  "output": "The projected effects of climate change on the farming industry in the next 5 years are expected to be wide-reaching and likely devastating. Temperatures are expected to rise in many parts of the world, leading to an increase in extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. These conditions will likely result in drastic decreases in crop yield, a decrease in livestock production, as well as an increase in soil erosion and contamination. In addition, rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere will lead to increased weed growth and more severe pest infestations. These changes will likely result in a decrease in agricultural productivity, resulting in higher food prices, decreased access to food and malnutrition in many parts of the world. Without significant adaptations and increased innovation, the effects of climate change on the farming industry in the next 5 years will likely be devastating.",
