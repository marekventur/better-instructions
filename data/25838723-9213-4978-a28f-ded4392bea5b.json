  "input": "",
  "output": "Peaches and apples are two popular fruits enjoyed across the world. While they are both similar in that they are both juicy fruits enjoyed raw or processed into other products, they differ widely in appearance, taste, texture, and nutrition. \n\nIn terms of appearance, peaches are round and fuzzy, with a distinct yellow and pink coloring. Apples, on the other hand, vary in shape and size - from elongated to round - and are bright green, red, or yellow in color. In terms of taste, peaches are sweet and slightly tart, while apples are tart and acidic. Additionally, peaches are softer in texture and have a silky, smooth flesh, while apples are crunchy. Furthermore, peaches are higher in vitamin C, while apples are higher in fiber.",
