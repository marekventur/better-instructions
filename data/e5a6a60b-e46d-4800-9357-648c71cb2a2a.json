It turns out that they share the same hometown, and used to play together every day during their childhood.\n\nThey share stories and catch up on their lives. The conversation is so engrossing that the travelers don't even notice when the boarding call for their flights is announced. \n\nEventually, the travelers realize what's happening and bid a tearful goodbye to each other.
