  "output": "A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth. This causes a small area on Earth to experience a few minutes of total darkness as the Moon completely blocks the Sun's bright rays from reaching the Earth's surface. During a total eclipse, the sun's outer atmosphere, called the corona, can be seen. It appears like a white halo or auras around the edges of the Moon.",
