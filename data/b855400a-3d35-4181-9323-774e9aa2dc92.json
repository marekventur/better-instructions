  "input": "",
  "output": "A mountain range is a group of mountains that are close to each other and form a long, continuous landscape. They are typically formed by the same geological forces, such as tectonic plates pushing each other or the pressure of ocean water on the Earth's crust. Mountain ranges come in all shapes and sizes, from isolated peaks to jagged ridges to rolling hills. Some famous mountain ranges include the Rockies, the Himalayas, and the Swiss Alps.",
