  "output": "It is important to manage stress because it can have a significant impact on both physical and mental health. Stress can lead to an increase in blood pressure, disruption of sleep and concentration, digestive problems and even depression. Stress can also lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as binge eating, drinking in excess, smoking, and more. By managing our stress, we can learn to better cope with anxiety and be more productive in our daily life. Stress management techniques can include physical exercise, meditation, yoga, journaling, and more. It is important to establish healthy habits that can help us to better manage our stress in order to achieve desired results.",
