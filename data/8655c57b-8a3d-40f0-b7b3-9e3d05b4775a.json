By practicing environmental sustainability, we can reduce emissions and emissions-causing materials, which can help slow down climate change and its effects. Sustainability also limits the amount of resources that are extracted from the earth, preserving them for future generations. In addition, environmentally sustainable practices promote economic stability and growth, creating a healthier and more equitable society for everyone.",
