  "output": "The evening light shimmers on the shore\nSoftly the waves echoes around and more \nAs I bask in the sun, my worries are all gone\nThe sound of seagulls I now foolishly ignore \nGlistening sand, beckons me with a silent plea \nGlistening seawater, cool to the touch and refreshingly free \nThe evening brings peace, yet I can't find any \nBut maybe in the morning there'll be time for me\nMy bottled peacefulness, I uncork and pour \nThe sound of the ocean, lulls me even more \nAnd for just a moment I close my eyes and behold \nThe vastness of the ocean, to my soul I now unfold.",
