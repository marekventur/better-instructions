  "instruction": "Come up with two ways to solve the following problem.",
  "input": "A town is suffering from severe water shortages.",
  "output": "1. One possible solution is to implement water conservation and waste reduction measures. This can include things like shutting off faucets when not in use, installing efficient appliances, using rain barrels to collect rainwater for gardens, and using landscape materials that conserve water.\n2. Another possible solution is to invest in new water technologies, such as desalination plants, to supply fresh water from non-traditional sources. This could provide a dependable water supply for the town and alleviate the current strain on the existing water resources.",
