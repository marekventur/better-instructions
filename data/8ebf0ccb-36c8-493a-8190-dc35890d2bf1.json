  "instruction": "Generate a user interface for buying tickets to a concert.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "I would create an intuitive, user-friendly interface for buying tickets to a concert. The interface should include fields for users to enter the number of tickets they want to buy, the type of tickets they want to purchase (e.g. seated, standing), and a payment system. It should also include a seating map and an option for adding the ticket to a digital wallet. The interface should be visually appealing and easy to navigate, with clearly labeled buttons to add tickets to the cart and complete the purchase.",
