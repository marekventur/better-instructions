  "output": "The current state of the global economy is one of both strength and uncertainty. While certain industries have seen considerable growth due to advances in technology and globalization, others are still burdened by the effects of the 2008 recession. In the United States, overall economic growth has been steady in recent years, although the unemployment rate remains above historic averages. The stock market has been steadily rising, and consumer confidence and spending remain high. In Europe, the economy remains fragile as Brexit negotiations remain unresolved and the Eurozone continues to struggle with low levels of public debt and unemployment. Despite the lingering uncertainty, the global economy has seen considerable advances in the last decade, providing a positive outlook for the future.",
