  "input": "",
  "output": "Transcription is the process by which genetic instructions in the form of DNA are copied and transferred into a similar molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). The process begins when an enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to a DNA sequence known as a promoter region, which determines where the transcription begins. The RNA polymerase then reads the DNA sequence and uses it as a template to synthesize an mRNA molecule. Finally, the mRNA molecule is modified and moved out of the nucleus, where it is used as a template to produce proteins and enzymes that allow the cell to function.",
