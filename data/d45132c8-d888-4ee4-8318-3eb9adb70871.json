  "instruction": "Describe how voice recognition technology works.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Voice recognition technology uses a combination of software, sensors and microphones to convert speech into text. It works by first capturing a person's voice, then breaking it up into chunks of sounds called phonemes. The individual phonemes are then compared to stored recordings called templates in order to determine what words the person is saying. The technology can also take into account factors such as accent, speed, and tone to create an accurate transcription. Additionally, voice recognition technology is constantly learning and adapting to different environments and dialects.",
