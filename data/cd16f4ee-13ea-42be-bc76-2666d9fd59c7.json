  "output": "Snowflakes drift and wiggle down,\nCovering the ground with white,  \nKids bundle up and race around,\nTo play in a Winter delight.\n\nSoft snowflakes sparkling in the light,  \nMelting when daytime gets warm,  \nIt's fun for children in the night,  \nHaving snowball fights in the snowstorm.\n\nKids hop, glide and do a spin, \nMaking snow angels on the ground,  \nIcy roads are a challenge to win,\nAn adventure that must be found.\n\nWherever you go when the snowflakes fall,  \nBe sure to bundle up well,  \nIt's a magical winter season for all, \nThe best that no one can tell.",
