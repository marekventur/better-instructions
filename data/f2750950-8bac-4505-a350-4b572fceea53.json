  "input": "",
  "output": "There are several differences between ferrets and rats when it comes to keeping them as pets. Ferrets are larger than rats, so they require more space. They are also more active, requiring more exercise and stimulation than rats. Additionally, ferrets are carnivores, so they need to be fed a diet high in protein and fat, while rats can be fed a more diverse diet with grains and vegetables. In terms of their behavior, ferrets are more friendly and cuddly than rats. They are also typically more social and outgoing and tend to respond better to training than rats do.",
