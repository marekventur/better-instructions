  "input": "",
  "output": "Courage and allure the fate of my life,\nAn unknown path set before my sight.\nYet courage leads me onward, to fight\nPast each alluring, dreadful plight.\n\nRisk versus reward -- allure of the right.\nThat which I seek? A search of light.\nWhere courage guides, I must take flight,\nUnraveling the hidden truth of my fate.\n\nAlluring moments of life can be great,\nA chance to learn and discover the brighter things,\nWhere courage and allure will bring\nA sparkle of hope on a path so full of hate.\n\nMy fate awaits me, an abstract fate,\nWhere courage and allure have become my bate.\nRisk is my friend, my ultimate mate,\nTo turn the tide, and rewrite my fate.",
