  "input": "",
  "output": "In networking, a server is a device or program that provides a service to another program or device, called the client. Servers are typically computers that are dedicated to providing these services, while clients are typically devices, such as personal computers, mobile devices, and other computers, that send requests to the server. \n\nThe main difference between a server and a client is the role that each plays. A server is the \"server\" or host of the network, meaning it provides access to data or resources for other computers on the network. The client is the requesting computer, which requests a service or resource from the server. The server then fulfills the request and sends a response back to the client.",
