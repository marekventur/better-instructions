  "output": "The long, dark night loomed over the abandoned island. The waves crashing against the rocks filled the air with an eerie sound. I stepped onto the island, feeling a chill run down my spine. I had heard stories about this place, tales of ghosts and ghouls that still haunt its shores. My heart pounding, I ventured out into the darkness, searching for anyone who may still linger. \n\nI stumbled through the darkness until I saw a faint light coming from the old lighthouse. I cautiously crept up towards it, the creaking of the wooden steps below me sending chills down my spine. I reached the top of the lighthouse and opened the ancient door with a bang. Inside, I discovered an old woman, cowering in the corner. Her voice quivering, she began to tell a tale of a ship that had crashed against the island's rocks. She told me of a pack of cursed sailors that had come ashore in search of revenge.\n\nI quickly ran out of the lighthouse and raced to the beach. I could hear the thunder of hooves and the roar of the cursed sailors. I desperately clung to the rocks, the cold water lapping against my feet. Suddenly, I noticed a glimmer in the night. I reached towards it, and as I did a light illuminated, revealing a small wooden boat. I quickly jumped in, paddling out to sea, never to return to the abandoned island.",
