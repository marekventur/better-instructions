  "output": "I'm standing in front of the waterfall, and the roar of the rushing water is deafening. The riverbed is jagged and rocky, and the sun glints off of them, reflecting a thousand colours. The air is heavy, damp, and clean, and all around me I can see lush, green trees. The waterfall itself is huge, and it cascades over the cliff with a beautiful, misty spray. It's mesmerizing, and I stand here in awe, feeling the mist spray on my face.",
