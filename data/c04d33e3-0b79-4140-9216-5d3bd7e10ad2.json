  "input": "",
  "output": "Solar energy and wind energy are two of the most prevalent forms of renewable energy. Both forms are widely available across the globe, abundant in nature, and not dependent on any other resources. However, they also have some differences. Solar energy is generated through the use of photovoltaic cells that absorb and convert the sun\u2019s radiation, while wind energy is generated by the movement of wind turbines. Solar energy produces lower levels of carbon dioxide than wind energy, but wind energy produces more power for a given area of land. Additionally, wind turbines are noisy and pose a threat to birds, while solar energy production is completely silent.",
