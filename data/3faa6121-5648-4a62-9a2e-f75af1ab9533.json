  "instruction": "Convert this equation 7x^2 + 2x + 7 = 0 into quadratic form.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The equation can be converted into quadratic form by subtracting 7 from both sides, giving us 7x^2 + 2x = -7. Then, divide both sides of the equation by 7, giving us x^2 + 2/7x = -1. Finally, completing the square on the left hand side by adding 1/7 and taking the square root yields (x+1/7)^2 = 6/7. Therefore, the equation can be expressed as (x+1/7)^2 = 6/7.",
