  "input": "",
  "output": "One suggestion for a new driver to build confidence on the road is to practice driving in different environments. Begin by driving in familiar and less trafficked areas and gradually work up to busier places. Additionally, during your initial runs, you can also ask a more experienced driver to ride along with you. This provides an added layer of support, comfort, and guidance. Regular practice and gaining more experience on the road will help you become a more confident driver.",
