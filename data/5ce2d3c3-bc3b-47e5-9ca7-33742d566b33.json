  "output": "If Hazel and Augustus did not meet in \"The Fault in Our Stars\" by John Green, their individual struggles of dealing with cancer would have continued. Hazel would have continued to feel isolated and her condition would have eventually overwhelmed her. Augustus would have grown more and more disillusioned with the world and would have begun to act out. Without Hazel's support and care, it's likely he would have ended up in a darker place.",
