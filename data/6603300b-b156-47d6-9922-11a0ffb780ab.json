  "input": "",
  "output": "The use of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare has had both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, AI has enabled healthcare providers to make more accurate diagnoses, automate clinical processes, and reduce errors in patient records. This can lead to improved operational efficiency, lower costs, and improved patient outcomes. On the negative side, AI can lead to data privacy violations, as it is only as secure as the systems it is running on. Additionally, AI systems can lead to ethical issues, as they are programmed to make decisions based on limited data and may not take human values into account.",
