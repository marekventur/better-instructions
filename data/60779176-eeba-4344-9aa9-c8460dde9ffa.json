The dinner should include a variety of dishes, such as a flavorful soup, roasted vegetables, a delectable main course, and a decadent dessert. While eating, guests can be treated to refreshing cocktails and special wines, and a lively conversation. To top off dinner, a bouquet of flowers can be presented as a token of appreciation.",
