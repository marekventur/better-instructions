  "output": "A hospital data model should contain entities for patients, staff, rooms, appointments, treatments, and medications. Each entity should have attributes to represent the details of the hospital data. For example, a patient entity should have attributes such as name, age, address, and phone number. Additionally, relationships need to be constructed between the entities to represent the data structure. For example, a patient can have a one-to-many relationship with appointments, as a patient can have multiple appointments.",
