  "output": "I strongly disagree with the statement that climate change is a hoax. Multiple scientific studies have shown that climate change is real and caused in part by human activities including burning of fossil fuels. The impacts of climate change can already be seen in the form of rising sea levels, increased extreme weather events, and reduced biodiversity.",
