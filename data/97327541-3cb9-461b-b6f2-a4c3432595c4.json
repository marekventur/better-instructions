  "input": "",
  "output": "The best way to stay organized is to have a plan and set goals that are achievable. Make a list of tasks and prioritize them according to their importance. Also, have a to-do list that you can review each day so that nothing gets forgotten. Make sure to break up big projects into smaller tasks so that it is easier to focus and complete them. Finally, try to create a steady routine and set aside specific times each day for organization. Set reminders for unfinished tasks and reward yourself when you complete them.",
