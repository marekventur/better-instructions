  "output": "One method of solving a Rubik's Cube is the Layer-by-Layer (LBL) method. This method involves solving each layer, starting from the top layer and moving to the bottom layer. The top layer should start with all the corner pieces as well as the edges of the same color. Once the top layer is complete, the middle layer can be solved, followed by the bottom layer. After the bottom layer is complete, the Rubik's Cube should be solved.",
