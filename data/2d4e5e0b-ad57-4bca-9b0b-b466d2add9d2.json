  "instruction": "Summarize a 5-page article about global warming.",
  "input": "The article, \u201cThe Impact of Global Warming on the Environment and Global Economies\u201d, examines the effects of global warming on the environment, animals and humans as well as the economic implications of climate change. It highlights how global warming affects organisms and ecosystems, the increasing cost of expanding resources to mitigate climate change, and rising water levels due to melting polar ice caps. The article also explores the extent to which developing countries must grapple with the need to adapt to global warming and its consequences.",
  "output": "Global warming has the potential to cause massive environmental damage and economic losses for countries around the world. Animals and people are at risk of displacement due to rising temperatures and water levels, ecosystems are vulnerable to warming temperatures and extreme weather conditions, and developing countries will be particularly hard-hit due to their lack of resources and unpreparedness. The article explores the cost of expanding resources to mitigate climate change and the challenges of adapting to global warming. It is clear that the world needs to work together on both solutions and preparations for the negative outcomes of rising temperatures.",
