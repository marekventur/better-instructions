  "input": "",
  "output": "The phrase \"dressed to kill\" originated in 17th century England and was used to describe people wearing their best, most stylish clothes. It later evolved to mean wearing clothing so eye-catching and stylish that it was \"deadly\" in the sense that it could leave people speechless and captivated. In the 20th century, the phrase took on a more literal meaning, as it came to be associated with people wearing clothes that made them appear as if they were ready for combat. In this context, the phrase often refers to suits, leather jackets, and other clothing items. Today, it is used to describe someone who is dressed in an incredibly fashionable and attractive way.",
