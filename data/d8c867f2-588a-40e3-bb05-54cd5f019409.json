  "input": "The flowers fresh and joyous out,\nAre dipped in morning\u2019s dew. \nThe day so fair with clouds around,\nIlluminates my view.",
  "output": "The flowers bright and joyful out,\nTheir petals kissed by morning dew. \nThe sky so fair with clouds around,\nIlluminates a beautiful view. \nTwo ways to improve the poem could be to make the language more poetic by using devices such as alliteration, assonance, or rhyme. Additionally, more powerful descriptive words could be used to create a clearer and more vivid image of the scenery.",
