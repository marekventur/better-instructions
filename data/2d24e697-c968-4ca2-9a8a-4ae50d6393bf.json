  "input": "",
  "output": "Calvinism is a Protestant theological tradition based on the teachings of John Calvin. It emphasizes the supreme authority of Scripture, the sovereignty of God, and the concept of predestination. The main teachings of Calvinism include the doctrine of predestination, the depravity of man, the doctrine of consequence, and the concept of total depravity. Lutheranism is a branch of Protestant Christianity based on the writings of Martin Luther. Lutheranism emphasizes salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, the priesthood of all believers, and the importance of the Bible as a guide for living. Lutheranism places particular emphasis on the necessity of the sacraments for salvation and holds that Scripture is the only source of divine truth. Both Calvinism and Lutheranism emphasize the sole authority of the Bible in matters of faith and practice, though they differ on certain points of doctrine.",
