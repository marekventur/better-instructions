  "input": "",
  "output": "The most effective way to break the habit of procrastination is to create a positive environment by focusing on long-term success rather than short-term pleasure. Focus on the rewards that come with completing assignments and tasks in advance and design an action plan that will help you stay on track while keeping you motivated. Also, break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks and set small deadlines for each of these tasks.",
