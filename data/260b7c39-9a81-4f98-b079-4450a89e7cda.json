  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between an engine used in a car and an engine used in a plane is the type of fuel used. A car engine typically uses gasoline, while a plane engine typically uses jet fuel. Another difference is the size and weight of the engine; a plane engine is far bigger and heavier than a car engine, because it has to generate the power required to lift the plane off the ground. Finally, plane engines produce thrust, whereas car engines only produce torque.",
