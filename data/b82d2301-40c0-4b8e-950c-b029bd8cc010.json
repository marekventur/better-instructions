  "instruction": "Describe the differences between romantic and platonic love.",
  "input": "No Input",
  "output": "Romantic love is an intense feeling of deep affection toward another person, usually sexual. Platonic love on the other hand is an affectionate relationship without the intimate feelings typically seen in a romantic relationship. Romantic love is often focused on a single person, while platonic relationships can involve a group of people. In romantic relationships, there is often a physical component, such as kissing or holding hands. Platonic relationships are often focused more on communication, connection and developing a bond through shared interests and values.",
