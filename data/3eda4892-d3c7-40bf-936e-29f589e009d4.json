  "input": "",
  "output": "The plan for a virtual hangout session should begin by setting a date and time when everyone can meet online. Once the date and time is set, the group should decide on an activity that they can all enjoy together. Popular activities include movie nights, game nights, karaoke, or even just a regular group chat. Before the hangout session, create an invite list and provide any necessary information such as login details, rules of engagement, or game specifications. During the session, make sure to keep an eye on everyone and make sure everyone is active and participating in the conversation. After the session, encourage a bit of follow up conversation so the friendship can be maintained through virtual meetings.",
