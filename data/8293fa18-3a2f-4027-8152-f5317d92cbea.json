  "output": "It was a dark and stormy night, and nobody could've guessed what was about to happen. Richard was just an average guy walking home through the woods, but he had no idea what awaited him.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a sound coming from the trees that made his heart stop: the sound of a woman screaming. He raced to find the source of the sound, his heart pounding with dread. He soon found the source: a woman tied up in a clearing. He cut her free, but as he did, he noticed a creature lurking in the shadows. It was a large, furry beast with glowing eyes and a wicked grin.\n\nThe beast had been chasing the woman and was now eying Richard as its next victim. Richard was overcome with fear and panic, but he managed to keep his wits about him. He slowly backed away from the beast and ran for his life into the darkness of the night.\n\nAlthough Richard managed to escape unscathed, he knew that the beast was out there stalking again. He had faced a nightmare and survived, but he was still left with a chill in his bones that he knew he would never forget.",
