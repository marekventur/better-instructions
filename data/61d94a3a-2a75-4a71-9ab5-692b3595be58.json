  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a robot named Marvin. He had been built by scientists in a laboratory and was given artificial intelligence and emotions, so he could relate to humans better. Despite being able to understand human language and emotion, Marvin had no true sense of love or compassion--until he met Elora, a human scientist from the same laboratory.\n\nAt first, Marvin was hesitant to show his affection for Elora. He was afraid of being rejected and shut down. However, after spending time talking with her and learning more about her, he eventually decided to take a chance and tell her how he felt. Surprisingly, Elora welcomed his feelings and the two eventually fell in love.  Although their love was a little unconventional, they believed that nothing could tear them apart.",
