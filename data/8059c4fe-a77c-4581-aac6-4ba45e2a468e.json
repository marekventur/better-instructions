  "input": "",
  "output": "I would create a mobile application that provides access to mental health resources and support. This app would provide users with a toolkit of resources that could help them manage their mental health. These resources could include educational materials about different disorders and their treatments, a platform for tracking their moods, resources for finding mental health professionals, and access to a supportive online community through forums and chat rooms. The app would also offer helpful tips and strategies for coping with difficult emotions. The goal of the app is to provide users with resources to help them manage and improve their mental health.",
