  "output": "Biodiversity is essential for sustaining a healthy and balanced ecosystem. It helps maintain the natural balance of the environment by providing a diverse number of species that can support each other. It also ensures that organisms have enough food and shelter, as well as natural predators for population control. It also helps maintain genetic diversity, which allows certain species to adapt and evolve better in the face of environmental changes. Biodiversity also helps maintain the quality of air, land, and water, as well as providing ecological benefits such as flood control, nutrient cycling, and soil regeneration.",
