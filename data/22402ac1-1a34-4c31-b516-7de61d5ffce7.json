  "input": "",
  "output": "The ocean floor is comprised of a number of different structures, which divide the ocean into different regions. There are three main areas of the ocean floor - the continental shelf, the continental slope, and the ocean floor. The continental shelf is the edge of the continent and is a shallow sea, usually no deeper than 650 feet. The continental slope is the steep decline that leads to the deep ocean, reaching depths of up to three miles. The ocean floor consists of plains and trenches, with the Mariana Trench being the deepest trench at over 11,000 meters deep. The ocean floor also contains ridges, which are large underwater mountain ranges that span thousands of miles.",
