  "input": "",
  "output": "Two advantages of machine learning over traditional programming are that it can learn and improve from data, and it can process more data faster than traditional programming methods. Machine learning can make more intelligent decisions from data and has been used to improve customer service, image recognition, and data analysis. Additionally, machine learning does not require explicit programming therefore it can be quickly adapted to different kinds of datasets.",
