  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a kind-hearted old woman who loved to care for her garden. She was content in her own little world, until the day a stranger walked into her garden uninvited. She was indignant and tried to shoo him away, but the stranger simply smiled and said he'd been led there by a force greater than himself. \n\nThe old woman was confused but allowed him to stay, as she couldn't bring herself to turn away someone so genuine. As the days passed, he showed her a world she'd never known existed, and she realised that being too trusting can be just as foolish as being untrusting. Eventually she had to let him go, but she was forever changed. She'd come to realise that the stranger hadn't been a menace but an opportunity to open her eyes to a larger world.",
