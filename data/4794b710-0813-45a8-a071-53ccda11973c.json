  "input": "",
  "output": "Sociology and anthropology are closely related fields, as they both examine human behavior within the context of culture and society. Sociology is generally concerned with social patterns, how society influences people, and how people interact within society. Anthropology, on the other hand, is primarily focused on the cultural aspects of a society and how it shapes the lives of individuals within a particular culture. They are both interdependent, as sociology cannot exist without an understanding of anthropology, and vice versa.",
