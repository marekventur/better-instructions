  "output": "One example of sustainable farming is agroforestry, which is the intentional planting of trees or shrubs in a production crop area. This type of farming is beneficial to the environment because it encourages soil conservation, as well as the beneficial interaction of plants. Agroforestry also increases farm biodiversity, which can help reduce the risk of crop yield loss due to pests and diseases.",
