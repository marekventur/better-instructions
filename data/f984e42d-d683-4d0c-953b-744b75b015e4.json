  "output": "Robert Burns' poem \"To a Mouse\" looks at the destabilizing effects of man's actions on the natural world and how it impacts the humble mouse more than anyone else. He sympathetically compares the mouse's response to man\u2019s destruction with his own :protest against an unjust system. He attempts to console the mouse by affirming the presence of good even in a broken world. The poem ends with a tone of understanding and resignation.",
