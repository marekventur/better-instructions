  "output": "Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that are used in classification and regression tasks. They are capable of modeling highly non-linear decision boundaries and can handle large datasets with a wide range of feature sets. On the other hand, they require a large amount of memory and do not perform well with high-dimensional or noisy datasets. They are also sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters, requiring careful tuning to obtain good results.",
