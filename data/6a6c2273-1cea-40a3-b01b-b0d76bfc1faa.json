  "output": "The corresponding child's size for a women's size 6 is typically either a toddler's size 5 or a children's size 6. It is important to keep in mind that children's sizes and toddler's sizes vary greatly from each other and from women's sizes, so it is best to refer to a sizing chart to help determine the exact size for a women's size 6.",
