  "input": "",
  "output": "Building a city using a grid-like system has many benefits. Firstly, it makes it easy for people to navigate around the city. Grid-like city plans are usually symmetrical and uniform, which makes it easier for people to find their way. Secondly, it can help maximize efficiency when constructing the city, as the repetition of similar blocks leads to economies of scale and cost savings. Furthermore, grid-like city plans can be easily expanded as the population grows, as new blocks can be simply added to the existing plan. Finally, grid-like city plans enable efficient usage of current and future resources, as all areas of the city can be easily accessed and developed.",
