  "output": "A simple yet effective app feature that encourages people to recycle could be called the \u201cRecycle Rewards\u201d program. This game-like feature would keep track of how much a user recycles and rewards them with points or virtual currency. These points could then be used to redeem discounts or gifts on things like groceries, clothing, and technology. Additionally, users could compete amongst themselves or be placed in teams to see who recycles the most. Furthermore, they could compare their scores with their friends and neighbors.",
