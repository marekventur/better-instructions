  "output": "Indexing is a way of organizing data in a database so that it can be quickly and easily retrieved. It works by creating an index that can be used to quickly search for the data you want. For example, when you use a search engine like Google, the search engine uses an index that can help quickly find the most relevant websites. Indexing can be used for any type of data, from texts to images to audio files.",
