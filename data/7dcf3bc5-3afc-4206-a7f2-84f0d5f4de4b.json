  "input": "",
  "output": "Computers are faster than humans in solving math problems because of their ability to run arithmetic calculations much faster than humans can. Computers can quickly process billions of operations every second and can be programmed to solve complex problems in a fraction of the time needed by humans. In addition, computers are able to execute instructions more consistently and accurately than humans, resulting in faster and more accurate solutions.",
