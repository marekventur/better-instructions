  "input": "",
  "output": "Living in a big city can provide a person with numerous opportunities and access to resources that may not be available in a smaller town. It can also offer conveniences and amenities that make everyday life easier, such as access to public transportation, better medical facilities, a wider array of cultural activities, and employment opportunities. However, living in a big city can also be costly and stressful, as there will often be more crime, a higher cost of living, and longer working hours due to increased competition.",
