  "input": "Fossil fuels, Global warming",
  "output": "The burning of fossil fuels is one of the main causes of global warming. Fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide when they are burned. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, resulting in rising temperatures and climate change. Therefore, the burning of fossil fuels has a direct link to increasing global temperatures and the resulting climate issues.",
