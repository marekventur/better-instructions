  "input": "",
  "output": "Our research suggests that using electrochemical de-salination technology could reduce the amount of water needed for fracking by 70%. This technology uses electricity to transform sea water into fresh water which could in turn be used during fracking operations. This could significantly reduce the environmental footprint and water consumption of the fracking process.",
