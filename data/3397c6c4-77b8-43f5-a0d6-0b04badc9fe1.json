  "output": "One possible way to use a GPT model to develop an app is to feed it sample data and then provide it with detailed user requirements. The GPT model would then use this data to write code and generate features that would satisfy the user requirements. This model-generated code could then be incorporated into an app, which could be tested and refined by app developers.",
