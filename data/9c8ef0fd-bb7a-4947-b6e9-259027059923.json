  "output": "Once upon a time there were two people, Jack and Margaret, who had diametrically opposing goals. Jack had spent his whole life climbing the corporate ladder, and he was determined to reach the top at any cost. Margaret, meanwhile, was determined to set her own path in life, and she would not be steered away from her dreams. The two of them clashed frequently, and each was ever more determined to get their own way. \n\nHowever, one day their paths happened to cross and a spark of understanding began to grow between them. Jack and Margaret soon discovered that even though their goals were different, they could find common ground and work together towards achieving them. They began to collaborate, and what at first seemed like a situation of opposing motives instead became a beautiful symbiosis.",
