  "instruction": "Create a model for predicting customer churn.",
  "input": "Dataset including customer demographic data, customer activity data and customer churn information.",
  "output": "The predictive model should use a combination of the customer demographic data, customer activity data, and customer churn information provided in the dataset. The model should leverage machine learning and data analysis techniques such as regression and classification models to process the data and identify patterns that can be used to make predictions regarding customer churn. The model should also be able to include more data points over time, such as customer feedback or surveys. Furthermore, the model should provide some level of customization to account for any unique customer characteristics.",
