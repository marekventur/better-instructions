  "input": "",
  "output": "This statement is false. In fact, the strong nuclear force is the strongest force in the universe. It is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of atoms, and its range is limited to nuclear distances. Gravitational force is the weakest force in the universe, but its range is unlimited. It acts between all objects, regardless of their size or the distances separating them.",
