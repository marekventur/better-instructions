  "instruction": "Calculate the kinetic energy of a moving object",
  "input": "Object mass: 10kg, Object velocity: 20 m/s",
  "output": "The kinetic energy of the moving object is 800 Joules (J). This can be calculated using the equation KE=1/2mv2, where m is the object's mass and v is its velocity.",
