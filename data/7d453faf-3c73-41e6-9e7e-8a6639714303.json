  "output": "A web application is typically composed of a user interface, back end application logic, an object-relational mapper, a database, and a web server. The user interface (UI) is the part of the application that the user interacts with, while the backend consists of files, scripts, and data layers that enable functionality. The object-relational mapper provides a way to interact with the database in an object-oriented manner. The web server processes incoming requests from the UI and routes these requests to the appropriate logic, which processes them and returns necessary data. The data is typically persisted in a database.",
