  "input": "Aerobic and anaerobic exercise",
  "output": "Aerobic exercise is any activity that increases your heart and breathing rates and uses oxygen to produce energy. Examples of aerobic exercise include running, cycling, and swimming. Anaerobic exercise is any activity that does not involve using oxygen to produce energy. Examples of anaerobic exercise include weight lifting and sprinting. The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise is that aerobic exercise is sustained for longer periods of time and relies heavily on oxygen for energy production. Anaerobic exercise, on the other hand, is done in short bursts and does not involve the use of oxygen.",
