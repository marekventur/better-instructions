  "output": "Visuals are important for marketing because they help to capture people's attention, communicate messages more quickly and effectively, and create an emotional connection with the audience. Visuals can be used to create an eye-catching design, emphasize key points, explain complex topics, and give life to a brand. They also help to engage viewers and build trust, as people are more likely to remember what they have seen rather than what they have read or heard.",
