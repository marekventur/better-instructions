It can also lead to the dissemination of dangerous ideas or rumors that can cause people to take irresponsible and potentially life-threatening actions. False information can also be used to manipulate public opinion, erode public trust in authoritative bodies, and interfere with democratic processes. It can also lead to physical harm as some people use the internet to plan attacks or incite violence.",
