  "input": "",
  "output": "Once there was a poor person who was looking for a way out of his life of poverty. He searched high and low for the answer, but all he found was despair and hopelessness. One day, he stumbled across a job opening that paid well if he worked hard and smart. He jumped at the opportunity, and soon was able to make enough money to get out of poverty for good. He achieved financial success, but more importantly he felt fulfilled knowing he had done it all on his own. He now passes on his knowledge to others so they can follow in his footsteps and make their dreams come true.",
