The players should take turns picking up an object and describing its characteristics, such as size, color, texture, shape, etc. Once each object is described, the players will lay them out in a circle. The objective of the game is to remember each object in the same order as they were described. Each player takes turns trying to pick up the objects in sequence, and the one to get the highest number without making any mistakes wins.",
