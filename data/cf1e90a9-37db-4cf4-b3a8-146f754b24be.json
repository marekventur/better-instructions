  "output": "Recycling is important to preserve our natural resources, conserve energy, reduce pollution, and reduce the amount of waste that goes into landfills. Recycling helps us save valuable resources such as trees, water, and energy that would otherwise be wasted when making new products from raw materials. It also helps us lessen litter and pollution in our environment. Recycling also reduces the amount of methane gas released into our atmosphere, which helps reduce global warming and climate change. Recycling helps create jobs and boosts the economy, while at the same time helping reduce the need for landfills.",
