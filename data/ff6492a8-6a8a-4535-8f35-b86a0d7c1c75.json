  "output": "To change a tire, start by loosening the lug nuts on the damaged tire by turning them counterclockwise with a lug wrench. Once the lug nuts are removed, lift the car slightly with a jack and then remove the damaged tire. Then, put on the spare tire, put the lug nuts back on, and tighten them in a star pattern with the lug wrench. Finally, lower the car off of the jack, and your tire is successfully changed.",
