  "output": "A chess board is composed of a square board with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight square grid. The board is divided into light and dark squares of alternating colours. Each square is usually identified by a letter and number combination, such as \"A1\" or \"H8\". The chess pieces, including the king, queen, bishops, knights, rooks, and pawns, are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The chess board also includes two sets of pieces, one set for each player, with black pieces on the bottom side of the board and white pieces on the top side.",
