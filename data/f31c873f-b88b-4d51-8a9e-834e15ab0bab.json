  "output": "Robots are becoming increasingly prevalent in India, both in industry and in everyday life. Robot-assisted automation and artificial intelligence are being used in a variety of industries ranging from banking and finance to automotive manufacturing. Private firms, universities, and non-profits are also developing robots with a social purpose. These robots are designed to provide assistance to police, conduct research, and even act as humanoids to provide companionship to those in need. Though it is still early in the development of robots in India, the uses of robots are only expected to increase as technological advancements continue. Additionally, India is taking measures to actively involve artificial intelligence in its development strategy and is providing ample opportunities for technological advancement in the area.",
