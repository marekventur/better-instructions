  "input": "",
  "output": "The colour scheme should be fun and inviting and should preferably include brighter colours that evoke a sense of warmth and happiness. A combination of pink, blue, yellow, and green shades should be used to create a vivid and vibrant palette. Alternatively, warm earthy colours such as orange, brown, red, and purple could be used to create a more subdued and calming palette.",
