  "output": "Jane was trudging through the dense woods, feeling more and more lost as the sun fell lower in the sky. Her throat was raw from shouting for help and her worn hiking boots had blisters on her ankles from the long walk. She was just about to give up and take shelter for the night when she noticed a light in the distance. She stumbled towards it, hoping it was a cabin or some other source of comfort. As she got closer to the light, she realized it was the flickering flame of a bonfire coming from deep within the forest. She crept closer, and as she rounded the bend, she saw a small group of people gathered around the fire. She was relieved to have stumbled across them, and immediately ran to join them as they welcomed her warmly by the fire.",
