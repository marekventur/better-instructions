  "input": "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus",
  "output": "The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that integration and differentiation of a function are inverse processes. This theorem is important because it relates the two most common operations in calculus and provides a powerful tool to find the values of indefinite integrals that may be difficult to compute otherwise. Moreover, the theorem enables the calculation of area below a curve which is a crucial concept in mathematics, physics, and economics.",
