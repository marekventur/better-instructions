  "output": "Seth woke up early in the morning and decided to take a stroll on the beach. He walked along the shoreline as the sun began to rise, feeling the cool ocean breeze on his skin. As he walked further, he realized that he was alone on the beach, which made him feel calm and contented. He listened to the sound of the waves crashing against the shore and watched the seagulls soaring above. He knew that he was having a special moment that he would never forget.",
