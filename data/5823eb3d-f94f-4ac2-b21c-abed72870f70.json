  "output": "The Covid-19 pandemic has caused profound changes across the world in many areas including health, society, economy, education and culture. In terms of health, it has resulted in an unprecedented loss of life, with over 3 million people having died. It has affected socio-economic life and in particular, exacerbated and deepened existing inequalities throughout the world. In terms of education, it has forced the closure of educational institutions and affected the ability of children to learn. In the field of culture, it has changed the way people communicate with each other, forcing them to rely heavily on technology and digital platforms for almost all aspects of life. In short, the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to have long-lasting impacts and can potentially permanently change the way the world works in many aspects.",
