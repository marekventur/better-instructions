  "input": "",
  "output": "Bottom-up processing in psychology refers to the use of sensory information to reach a conclusion. It involves the use of concrete facts and data, rather than abstract considerations, to draw conclusions. In bottom-up processing, the individual starts with the most basic information and gradually works their way up to the conclusion. This type of processing is important for understanding the world around us and making decisions. It is also helpful for reasoning and problem-solving because it allows us to think in a more systematic and analytical way.",
