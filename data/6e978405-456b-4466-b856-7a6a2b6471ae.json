  "output": "The goal of the machine learning model is to recommend movies to users based on a variety of factors. These factors can include movie ratings, genre preferences, user reviews, and other available data. The model will learn from existing data to determine which movies are most likely to be preferred by a particular user. It can then rank them and make personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences.",
