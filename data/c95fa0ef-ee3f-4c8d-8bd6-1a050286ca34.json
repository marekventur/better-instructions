  "instruction": "Summarize the following essay, with the main points",
  "input": "All creatures on Earth suffer. Pain is an unavoidable part of life, no matter what form or species. Whether it\u2019s a human\u2019s judgmental scowl or the lion\u2019s injured paw, suffering can be found in the most unlikely places. But why must this be? \n\nSome deny this reality, instead claiming that the whole universe is a random accident. But nature\u2019s grand design points towards a Supreme Being. This is evident in the intricate details of every ecosystem and how every organism is designed for its role.",
  "output": "Suffering is a part of existence for all creatures on earth, regardless of species, form, or life. People deny this being a reality but nature's grand design and intricate details point towards a higher power. This reinforces the notion that there is a supreme being that coordinates and organizes the earth and its creatures.",
