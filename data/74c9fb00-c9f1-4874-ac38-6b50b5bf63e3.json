  "input": "",
  "output": "Home gardeners should be aware that tomatoes need a lot of sun and warmth to grow, so they should find a spot in the garden that gets at least 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Tomatoes are susceptible to various diseases and pests, so gardeners should pay attention to their plants for signs of trouble and take measures to reduce the chances of their tomato plants getting sick. They should also rotate their crops and avoid planting tomatoes in the same spot year after year. Additionally, tomatoes should be kept well watered throughout the growing season and given enough fertilizer so that they can produce fruits. Finally, tomatoes should be harvested when they are ripe to ensure the best flavor.",
