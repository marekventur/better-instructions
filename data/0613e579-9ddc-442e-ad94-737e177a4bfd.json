  "input": "",
  "output": "The Iterative Development approach is a cyclic software development process where each iteration builds upon the results of previous iterations. It emphasizes the importance of constant feedback and evaluation, where requirements, design, and the development process are all subject to regularly review and improvement. The goal of Iterative Development is to give users the ability to evaluate each iteration before proceeding to the next development stage, thus enabling them to make adjustments at any point within the development process as new information and insights are gained.",
