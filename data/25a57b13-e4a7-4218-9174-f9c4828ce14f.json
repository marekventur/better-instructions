  "output": "This code snippet implements the quick sort algorithm to sort an array of elements. It works by selecting a pivot element from the array, and then splitting the array into two sub-arrays. The elements in the sub-arrays are compared to the pivot, and then arranged in order from lower to higher value. This process is repeated recursively until the array is sorted.",
