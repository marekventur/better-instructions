  "output": "Once upon a time there were two best friends, Jack and Jill. Jack was brave and strong, while Jill was clever and kind. They were always there for each other, no matter what. One summer, they went on a grand adventure together. They hiked through the woods, swam in the river, and even tested their courage by going camping in the dark. They shared it all and made memories to last a lifetime. They were inseparable, just like true best friends should be.",
