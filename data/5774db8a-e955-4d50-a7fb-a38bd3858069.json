  "input": "",
  "output": "My innovative idea for a new product is a smart fabric that can be used to create clothing and home furnishings. This fabric would be embedded with electronics and sensors which would allow wearers or occupants to adjust temperature, sound, or light levels. The fabric would be able to detect motion, body temperature, and light levels to provide a customized experience to the user. Additionally, this fabric could be easily integrated into existing clothing and home furnishing designs, allowing for greater creativity and customization.",
