  "input": "",
  "output": "The difference between a k-mer and an N-gram is that a k-mer is a sequence of k items, while an N-gram is a sequence of N items. A k-mer typically consists of a set of words, while an N-gram typically consists of a set of words or other pieces of text. Additionally, the context of a k-mer is typically limited to the immediate words that precede or follow it, while an N-gram typically takes into account more context in terms of the words that appear before or after it.",
