  "input": "A small boat drifted in the lake, with nobody at the oars.",
  "output": "The small boat drifted aimlessly in the lake, as if it was guided by some unknown force. It had been drifting for what felt like hours, yet the boat seemed to be no closer to any shore. Suddenly, a figure began to stir, and a strange being in the form of a human emerged from within the boat. The figure had no face and moved silently, seeming to be looking for something. The boat kept drifting, and soon an island came into view. The figure stood up and pointed towards it with an unnatural certainty. The boat then began to move with purpose, as if it were drawn towards some mysterious destination.",
