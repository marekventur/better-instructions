  "input": "",
  "output": "Computer vision algorithms are used to detect and recognize human faces. A computer system looks for patterns in the pixels of an image or video, comparing them to a database of known faces. If a match is found, the computer can accurately identify the face. The most common computer vision algorithms used for facial recognition are deep learning models. These models employ a set of convolutional neural networks to analyze pixel patterns, facial features, and even head position. Once a face is detected, the computer system will then extract features that are unique to that person, such as the shape and size of the facial features, and use them to match the face with the corresponding person in its database.",
