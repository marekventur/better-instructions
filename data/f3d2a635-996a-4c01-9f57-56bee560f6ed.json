  "output": "The endangered African elephant is in danger due to poaching, habitat loss, and climate change. Poaching is mainly driven by demand for ivory in the illegal wildlife trade. Additionally, the destruction of their natural habitats is a major factor as well. Also, rising temperatures associated with climate change, along with increased drought and extreme events, also poses a threat to the African elephant.",
