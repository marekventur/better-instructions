  "instruction": "Given an emotion, come up with a creative way to show it with body language.",
  "input": "Happiness",
  "output": "Expressing happiness through body language could involve joyous facial expressions such as a wide, toothy grin; relaxed body posture with arms slightly outstretched; and enthusiastic gestures such as jumping up, arms twirling, and exaggerated movements. Another way to show happiness is through mimicking the body language of a happy person. This could include things like a relaxed exhale, a slight head tilt, and a smile.",
