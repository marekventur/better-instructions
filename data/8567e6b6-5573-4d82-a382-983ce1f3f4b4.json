  "input": "",
  "output": "Plutonium's melting point is around 1122 degrees Celsius. It is one of the few elements that has a boiling point lower than its melting point, with a boiling point of about 913 degrees Celsius. It is highly heat-resistant, so it can handle temperatures up to 913 degrees Celsius without any problem but begins to melt at 1122 degrees Celsius.",
