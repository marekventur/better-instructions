  "output": "An example of an algorithm is Quicksort. Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that uses a form of divide and conquer to quickly sort an array of data. It works by Divide by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot element. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.",
