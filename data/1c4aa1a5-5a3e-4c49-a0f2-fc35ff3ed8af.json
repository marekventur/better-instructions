  "input": "",
  "output": "The campaign process for an election can be likened to a marathon race. Candidates must prepare hard in order to succeed, researching their opponents and trying to understand the electorate. They must stay focused and put in the hard work that is required to win, just as one does for a marathon. The actual election then becomes the culmination of the race, with candidates trying to reach the finish line first.",
