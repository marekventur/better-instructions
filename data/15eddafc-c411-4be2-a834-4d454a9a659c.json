  "output": "A practical use of a GPT model is text generation. For example, a GPT model can be used to generate product descriptions, customer service scripts, or article summaries automatically. By providing the model with a seed text to begin with and letting it predict the next words in the sequence, it can generate long paragraphs of meaningful text with a high degree of accuracy. This process can be used to help businesses generate large amounts of content quickly and accurately, making it a time-saving tool.",
