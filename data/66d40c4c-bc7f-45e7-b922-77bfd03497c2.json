  "input": "",
  "output": "A quality level system can be created with a set of criteria to rate products according to different categories. For example, every product can be rated on a scale of one to five with one being the lowest level of quality and five being the highest. The scale can be broken down further with specific criteria such as: \n- Materials used (1 being low-grade materials, 5 being high-grade materials)\n- Durability (1 being low durability, 5 being high durability)\n- Price range (1 being low-priced, 5 being high-priced)\n- Performance (1 being low performance, 5 being high performance)\n \nUsing such a system would make it possible to determine the overall quality of a product based on criteria such as materials, durability, price range, and performance.",
