  "input": "",
  "output": "A GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) model is a type of natural language processing (NLP) model that has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text. The model uses a transformer architecture that helps it capture the context of the words in a sentence. This allows the model to generate natural-sounding sentences based on an input prompt. The GPT model is able to predict the next word in a sentence given previously seen words in the sentence, and can be further fine-tuned to generate more diverse and personalized outputs.",
