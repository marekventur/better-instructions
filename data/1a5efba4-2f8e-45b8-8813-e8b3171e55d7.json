  "input": "",
  "output": "The implications of a highly automated economy are far-reaching, from job displacement to inequality in access to resources and wealth. Automation will likely lead to fewer jobs, and will likely disproportionately affect lower-income workers with less access to technology and training to keep up with these changes. Automation could also lead to increased wealth inequality, as those with access to the technology and resources to automate will be able to accrue large profits, while workers required to operate the machines have less bargaining power to negotiate better wages and conditions. Finally, automation may lead to higher prices for goods and services, due to reduced competition and economies of scale.",
