  "input": "",
  "output": "My worst experience at a restaurant was when I went out for dinner with some friends and was terribly disrespected by the server. He was rude and dismissive when taking our order and made us feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. When he brought out our food, we noticed that one of the orders was wrong so we asked him to fix it. He refused to acknowledge that it was his mistake and instead blamed us for ordering it incorrectly. We asked to speak to the manager, but he became belligerent and told us to leave. We ended up leaving without eating and have never returned to that restaurant. It was an extremely upsetting and demeaning experience that left a negative impression of the restaurant and its service.",
