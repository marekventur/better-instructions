  "instruction": "Describe how fire spreads in a forest.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Fire spreads through a forest by a combination of several factors, including wind direction and speed, humidity levels, and fuel availability. Fire travels through trees and other vegetation, with the surrounding air acting as a conduit which carries the heat and embers forward. The flames can jump over gaps in the terrain and the vegetation, lighting new fires far ahead of the main source. This allows the fire to quickly spread over large areas.",
