  "input": "Friendship",
  "output": "Friendship is one of life's most cherished gifts. It is the bond between two people formed out of unconditional love and understanding, no matter the distance or time apart. True friends can make a rainy day seem brighter with their optimism and their ability to make the best out of any situation. They support each other through thick and thin, never abandoning each other. Good friends will never deliberately hurt each other and will always come to the aid of one another. Friends are people who we can trust and depend on, who always have our back. Friendship takes dedication and patience, but with the right attitude it can become a lifelong bond that brings people together forever.",
