  "output": "Biodiversity and climate change are closely linked. A change in the climate can cause changes in the ecosystems and habitats which can impact biodiversity. The loss of biodiversity, which includes the loss of animal and plant species, can result in a decrease in the ability of ecosystems to adapt to changes in the climate. In addition, a decrease in biodiversity can reduce the availability of resources and services, such as pollination and nutrient cycling, that are essential for human life.",
