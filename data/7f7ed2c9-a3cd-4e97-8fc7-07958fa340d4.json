  "input": "",
  "output": "There are several steps you can take to keep yourself safe while walking in the dark. First, be aware of your surroundings and stay in well-lit, populated areas. Avoid taking shortcuts when possible and keep away from alleyways and dark alcoves. Wear bright clothing and reflective tape to make yourself more visible to passing cars. If you have a cell phone, make sure it is charged and ready to make a call if necessary. Carry any valuables in a secure bag or pocket to prevent theft. Finally, trust your instincts and if you see something or someone suspicious, remove yourself from the situation immediately.",
