  "instruction": "Design a new password authentication system.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "I propose a new password authentication system that incorporates both password and biometric based authentication. To use the system, the user will be required to enter their username and password, as well as provide evidence of their identity through biometric authentication such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning. This system will be highly secure and can also be used for applications that require a high level of security, such as banking and financial institutions.",
