It refers to a shift in global climate patterns, resulting in more extreme weather, rising temperatures, and greater variability in how and where events like rain, floods, and droughts occur. It is widely accepted by scientific and civic communities that climate change is being caused by human activity, and that the effects of it will be felt around the world.
