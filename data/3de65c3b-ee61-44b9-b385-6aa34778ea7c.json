  "input": "",
  "output": "A musical instrument can be made using everyday objects such as empty plastic bottles, rubber bands, and a wooden stick. To create the instrument, the bottles should be filled with varying amounts of water to create different sound frequencies. In addition, a rubber band should be tied around each bottle for a surface to pluck. Finally, the wooden stick should be used to strike the bottles like a drumstick. When all these components are combined, it creates an interesting musical instrument with unique sound qualities.",
