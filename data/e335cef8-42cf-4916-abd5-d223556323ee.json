But it became blocked by a great boulder too large for the river to move. But then one day, the river noticed a tiny chipmunk. The chipmunk showed the river a secret path she could take to curve around the boulder, providing the lands with plentiful water. The river was overwhelmed with new knowledge and took that path, triumphantly flowing around the boulder and achieving her wish.",
