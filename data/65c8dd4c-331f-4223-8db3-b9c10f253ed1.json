  "output": "Nature is essential to our lives in countless ways, yet it has been forgotten, abused and neglected. Nature conservation is important not only because it helps foster biodiversity, but it also helps us to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Conservation can protect ecosystems from becoming weakened and vulnerable to climate change, prevent extinction of threatened species, and ensure clean air, water, and food for all. Conservation also has economic benefits, as tourism and revenue from nature-based activities can contribute to local and national economies. Therefore, we must take responsibility to create awareness and conserve nature in order to make our planet a cleaner, safe and more sustainable place for generations to come.",
