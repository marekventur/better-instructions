  "input": "Building a web app",
  "output": "My plan for building a web app is to first research the best tools and frameworks for the job. I will also look into free and paid resources that I can use. Next, I'll create a wireframe of the app. I'll then move on to defining the core functions and features that I want the app to have. I'll create a basic flow for the user interface and work on the design. After I have a clear idea of what I want, I'll start the actual coding and set up the backend and database. Finally, I'll launch the app and start marketing it.",
