  "instruction": "Create a list of ten potential causes of global warming.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Burning of Fossil Fuels \u2013 Burning coal, oil, and other fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, which is a major contributor to global warming.\n2. Deforestation \u2013 Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen, so cutting down trees reduces their ability to reduce CO2 emissions.\n3. Industrial Agriculture \u2013 The use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and other synthetic compounds in industrial agriculture contributes to emissions of greenhouse gases.\n4. Methane Release \u2013 Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and is released into the atmosphere through various processes such as cattle farming and landfills.\n5. Landfills \u2013 Landfills release methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.\n6. Aircraft Emissions \u2013 Aircraft produce large amounts of carbon dioxide and other emissions, which contribute to global warming.\n7. Natural Gas Flaring \u2013 Large amounts of natural gas are burned off in the production of oil, releasing more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n8. Degradation of Oceans \u2013 Over-fishing, coral reef destruction, and other actions are contributing to the destruction of the oceans which are a major component in the Earth\u2019s climate control.\n9. Methane Clathrates \u2013 Methane Clathrates, or frozen methane deposits, are being released into the atmosphere due to changes in ocean temperatures.\n10. Terrestrial Albedo \u2013 Natural events like fires, droughts, and deforestation reduce the amount of sunlight reflected off the Earth\u2019s surface, which can contribute to global warming.",
