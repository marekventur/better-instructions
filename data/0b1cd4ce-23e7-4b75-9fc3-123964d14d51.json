  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce plastic waste in everyday life is to make the switch to reusable items. This includes bringing a reusable water bottle instead of buying bottled water, investing in a reusable coffee cup, bringing your own bags when shopping, and using reusable containers for storing and transporting food. You can also reduce the amount of plastic waste you create by avoiding or limiting the use of take-out or single-use containers, utensils and straws. Additionally, try to find sustainable alternatives to plastic items when shopping and avoid purchasing items wrapped in plastic whenever possible. Finally, make sure you recycle any plastic items you do have.",
