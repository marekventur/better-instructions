  "input": "",
  "output": "Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic strategy in which a complex problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Then these sub-problems are each solved to create a solution to the larger problem. This is often done recursively, meaning that each sub-problem is broken down further until it can be solved. After a solution is found for each of these smaller problems, the solutions are combined to find the solution to the original problem.",
