  "input": "",
  "output": "Software engineers must use version control systems to track changes to the codebase, ensure that changes do not conflict, and ensure that all changes are accounted for. Version control systems allow engineers to maintain a clear history of changes and roll back to a prior version if necessary. Additionally, version control systems also allow multiple engineers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without issues.",
