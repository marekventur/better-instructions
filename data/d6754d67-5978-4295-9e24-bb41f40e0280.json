  "input": "",
  "output": "The logo for the new app should reflect resilience, hard work, and creativity. It should have a strong, yet simple design, incorporating natural elements such as a tree or mountain as a symbol of strength and determination. The colors used should also encompass the idea of resilience, such as cool blues, greens, and purples. Incorporating a symbol of creativity, such as a brush or paint palette can be included as well. All together, the logo should embody the core values of resilience, hard work, and creativity, while standing out and being memorable.",
