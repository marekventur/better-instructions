  "input": "",
  "output": "1. A basketball is more spherical and less aerodynamic, whereas a soccer ball is more oval and aerodynamic.\n2. A basketball is much bigger in size than a soccer ball, with a diameter of 29.5 to 30 inches.\n3. The design of a soccer ball has 32 panels and black hexagons (pentagons) on it. The basketball usually has 8 parallel panels in the form of half-octagons.\n4. The material of a basketball is usually leather or composite material made of synthetic rubber, while the surface of a soccer ball is normally stitched leather.\n5. The inflation of a basketball is also higher than that of a soccer ball, which typically ranges from 8.5 to 15.5 psi. The pressure of a soccer ball is usually 6.5 to 15 psi.",
