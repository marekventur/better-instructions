  "output": "An exciting feature for a mobile application that can increase user engagement is a loyalty program. This would reward users for performing activities such as inviting friends to join the app, making purchases, or accomplishing specific levels within the app. Rewards could come in the form of discounts, free items, or other incentives. An easy-to-use interface for tracking progress towards rewards could also diminish drop-off in user engagement.",
