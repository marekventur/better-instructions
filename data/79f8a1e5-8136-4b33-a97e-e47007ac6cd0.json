  "output": "The Genetic Code is the set of rules used by living things to turn the genetic information stored in DNA and RNA into proteins. It consists of a sequence of three-letter combinations called codons. Each codon represents one of 20 different amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. All the information needed to make an organism is encoded in the codons of its DNA and RNA molecules.",
