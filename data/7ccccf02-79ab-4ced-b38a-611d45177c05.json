  "input": "",
  "output": "In a world where everyone was honest, there would be no secrets. People would feel safe to express their true thoughts and feelings, knowing that their secrets would not be used against them. Relationships would be built on trust and understanding, and everyone would be accountable for their words and actions. Conflict would often be resolved quickly and fairly, as people would not be able to take advantage of one another. Decisions would be made for the collective good and there would be greater freedom and prosperity for all.",
