  "output": "Mitosis and meiosis are two distinct forms of cell division that serve different purposes in the body. Mitosis is a type of asexual reproduction in which a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells. It is primarily used for growth, repair, and maintenance of multi-cellular organisms by providing cells for growth, wound healing, and replacing old or damaged cells. Meiosis, on the other hand, is a type of sexual reproduction that involves two rounds of cell division to produce four haploid daughter cells. It is used in the production of gametes, or sex cells, by providing genetic diversity. The primary difference between mitosis and meiosis is that mitosis produces two daughter cells with the same genetic content, whereas meiosis produces four daughter cells with half the genetic content of the parent cell.",
