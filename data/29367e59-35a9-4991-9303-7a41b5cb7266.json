  "input": "",
  "output": "An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that allows developers to work with relational databases using an object-oriented programming language. ORMs provide an easy-to-use layer of abstraction when developing database-driven applications, allowing developers to more easily query and manipulate data from a database. ORMs also eliminate the need for many lines of repetitive SQL code and help to maintain a consistent API for interacting with a database, no matter the underlying database type.",
