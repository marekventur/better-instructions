  "input": "",
  "output": "A linear equation is a mathematical equation where all terms are linear, meaning that any terms that have a variable or exponent must have the same power or exponent. A nonlinear equation is an equation that is not linear and involves terms with variables and exponents that may have different power or exponents. In linear equations, the solution is always a single point, while in nonlinear equations, the solutions may be multiple points or a curve.",
