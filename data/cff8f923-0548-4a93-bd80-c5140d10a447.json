  "input": "",
  "output": "Net carbon emissions refer to the total amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. This number is determined by taking into account the emissions released by human activities, as well as the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed back into the atmosphere by natural processes, like photosynthesis. A net zero carbon emissions target would mean that the same amount of emissions is absorbed as released.",
