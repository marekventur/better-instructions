  "output": "Language models generate text sequences that exhibit similar properties to natural language, while classifiers categorize a given sequence into one of several predefined classes. Language models are used to generate cohesive and intelligible text sequences, while classifiers are used to make predictions about a given sequence based on its similarity to previous sequences seen by the model.",
