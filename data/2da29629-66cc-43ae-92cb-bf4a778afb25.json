  "input": "",
  "output": "The process of extracting insights from data involves a number of steps. First, data must be collected and cleaned. This involves identifying the source of the data and ensuring that it is in a format suitable for analysis. Once the data is in the proper format, it must be organized and structured. Then, the data can be analyzed using techniques such as descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. This can provide insights into patterns, trends, correlations, and other interesting phenomena in the data. Finally, the insights can be communicated to stakeholders through informative visuals, reports, or other methods.",
