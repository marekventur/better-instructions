  "input": "",
  "output": "A financial budget plan for a person who makes $50,000 a year should include saving at least 10% of their monthly income, contributing to a retirement fund, paying bills on time, tracking expenses, paying down their debt, and having an emergency fund. For example, for the month of January, the person could save $500, contribute $200 to their retirement fund, and set aside $1000 for any unexpected spending. The remaining budget could then be allocated towards rent, utilities, medical expenses, insurance payments, and food.",
