  "input": "",
  "output": "Playing outdoor sports have numerous physical and mental health benefits compared to playing indoor sports. Outdoor sports require more physical activity and use of the environment, while indoor sports are usually more structured and may require less physical movement. Outdoor sports also often involve more direct contact with the elements, such as sun, wind, and rain, which has a number of health benefits, while indoor sports may be more protected from the elements. Outdoor sports also generally involve different elements, such as a court, field, or track, compared to indoor sports which usually take place in one court or field. Finally, outdoor sports usually allow for more team interaction and faster reflexes while playing, while indoor sports are often more strategic and methodical in nature.",
