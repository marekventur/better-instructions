This includes sections like qualifications, experience, education, certifications, and other relevant experiences. Make sure to use clear, descriptive titles and to incorporate appropriate keywords. Additionally, it is important to provide contact information at the end of the CV, as well as list any additional relevant documents such as letters of recommendation or a portfolio.",
