  "input": "",
  "output": "The current global economic crisis can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, a global oversupply of oil, plummeting energy prices, plunging stock markets, a surge in unemployment, and the slowdown in global economic activity. The pandemic has caused a dramatic collapse in international trade and has prompted governments to impose various restrictive measures to protect public health, further exacerbating the economic conditions. The expansive deficits of many countries have also worsened the situation, creating a cycle of debt and unemployment which has had a significant negative impact on the global economy.",
