  "input": "",
  "output": "Scientists' predictions of the future often go wrong because they are based on limited data and incomplete models. Factors like unexpected events, changes in technology, or even randomness can drastically alter the likelihood of an event occurring. Additionally, predictions are often based on the extrapolation of current trends, which can be inaccurate if other trends come into play. As such, the ability for scientists to accurately follow and anticipate the evolution of complex systems is limited, resulting in a higher likelihood of incorrect predictions.",
