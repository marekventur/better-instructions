  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to investigate the cause of air pollution is to conduct air quality monitoring, where pollutants in the atmosphere are detected and measured. This can involve sampling the air for specific pollutant concentrations and tracking these changes over time. Pollutant concentrations can be compared to legal standards to determine whether or not the air quality meets requirements set by the government. In addition, wind patterns and weather conditions can be studied to better understand how air pollution develops and disperses throughout an area over time.",
