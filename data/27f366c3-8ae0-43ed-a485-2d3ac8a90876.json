  "input": "",
  "output": "Once upon a time, there was an elephant who lived in the jungle. He was content with his life and loved his home. Being the biggest animal in the area, he was well respected by the other animals. He was kind and generous, sharing his food and giving shelter to those in need. One day, he was visited by a young orphaned monkey. The monkey was in dire need of help and the elephant understood her plight. He took the monkey under his wing and soon she became part of the family. He cared for her just like his own child and she never felt alone again. The moral of this story is that even though we might seem different from one another, we can all come together and support each other like a family.",
