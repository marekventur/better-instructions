  "output": "Cellular respiration is a process by which the body breaks down glucose into energy for the cells to use. It has three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. During glycolysis, glucose is converted into pyruvate. In the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is broken down into carbon dioxide, water, and chemical energy. During oxidative phosphorylation, the energy released in the Krebs cycle is used to make ATP molecules.",
