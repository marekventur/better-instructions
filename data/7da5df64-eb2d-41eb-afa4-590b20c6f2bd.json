  "input": "The customer called in to ask a question about a product they recently purchased. The customer service person had limited product knowledge and was unable to properly answer the customer\u2019s question.",
  "output": "A customer service representative with limited product knowledge should not be responsible for answering customer questions about their purchased products. The company can provide further training for customer service representatives, or have product specialists who have more detailed knowledge about their products to be available to answer customer queries. Alternatively, the company can also develop self-service options, such as providing FAQs on their website and customer portals, so customers can look for answers to their questions without needing to contact customer service.",
