  "output": "Deep Learning is a form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on using algorithms to identify patterns and relationships in data. It uses various Artificial Neural Network (ANN) structures such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks to \"learn\" data. The input is typically unstructured data such as images or text, while the output can range from simple results such as a text classification or a predictive model to more complex output such as generating natural language descriptions. Deep Learning has had an enormous impact in a wide range of fields, from computer vision to speech recognition to natural language processing. It has also been applied to other areas, including robotics and healthcare. The success of deep learning has enabled breakthroughs and new capabilities in self-driving cars, facial recognition, medical image processing, game playing and more.",
