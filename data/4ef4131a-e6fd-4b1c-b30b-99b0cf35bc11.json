  "instruction": "Develop a classification algorithm to identify the type of plant from its description.",
  "input": "The plant has broad green leaves with white flowers.",
  "output": "A potential classification algorithm could use pattern recognition techniques such as machine learning to identify the type of plant. This would involve collecting datasets of features and descriptions of different plants and using these to train an algorithm to detect the type of plant from the given description.",
