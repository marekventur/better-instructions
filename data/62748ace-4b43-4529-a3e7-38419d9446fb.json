  "input": "",
  "output": "Leadership and management are both essential for an organization to operate effectively. Leadership focuses on setting an overall direction for an organization, and inspiring and motivating others to follow that direction. Management, on the other hand, is more focused on getting tasks done, and includes activities such as planning, organizing, and controlling. Leadership involves setting a vision, while management involves ensuring that the vision is achieved through conscientious effort. Leaders provide the proverbial \u201cbig picture\u201d, while managers focus on the details. Both leadership and management are needed to successfully operate any organization.",
