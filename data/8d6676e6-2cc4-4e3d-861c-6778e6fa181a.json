  "output": "GIGO stands for 'Garbage In, Garbage Out', and it is a concept that is often used in computing. It refers to the idea that if data is inputted incorrectly, or if the data that is inputted is of poor quality, then the output from the process, or results of the process will also be of poor quality. This concept applies to all kinds of computing, from programming to data analysis. It emphasizes the importance of making sure the data that is inputted is accurate, so that the results of the process are also accurate.",
