  "input": "",
  "output": "The most likely outcome of the upcoming climate change conference is that world leaders will agree to some type of binding contract or agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This agreement will likely involve setting targets for countries to reduce emissions, establishing mechanisms for monitoring and verifying progress, and setting up a system of penalties and rewards for countries that do and don't meet their targets. In addition, the agreement is likely to include provisions for providing developing countries with access to clean energy and financial aid to help them transition to renewables.",
