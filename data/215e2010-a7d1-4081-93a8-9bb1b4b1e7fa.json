  "output": "A neutral color scheme, such as whites and grays, is a great choice for a living room. If you want to add a dash of color or create a more bold look, you can choose an accent color such as navy, deep purple, or hunter green. You can also play with different shades of neutrals and accent colors for a softer look or use light and bright colors for a more vibrant atmosphere.",
