  "output": "Safety protocols for handling hazardous materials include wearing protective gear such as gloves, goggles, and face masks; ensuring good ventilation in the working area; removing all combustible materials; labeling containers properly; being aware of any potential reactions between different materials; and always following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Additionally, personnel must be trained on the proper handling of materials, know the location of safety equipment, and be aware of the potential hazards in case of accidental contact, spillage, or inhalation. All personnel must also use ventilators with an assigned protection factor of at least 10. Finally, always maintain good housekeeping practices, and periodically inspect and test safety equipment for proper functioning.",
