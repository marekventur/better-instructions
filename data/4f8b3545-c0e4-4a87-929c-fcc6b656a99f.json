  "input": "",
  "output": "Dynamic programming is an algorithm design technique used for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler sub-problems. This technique uses incremental solutions to help compute the optimal solution to the problem and can be applied to problems such as optimization, game theory, and resource allocation.",
