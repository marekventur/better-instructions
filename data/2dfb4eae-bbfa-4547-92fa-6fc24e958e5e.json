  "output": "Rivers are like long winding roads that lead us down new paths.\nThey are like a lifeline, they protect us in their wakes. \nThey carve paths deep in the ground and carry the secrets we don\u2019t share. \nLike a rainbow, they stretch out over each land; showing that beauty can be found anywhere.\n\nRivers provide lifeblood to all living things, including us. \nIn nature they are bright and full of energy; in cities they become industrial, with factory built on each side. \nBut one thing is certain, rivers keep flowing, even if the current changes in every way. \nLike a journey, life will always bring us new experiences and rivers show us that it's alright.",
