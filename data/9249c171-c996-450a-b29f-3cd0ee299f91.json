  "input": "",
  "output": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more particles remain connected, regardless of distance, so that the actions of one affect the others. It allows for communication and correlation between particles that we would not expect under classical physics, and it forms the basis for many quantum computing applications like teleportation, superposition, and quantum cryptography.",
