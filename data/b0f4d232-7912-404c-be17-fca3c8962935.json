  "instruction": "Describe how the butterfly effect works.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The butterfly effect is the idea that small changes in one system can generate large differences in the behavior of another system. It is based off the concept that a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world can cause a hurricane in another part of the world. The idea is that small changes in one place can result in seemingly unrelated changes in other places. This phenomenon is often used to explain the unpredictability and complexity of weather systems, but can also be applied to other complex systems, such as economics and politics.",
