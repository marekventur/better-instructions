  "instruction": "Describe a modern issue or challenge facing US cities.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One major issue facing US cities today is the rising cost of living. Many cities are becoming increasingly expensive to live in, leading to a widening gulf between the rich and the poor. In addition, the lack of affordable housing has led to increasing homelessness and displacement of low-income individuals and families. The rise in living costs has also led to a lack of well-paying jobs, exacerbating economic inequality and forcing more and more people to rely on assistance programs.",
