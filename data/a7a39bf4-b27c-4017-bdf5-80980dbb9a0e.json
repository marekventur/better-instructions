  "output": "Metals generally have characteristics such as malleability, ductility, high electrical and thermal conductivity, metallic luster, and the ability to form alloys. Non-metals have characteristically low electrical and thermal conductivity, they are poor conductors of electrical and heat current, they have no luster, and they are not malleable or ductile.",
