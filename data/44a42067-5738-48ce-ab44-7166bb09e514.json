  "input": "Anencephaly",
  "output": "Anencephaly is caused by errors in the development of the neural tube, a short tube that forms during early development in an embryo and eventually develops into the brain and spinal cord. Anencephaly occurs when the neural tube fails to close properly in the first few weeks of embryonic development, and results in the infant being born without a major portion of their brain and skull.",
