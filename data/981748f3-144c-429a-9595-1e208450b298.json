After spending a few years in his hometown, he decided it was time for a change and set his sights on the small town of Millshire. He packed his bags, grabbed his cat and hit the road, ready for a fresh start. \n\nWhen Jack arrived in Millshire, he was instantly filled with a sense of joy. He found a job, settled into a cozy apartment, and quickly made a few friends. He loved the community feel, the days spent walking in the woods, and exploring the bookstore nearby.
