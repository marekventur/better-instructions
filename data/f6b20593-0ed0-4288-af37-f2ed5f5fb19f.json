  "output": "Three methods that can be used to reduce global warming include reducing energy consumption, switching to renewable energy sources, and protecting and restoring global forests. Reducing energy consumption can be achieved through energy-efficient building materials and insulation, as well as more efficient appliances and lifestyle habits. Switching to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power can help reduce carbon emissions. Protecting and restoring global forests can reduce emissions and increase carbon sequestration.",
