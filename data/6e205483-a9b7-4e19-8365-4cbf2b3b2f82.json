  "input": "",
  "output": "The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto principle, states that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. This principle can be applied to business, economics, productivity, and other areas. In terms of business, it means that 80% of the results a company produces come from 20% of its efforts. This principle can be used to help business owners prioritize tasks and allocate resources more effectively. By understanding the 80/20 rule, businesses can identify the most important elements of their operations and focus their attention on those to achieve maximum efficiency.",
