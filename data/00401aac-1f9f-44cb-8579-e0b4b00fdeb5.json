  "input": "",
  "output": "Computers use Machine Learning algorithms to recognize patterns. These algorithms analyse large datasets to identify common characteristics between data points. The computer can then use these characteristics to identify patterns when presented with new data. For example, a computer might use an algorithm to identify clusters of points that have similar shapes or biometric characteristics in order to identify a person.",
