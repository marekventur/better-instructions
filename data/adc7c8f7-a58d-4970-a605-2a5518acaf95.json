  "input": "",
  "output": "The waterfall software development model is a sequential engineering process that consists of four primary stages: \n\n1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis: In this stage, the project scope is defined, customer requirements are collected, the scope and the list of requirements are validated, and the project plan is finalized.\n\n2. Design: In this stage, the design of the system and its architecture is developed, a software design document is created, and the design is validated prior to implementation.\n\n3. Implementation or Code Development: During this stage, the actual software application is developed according to the agreed-upon specifications.\n\n4. Testing: Once the code is written, it is thoroughly tested in order to ensure that the developed product meets the requirements and is ready to be deployed.\n\n5. Maintenance: Once the software is deployed, the product is maintained and monitored for any defects in order to keep it running smoothly, and upgrades or improvements can be made as needed.",
