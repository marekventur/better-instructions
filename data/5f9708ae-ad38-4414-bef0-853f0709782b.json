  "input": "",
  "output": "The chatbot would first ask the user what type of cake they would like to bake. If the user responds with a specific type, the chatbot will look up recipes that fit the user's criteria, such as a chocolate cake. If the user does not specify a type, the chatbot can provide popular recipes like vanilla cake, carrot cake, or red velvet cake. After providing the user with several recipes, it can then ask if the user is satisfied or would like additional suggestions.",
