  "input": "",
  "output": "The Ancient Egyptians built the pyramids by cutting large limestone blocks from nearby quarries and dragging and lifting them into place with the help of specially designed sledges, ropes, and wooden levers. They also used pulleys, levers, and a system of counterweights to raise and maneuver the massive stones. Some of the pyramids also incorporated an external ramp which wrapped around the outside, allowing them to slowly and carefully move the stone blocks into place.",
