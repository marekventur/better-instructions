  "input": "",
  "output": "An electric fan and an air conditioner both serve the purpose of cooling down an environment, but they have some distinct differences. An electric fan simply circulates the already-existing air in the room, whereas an air conditioner cools the air by going through a refrigeration cycle. An electric fan has a limited cooling ability, whereas an air conditioner can cool down air to a much lower temperature. Additionally, electric fans are more cost-effective than air conditioners.",
