  "output": "It was the last day of summer and Sam was feeling bittersweet about the end of the season. He had spent most of his time at the beach, soaking in the sun and watching the waves crash on the shore, but now it was time to go back to reality. \n\nSam was going away to college in the fall and he hadn't said goodbye to all of his friends yet. He packed his things one last time and decided to go to a special spot he had found near the beach. It was a rocky cliff that overlooked the entire coastline and provided the best views of the sunset. \n\nHe took in the sight one last time and watched as the day slowly wound down. As the sun disappeared below the horizon, Sam felt a strange calmness wash over him. He knew that no matter what his future held, he had made lots of memories to carry with him; memories that he could look back on, long after the summer had gone.",
