  "input": "Temperature, Humidity, Wind_Speed, Outdoor_Activity\n\n50,30, 6, Hiking\n60,25, 3, Sunbathing\n45,50, 30, Rainy\n80,20, 8, Swimming",
  "output": "The classification model can determine an outdoor activity given the temperature, humidity and wind speed. For example, if the temperature is 50 degrees, humidity is 30%, and wind speed is 6, the outdoor activity is likely to be hiking. Similarly, if the temperature is 80 degrees, humidity is 20%, and wind speed is 8, the outdoor activity is likely to be swimming.",
