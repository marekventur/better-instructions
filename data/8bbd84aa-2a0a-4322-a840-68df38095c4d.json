  "input": "",
  "output": "Two ways to reduce reliance on single use plastic are to switch to reusable containers and to support local businesses that reduce or eliminate plastic packaging. To switch to reusable containers, one should invest in sustainable materials such as glass or stainless steel that are easy to clean and can be used for a variety of purposes such as drinking and storing food. Additionally, supporting businesses that prioritize sustainability by offering options such as zero-waste or refillable products, can help create demand and make these alternatives more widely available.",
