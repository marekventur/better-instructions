  "input": "",
  "output": "To poach an egg perfectly, start by boiling a pot of water over medium heat. Once the water is boiling, reduce heat to low and swirl it gently with a spoon. Crack the egg gently into a cup and slowly slip it into the center of the pot. Cook the egg for 3\u20135 minutes until the white is cooked and the yolk is still runny. Then use a slotted spoon to remove the egg to a plate.",
