The Dragon guarded the kingdom from any trespassers and enemies. One day, a brave Knight arrived with the mission to defeat the Dragon and bring the kingdom under his own rule. The Princess was horrified and immediately summoned the Dragon to protect the kingdom. After a fierce battle, the Knight gave up and the Princess was relieved that the kingdom was spared. In appreciation for his brave stance, the Princess bestowed upon the Knight a title of honor and declared him the protector of the kingdom, forever.",
