  "output": "A professional email etiquette for the workplace involves writing emails with a courteous and respectful tone, staying on topic and avoiding lengthy emails, using appropriate punctuation and formatting, and outlining the exact action you would like the recipient to take. Writing emails in a polite and respectful manner will ensure that your message is taken seriously and that any reply or action is done eagerly. Keeping emails concise and on-topic will also ensure that underlying messages are understood and not lost in details. Correctly formatting emails with headers, punctuation, and spacing is important to enable ease of reading and understanding. Lastly, outlining the exact action you need from the recipient makes it simpler and easier to communicate the desired outcome.",
