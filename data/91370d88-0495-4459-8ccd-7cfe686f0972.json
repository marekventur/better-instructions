  "input": "",
  "output": "Smartphones offer a variety of creative uses beyond the typical communication and entertainment functions. For example, they can be used to create new forms of art, such as virtual and augmented reality art, as well as being used as tools to learn new skills, such as photography or coding. Smartphones can also be used to take advantage of location-based technologies, such as geotagging photos and checking in with friends. Additionally, they can be used to stay organized by managing calendars, setting reminders, and keeping track of tasks.",
