  "input": "Material: Carbon fiber",
  "output": "Carbon fiber is a strong, lightweight material made from carbon atoms linked together in small fibers. It is one of the most popular composite materials as it is strong, lightweight, flexible, and has excellent fatigue and corrosion resistance. Carbon fiber is also resistant to shrinkage and temperature fluctuations, making it an ideal material for product applications.",
