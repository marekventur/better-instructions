  "input": "",
  "output": "The two main states of matter - solid, liquid and gas - have different properties. Liquids are flexible and take the shape of their containers, while gases are diffuse and fill containers. Liquids also have definite volumes, while gases expand to fill the space they occupy. Liquids can also dissolve solids, while gases mix homogenously.",
