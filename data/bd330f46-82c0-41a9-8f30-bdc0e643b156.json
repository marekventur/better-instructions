  "instruction": "Describe how you would handle a customer complaint",
  "input": "",
  "output": "I would listen attentively and try to understand the customer's issue. I would empathize with the customer and try to calm them down if they seem to be very angry. I would then try to explain the situation and ask the customer what kind of solution they are looking for. Depending on what the customer is looking for, I would try to work with them to come up with a reasonable solution that both sides can agree upon.",
