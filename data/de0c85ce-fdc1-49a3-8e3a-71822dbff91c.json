  "output": "2021 is set to be a year of bold, striking design trends. Minimalism and simplicity\u2014which were popular in 2020\u2014will continue to be an important part of design for the year, with flat illustrations and muted color palettes being all the rage. Bright, popping colors and textures will also be in abundance, as well as a focus on multimedia and 3D elements. Plant- and nature-inspired designs will also remain popular, as more and more people are looking to incorporate nature in their design. Artisanal and handmade designs are also being seen more in 2021, providing a unique, personalized touch.",
