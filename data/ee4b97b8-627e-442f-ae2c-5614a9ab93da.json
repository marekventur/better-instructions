  "instruction": "Provide a specific application of a deep learning model.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of a deep learning model application is image recognition. A convolutional neural network (CNN) can be trained on a large set of images to recognize different objects and patterns. The same model can then be implemented to recognize images in real-time applications like facial recognition in security systems or car detection in autonomous driving systems. It can also be used for more complex tasks like visual search and natural language processing.",
