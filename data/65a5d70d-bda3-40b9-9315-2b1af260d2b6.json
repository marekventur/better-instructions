  "input": "",
  "output": "Intelligent agents use AI to solve problems by leveraging the power of machine learning, natural language processing and other advanced AI technologies. These agents can be programmed to observe a problem, develop a hypothesis, test it, and take appropriate action by learning through experience. They have the ability to analyze data, identify patterns in the environment and then use this evidence to generate decisions quickly and accurately. By taking this approach, intelligent agents can achieve better performance than traditional problem-solving algorithms.",
