  "instruction": "Summarize the text describing the life cycle of a butterfly.",
  "input": "Butterflies go through four stages during their life cycle: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The first step of the life cycle is the egg. A female butterfly lays from dozens to hundreds of eggs on the underside of leaves of plants. The next stage is the larva which hatches from the eggs. The larva, or caterpillar, eat and grow in size over the next few weeks, they molt several times before they become ready to enter the pupa stage. Butterflies spend most of their time in the chrysalis, or pupa stage.  During this time, the caterpillar changes into an adult butterfly. Finally, when the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, it can fly, feed and mate.",
  "output": "The life cycle of a butterfly consists of four stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The female butterfly lays eggs on plants, which hatch into larvae. The larvae feed and molt until they reach the pupa stage, where they remain until becoming adult butterflies, which can fly, feed and mate.",
