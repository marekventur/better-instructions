  "input": "",
  "output": "Renewable energy sources have many advantages compared to fossil fuels. They are generally more sustainable, as they can be replenished much faster than non-renewable sources such as coal, oil and natural gas. Renewable energy sources also create fewer emissions, making them better for the environment. They also do not require as much extraction and transportation as fossil fuels, which reduces the environmental impact associated with their use. Additionally, renewable energy sources can be used to produce electricity and heat, allowing them to complement or even replace traditional sources.\n\nHowever, renewable energy sources come with their own set of disadvantages. For one, many renewable energy sources require large areas of land in order to be installed, meaning they are not as suitable for areas with limited space. Additionally, they tend to be more expensive than traditional energy sources and require high initial investments. Lastly, some renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, are intermittent, meaning they are only available when conditions are favorable.",
