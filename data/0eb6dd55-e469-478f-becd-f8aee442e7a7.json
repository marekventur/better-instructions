  "instruction": "Name and explain a difference between Buddhism and Hinduism",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the main differences between Buddhism and Hinduism is their understanding of the concept of karma. Hinduism teaches that karma is an important part of the cosmic cycle of reincarnation, whereas Buddhism teaches that karma is one of the causes of suffering, and through Buddhist practice, suffering can be mitigated and can ultimately be avoided. Moreover, Buddhism denies the notion of a permanent or eternal soul, which is central to Hinduism. Additionally, while Hinduism places a great emphasis on rituals and spiritual practices, Buddhism is more concerned with cultivating a compassionate attitude towards others.",
