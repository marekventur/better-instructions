  "input": "",
  "output": "Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower can play a significant role in reducing dependence on non-renewable energy sources, such as fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources are infinite, meaning they will never run out, and are more efficient to generate than non-renewable sources. They are also more cost-effective in the long term, as they do not require the same costly extraction and transportation costs as fossil fuels. Additionally, renewable energy sources produce less air pollution, resulting in a cleaner environment.",
