  "output": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and Great Britain. The war began due to the United States trying to protect its shipping interests and trading rights, as well as trying to annex Canada. After two years of fighting, no part of Canada had been annexed by the United States. England also failed to achieve its goal of crushing the United States\u2019 naval power. The war ended in a stalemate, and both sides agreed to sign the Treaty of Ghent in 1814, which finalized a status quo without any territory changes.",
