  "output": "Some solutions to reduce air pollution include introducing cleaner transportation options like public transportation and electric vehicles, as well as incentives to generate renewable energy such as wind or solar power. Additionally, industries should be encouraged to reduce their emissions through technological innovation and stricter standards, and households should be urged to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels through more efficient appliances and better insulation. Planting trees and implementing urban forestry measures can also help reduce air pollution.",
