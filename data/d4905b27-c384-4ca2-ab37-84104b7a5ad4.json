  "input": "Prompt: It was a night like any other, until a mysterious stranger walked up to them at the bar.",
  "output": "The bar was quiet, except for the faint hum of chatter from the patrons. As I sipped my drink, I felt someone step up behind me. I turned around to see a mysterious figure dressed in a long black cloak. The stranger smiled, and simply said, \"hello, I'm here to find the one I'm looking for.\" Before I could reply, the stranger walked away and out of the bar. After that night, I never returned to that bar, always aware of the mysterious figure who lurked in the shadows.",
