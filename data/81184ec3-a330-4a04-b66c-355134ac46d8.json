  "output": "Artificial intelligence can be used to help people in a number of ways. For example, AI can be used to develop smarter and more efficient healthcare systems, to automate certain tasks and make them more efficient, to improve safety and security, and to automate customer service tasks. AI can also be used to offer personalized recommendations and assistive technologies for people with disabilities. AI can also be used for practical applications, including helping people with their job searches or aiding students with their studies. Furthermore, AI can be used to help people by providing faster and more accurate fraud detection, or helping to analyze large amounts of data and uncover insights that would otherwise be hard to find. Finally, AI can also be used to create unbiased decision-making systems and minimize bias in decision-making. Ultimately, the possibilities for using AI to help people are truly endless.",
