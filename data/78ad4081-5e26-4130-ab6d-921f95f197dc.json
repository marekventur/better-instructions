  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change is having a significant impact on the world's oceans. As the climate warms, the ocean absorbs much of the heat and stores it, leading to warmer and more acidic waters, which can have direct impacts on marine species. Warmer waters can cause coral bleaching, while more acidic water can lead to difficulty for oysters, mussels and other shellfish to build and maintain their shells. Additionally, sea levels are rising, leading to increased flooding of coastal and island communities and destruction of wildlife habitats. \n\nAdditionally, changes to ocean circulation patterns can lead to more extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. Climate change can also alter the availability of food supplies for ocean creatures, and has been linked with increasing number of disease outbreaks among some marine species.",
