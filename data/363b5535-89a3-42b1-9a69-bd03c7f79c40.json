  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a hard-working ant who stored up food for the winter months. Every time she gathered food, she shared it with the other ants. Even when there was very little food, she was determined to do her part and help her colony. \n\nOne day, a lazy cricket came by and refused to help with the work. Despite this, the ant continued to share her resources and soon the cricket was enjoying the same meals as everyone else. \n\nMoral of the story: Sharing is caring! No matter how small your contribution is, it can make a big difference in helping others and making the world a better place.",
