  "input": "\"We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us, with nothing to show for our progress except a memory of the smell of smoke, and a presumption that once our eyes watered.\"",
  "output": "The quote by Tom Stoppard implies that we should take life one step at a time and not be too focused on our progress. We should acknowledge our past but not dwell on it, and live our lives thoughtfully. The smell of smoke serves as a reminder of our past decisions and that we should not be content with our progress and should always strive to be better than before.",
