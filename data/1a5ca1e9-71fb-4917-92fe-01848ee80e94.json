  "input": "",
  "output": "Lightning is created when positive and negative charges accumulate in the atmosphere, particularly in a storm system. Positive charges build up in the upper part of the clouds, while negative charges accumulate in the lower part. As the charges accumulate, an electric field forms between them. When the charges reach a strong enough level, the electric field becomes powerful enough to cause an electrical breakdown of the air, and then an exchange of electricity occurs from the cloud to the ground, forming a lightning bolt.",
