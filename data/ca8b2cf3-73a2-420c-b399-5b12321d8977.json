  "input": "",
  "output": "The most common emergency procedure during a fire is to evacuate the building and call 911. Everyone should exit the building as quickly and calmly as possible, making sure all doors and windows are closed so the fire does not spread. Additionally, everyone should stay low to the ground (crawl if possible) to avoid smoke and heat. Once outside, people should move to a safe distance from the building and call 911 to alert the fire department.",
