  "output": "Three ways to resolve a family dispute are as follows:\n\n1. Open communication: Encourage family members to openly discuss the issue at hand, while being mindful of the emotions of others.\n\n2. Respectful negotiation: Try to reach consensus through respectful negotiation. Each family member should try to understand the other\u2019s point of view and come to an agreement that is beneficial for all.\n\n3. Seek professional help: If the family dispute is severe, it may be beneficial to seek help from a qualified professional. A therapist or counselor can help to mediate the situation and offer impartial advice. Alternatively, couples counseling can help to address underlying issues that have led to the dispute.",
