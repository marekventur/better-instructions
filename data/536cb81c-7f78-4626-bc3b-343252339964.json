  "output": "360\u00b0 feedback is a process in which employees receive feedback from multiple sources, such as their manager, colleagues, and customers, as opposed to just their manager. This feedback is intended to provide a comprehensive view of an employee's performance and development potential. By gathering feedback from multiple sources, it can provide an objective overview of an employee's strengths and weaknesses which can be used to improve their performance and development.",
