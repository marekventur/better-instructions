  "output": "The United States operates under a mixed economy, which is a system that combines free-market capitalism with governmental, economic regulations. This system allows businesses to compete in a free, competitive market while protecting consumers and providing employment and safety regulations. Additionally, the government provides social services, including education, health care and infrastructure. In this way, it seeks to balance the needs of both the market and society.",
