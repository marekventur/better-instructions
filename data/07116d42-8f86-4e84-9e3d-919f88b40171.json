  "input": "The dataset contains information about forest fires in California.",
  "output": "A tree-shaped design where each leaf displays the size of the forest fire and its respective location in California. The leaves can be color-coded to represent different levels of forest fire activity. The tree could also have root systems or branches connecting the leaves, representing major fire causes such as dry weather or lightning strikes.",
