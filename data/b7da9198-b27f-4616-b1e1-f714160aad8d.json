  "input": "",
  "output": "The internet can be thought of as a giant interconnected network of computers, servers, and networks that communicate with each other. To access the internet, a user's device must be able to send and receive data via the internet by connecting to a local network. This can be done by either plugging in a physical connection into the device or connecting to a local Wi-Fi network. Then, the data travels between the user's device and the internet service provider, which is then routed to the correct destination by routers. Data is then sent back in a similar manner. This chain of events occurs in a matter of milliseconds, allowing us to access information almost instantaneously.",
