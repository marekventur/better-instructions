  "input": "",
  "output": "Exponential growth is a phenomenon in which an amount increases at an increasing rate over time. It is usually represented by a graph where the amount doubles over time. The effect of exponential growth can be seen in various aspects of the world. For instance, populations of certain species can exponentially increase with favorable conditions, while the spread of diseases can exponentially increase when left unchecked. Technology can also undergo exponential growth if there is strong demand and a rapid rate of innovation. Ultimately, exponential growth can help bring about tangible change when managed in a controlled manner, or create serious problems when left unchecked.",
