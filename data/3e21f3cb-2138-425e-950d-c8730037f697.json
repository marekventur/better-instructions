  "output": "Manifest Destiny was a 19th century belief that the United States was destined to expand its territory and influence from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It was often used to justify the annexation of land held by Native American tribes or Mexico, as well as settlers' expansion into the West. The concept of Manifest Destiny was seen as the driving force of American expansion, and many believed that it was the nation's obligation to spread freedom and democracy across the continent.",
