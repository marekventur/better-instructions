  "output": "1. Nature's beauty blooms / Silent hum of summer breeze / Comfort and joy found\n2. Morning birdsong so pure / Shining sunlight spreads the warmth / Nature afresh with life\n3. Cool breeze rustles leaves / Brings sweet song with whisper soft / Refreshes tired soul\n4. Blue sky vast and clear / Clouds bejewelled hung in mute grace / Earth in wonderment\n5. Trees majestic green / Ladybirds jovial flights past / Boundless joy of life.",
