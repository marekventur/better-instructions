  "output": "John Smith is an eighth-grade student in Mrs. Sarah's Math class. He consistently earns As and Bs on his tests and homework assignments. He volunteers to answer questions during lessons, and participates in class discussions. His schoolwork shows he understands the material and has a good grasp of logical reasoning and problem-solving. He independently completes projects, and often brings in extra resources to further explain concepts. Despite his strong performance in Math, John feels some frustration when his work is compared to his classmates, who often have higher test scores. He is motivated to do better and is working on honing his math skills with the help of his parents.",
