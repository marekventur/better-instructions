  "input": "",
  "output": "Parallel computing is a type of computing architecture that allows multiple calculations or tasks to be carried out simultaneously. This means that instead of the usual process of having a single processor take care of all of the tasks in a certain time period, parallel computing allows for multiple processors to work on different tasks at the same time. This allows for more complex and difficult tasks to be completed more quickly than with traditional computing methods.",
