  "input": "",
  "output": "A marketing funnel is a multi-step process that businesses use to guide prospective customers through their journey from discovering and learning about a company's services or products, to eventually becoming a customer. The marketing funnel is typically composed of multiple stages that a customer must progress through before making a purchase. Common stages in a funnel include awareness, interest, consideration, intent, purchase, and loyalty. Each stage serves a different purpose and provides companies with valuable data points to measure and refine their strategies.",
