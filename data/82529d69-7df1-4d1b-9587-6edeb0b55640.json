  "instruction": "Describe the major differences between public and private cloud",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The major difference between public and private cloud is the ownership and control of resources. Public cloud is owned and managed by a service provider such as AWS or Google Cloud and is typically used by companies that require scalability, speed, and cost savings. Private cloud, on the other hand, is owned and managed by the organization itself and is more suitable for those organizations that require privacy, security, and control. Both public and private clouds offer benefits, but the primary distinction between them is who owns and manages the resources.",
