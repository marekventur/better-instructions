  "instruction": "Build a binary classifier to differentiate between apples and oranges.",
  "input": "Apple: red, round, tart | Orange: orange, round, sweet",
  "output": "The classifier would use the data given to separate apples and oranges. It would focus on the differentiating features, such as color, shape, and flavor, to accurately assign each item to its corresponding category. For example, apples being red and oranges being orange would be used to differentiate between the two fruits. Similarly, roundness is a distinguishing feature between apples and oranges, with apples being round and oranges being oval. Lastly, apples are usually tart while oranges are usually sweet, giving another way to differentiate between the two fruits.",
