  "instruction": "Discuss the impacts of a trade tariff on US businesses",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A trade tariff is a tax applied to goods and services imported into the US. Tariffs can increase the cost of imported products and make them less competitive than domestically-produced goods. This can lead to decreased demand for imported goods, and businesses that rely heavily on imports can suffer financially. It can also lead to higher costs for US businesses that rely on imported parts, materials, and services. Additionally, if US businesses are unable to compete domestically due to higher costs, they can be forced to downsize, relocate, or even close permanently.",
