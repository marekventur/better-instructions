  "input": "",
  "output": "The precision recall tradeoff, also known as the accuracy-recall tradeoff, is an important concept in machine learning. This phenomenon occurs as model accuracy and recall (the number of relevant items retrieved relative to the total amount of relevant items) are often inversely related. In other words, as accuracy increases, recall typically decreases, and vice versa, meaning improvements in one aspect of the model can often come at the cost of another.",
