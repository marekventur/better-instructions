  "input": "",
  "output": "If I had to spend a night in a deserted island, the essential items I need for survival would be water, food, shelter, a tool (e.g. knife, ax, saw), and a fire starter (e.g. matches, lighter). These items would be essential to ensure my safety and well-being while I am on the island. Additionally, it would be a good idea to have a flashlight or headlamp in case of darkness. Lastly, I would need a means of communication to be able to call for help, whether it is a cell phone or a whistle.",
