  "input": "",
  "output": "I would create a digital photo album that begins with photos from 10 years ago, when I was a college student. I would include photos from memorable trips I went on, parties I attended, and places I went. Over the years, photos of family and friends I made, special occasions, and random snapshots of everyday life would be compiled in the album. I would edit in captions, graphics, and other creative elements, and perhaps even add audio files or video clips. Through the album, I could relive the last 10 years of my life and share my experiences with family and friends.",
