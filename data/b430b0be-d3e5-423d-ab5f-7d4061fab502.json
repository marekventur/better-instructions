  "input": "",
  "output": "The classical architecture of Ancient Greece and Rome have a number of similarities and differences. Both civilizations used the same basic elements of architecture, such as columns, arches, and domes, but their implementations of them were distinct in many ways. \n\nGreek architecture was characterized by a more restrained use of ornamentation and simpler forms, while Roman architecture was much more ornate and featured more intricate details. Greek architecture favored proportion and harmony in design, while Roman architecture favored a bold grandeur. \n\nGreek temples, for example, were typically built on a raised platform from a single block of stone and usually featured a single room, while Roman temples were constructed from several different materials and often featured elaborate, multiple-roomed designs. Greek columns were distinct for their tapered shape, while Roman columns were much thicker and featured decorative elements. \n\nOverall, the main difference between the two architectural styles can be summed up as follows: Greek architecture favored aesthetics and proportion, while Roman architecture favored grandeur and imposing structure.",
