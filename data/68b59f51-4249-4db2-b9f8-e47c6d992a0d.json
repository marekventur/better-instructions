  "output": "A creative way to host a virtual birthday party is to organize a game night! Invite everyone to pick their favorite board games, card games, or video games and give everyone a turn to host a game. For example, the first person could host virtual Charades and the next person could host a game of online chess. You could also organize a quiz night and have fun competing to see who knows the birthday person best. For an added touch, provide everyone with prizes for the winners of each game.",
