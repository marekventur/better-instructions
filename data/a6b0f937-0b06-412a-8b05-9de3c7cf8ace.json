  "output": "Analog signals are continuously varying signals, whereas digital signals are binary signals that represent either a 0 or 1. Analog signals are usually generated by devices like microphones and cameras, while digital signals are generated by digital components like microprocessors and computers. Analog signals are prone to noise, while digital signals are less susceptible to signal noise.",
