  "output": "A young girl named Iris was out in her backyard, kicking a soccer ball around and enjoying the warm sunshine. Suddenly, she noticed something in the grass near the fence \u2013 a mysterious note! Intrigued, she picked it up and read it. \n\nThe note said: \u201cMeet me at the old abandoned house on the outskirts of town at midnight tonight. I have something to show you.\u201d \n\nFilled with curiosity, Iris went to the old house. When she arrived, she saw that the door was slightly ajar. She opened the door and stepped inside. The house was empty and dusty, but there was an eerie feeling in the air. Suddenly, a voice from the shadows startled her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, don\u2019t be scared,\u201d said an old lady. She stepped out of the darkness and walked towards Iris. \u201cI\u2019ve been expecting you.\u201d\n\nThe old lady told Iris that she was a witch and had been watching her from the shadows for some time. She said that Iris had a special gift, and that she wanted to teach her how to use it. With the old witch\u2019s help, Iris unlocked powerful magic within herself that she had never known she possessed.\n\nAfter a night of learning and wonder, Iris left the old house with her newfound knowledge and a newfound sense of confidence. From that day forward, she went on to do many amazing things in the world, all because she had discovered that mysterious note in her backyard.",
