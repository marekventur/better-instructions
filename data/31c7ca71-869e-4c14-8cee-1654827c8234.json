  "input": "",
  "output": "One possible solution to the environmental issue of air pollution is to switch to cleaner energy sources like renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. This can be done by shifting away from the burning of fossil fuels, which causes pollutants to be released into the atmosphere. Additionally, governments and citizens can promote the use of electric vehicles over gasoline-powered cars, and the adoption of energy-efficient home appliances. These steps would reduce the emissions of harmful gases, thus helping to improve the quality of air and reduce the effects of air pollution.",
