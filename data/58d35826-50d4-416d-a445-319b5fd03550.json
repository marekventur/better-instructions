  "output": "Tropical rainforests are mainly found near the equator in hot, humid regions and experience high levels of precipitation throughout the year. These forests feature broadleaf trees, a variety of plants, vines, and epiphytes, and a complex layering of different types of vegetation. In contrast, temperate rainforests are located in cooler climate regions, such as the Pacific Northwest of the United States, and experience seasonal precipitation. These forests are typically made up of coniferous trees, dense understory vegetation, and moss. Tropical rainforests also tend to have higher species diversity and biomass than temperate rainforests.",
