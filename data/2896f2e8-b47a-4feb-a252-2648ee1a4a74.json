  "output": "One alternative to consuming animal products is plant-based products. Plant-based proteins such as legumes, nuts, and seeds are a high-quality source of nutrition and can provide essential nutrients and vitamins needed for a healthy diet. In addition, plant-based products often contain fewer calories, fat, and cholesterol than animal products.
