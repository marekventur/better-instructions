  "output": "The stars were twinkling in the night sky,\nLike diamonds in the darkness they shone so high.\nThe moonlight shimmered with a silver hue,\nReflecting on the calm and peaceful view.\n\nThe sky was a sea of stars and gleaming light,\nEach one a brilliant spark of heavenly sight.\nThe night was filled with an ethereal glow,\nA beautiful canopy of silver and snow.\n\nThe constellations painted the night so fair,\nIn a way that beauty and wonder were rare.\nIt was a moment so pure, so divine,\nIt almost felt like there was no time.\n\nThe stars were twinkling in the night sky,\nA romantic reminder of love passing by.\nMemories of peaceful beauty in the sky,\nForever in my heart, will linger on high.",
