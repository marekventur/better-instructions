  "input": "",
  "output": "Social media has drastically changed the way we communicate with each other, both positively and negatively. It can facilitate conversations and give people a platform to share their ideas, but it also can lead to misinterpretations, spam, and trolling. It has made it easy to connect with people all over the world, but also can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. Social media can provide an important avenue for communication, but it also brings potential risks.",
