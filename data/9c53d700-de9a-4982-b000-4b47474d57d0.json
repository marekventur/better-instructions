Once the water has reached a boil, remove it from the heat and add 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee to a coffee filter. Place the filter into a coffee maker or French press and pour the boiled water in slowly. Let the coffee steep for about 4 minutes, or until it reaches the desired strength, then carefully remove the filter with the coffee grounds. Pour the coffee into a mug and enjoy!",
