  "output": "A creative solution to an environmental problem is to create a program that incentivizes homeowners to invest in solar energy. This could be done on a voluntary basis with incentives such as tax credits or rebates to attract more people to make the switch to clean energy. This program could be administered through the local government or utility companies. Community-based organizations could help spread the word, provide resources, and provide education and support to households looking to make the switch.",
