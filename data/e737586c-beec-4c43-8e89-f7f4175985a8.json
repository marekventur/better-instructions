  "input": "",
  "output": "Reverse engineering is a process used in software engineering to analyze a given software and identify its components, then reproduce the software in order to understand its structure and behavior. This process may involve looking at the source code, reverse compiling, data mining, testing, and other techniques. The purpose of reverse engineering is to determine how a system works in order to find any vulnerabilities or flaws so that they can be fixed, build compatible systems, and improve upon existing software.",
