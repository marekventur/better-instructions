  "instruction": "Explain why these two stories have a different tone.",
  "input": "Story 1: An enterprising young man made it big in the business world.\n\nStory 2: An ambitious youngster rose to the top of the corporate ladder.",
  "output": "Story 1 has a more positive tone, as it emphasizes the man\u2019s enterprising qualities and implies that his success was due to his ambition. Story 2, however, has a more neutral tone, simply noting that the youngster rose to the top but not ascribing any particular qualities to him.",
