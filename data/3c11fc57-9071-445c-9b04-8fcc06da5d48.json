  "instruction": "Analyze the cooperation between A and B.",
  "input": "A and B have been friends for 10 years, but have recently been arguing a lot.",
  "output": "The relationship between A and B has gone through a period of strain and turmoil. After 10 years of being close friends, disagreements have begun to arise making the relationship more challenging. The cause of the disputes is likely related to changing circumstances or underlying issues that were not addressed early on in the friendship. In order to improve the relationship, it is important to reflect on the issues at hand, examine how each party is contributing to the disagreements, and clearly express how each party may be feeling. Genuine communication and listening to each other is the key to building a strong foundation and understanding each other.",
