  "output": "Ben had 1000 dollars, and every month he deposited 200 dollars in his savings account. If he kept doing this for four years, how much money did he have in his account at the end of four years?\n\nAnswer: At the end of four years, Ben had 8000 dollars in his savings account. This was calculated by 1000 + (200 x 12 x 4) = 8000, where 1000 is the initial amount, 200 is the amount he deposits every month, 12 is the number of months in a year, and 4 is the number of years. Thus, the four operations used in this problem are addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.",
