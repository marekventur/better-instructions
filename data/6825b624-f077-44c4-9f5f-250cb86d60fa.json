  "input": "The Law of Supply and Demand",
  "output": "Take the example of a popular grocery store chain. The demand for milk is generally quite constant, so it is not difficult for the store to keep up with demand. However, if the store runs a sale on milk and reduces the price for a certain period of time, there is a huge increase in demand. This is an example of the law of supply and demand; when the supply is lower than the demand, prices rise and when the supply is higher than the demand, prices fall.",
