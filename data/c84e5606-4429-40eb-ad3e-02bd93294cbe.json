  "input": "",
  "output": "Gene editing is a technology that can be used to make specific changes to an organism's DNA to potentially produce desired traits. One possible use of gene editing is to develop new pharmaceutical drugs by altering the genetic instructions of microorganisms to produce desired chemicals and compounds. Additionally, gene editing can be used to develop pest resistance in crops and improve livestock breeding programs.",
