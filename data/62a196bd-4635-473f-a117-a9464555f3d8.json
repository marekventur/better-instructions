  "instruction": "Describe the difference between a router and a switch",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A router receives packets from a network and routes them to their designated destination, while a switch is a network device that connects multiple devices together on the same LAN (Local Area Network). Routers connect networks together and allow for communication between them, while switches connect computers together within a single network. A switch also reads data from incoming packets and forwards it to the appropriate output port.",
