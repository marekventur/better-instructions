  "output": "JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for front-end web development. It runs in the browser, so it can create interactive elements in web pages and create dynamic interactions between webpages and users. Its salient features include asynchronous processing, which allows users to perform multiple operations at once; support for multiple data types; variables that can contain different types of data; event handling, which allows scripts to respond to user actions; and support for many popular libraries and frameworks.",
