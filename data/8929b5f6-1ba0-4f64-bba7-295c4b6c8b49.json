  "input": "",
  "output": "Civil engineering can help a community in many ways. For example, civil engineers can help design and construct roads, bridges, and other structures for the community. This allows for an improved quality of life for the citizens by providing efficient access to different areas of the town. In addition, civil engineers can help devise efficient water and sewer systems, which provide clean and safe water for drinking and other daily activities. Civil engineers are also responsible for designing and constructing buildings that can withstand natural disasters such as flooding, earthquakes, and hurricanes. By doing this, civil engineers help protect the community from potential harm.",
