  "input": "",
  "output": "Deep learning is a powerful machine learning technique used for predictive analytics and automated decision-making. One example of deep learning applied to computer vision is object recognition. Deep learning techniques can be used to identify and classify objects in digital images. By using deep learning algorithms, computers can learn to identify objects and differentiate between them. This can be used for applications such as autonomous driving, video analysis, and image classification. In addition, deep learning algorithms can be used to anticipate possible changes in a scene, such as changes in lighting or in the positioning of objects.",
