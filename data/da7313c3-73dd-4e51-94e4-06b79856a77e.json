  "input": "",
  "output": "There are a few potential causes for a laptop that won't turn on, including a faulty power supply, a drained battery, an outdated BIOS, and a loose connection from the power cord to the laptop. Try plugging the power cord into a different outlet and check the power adapter for any frayed or broken wires. Also, check the battery for any issues. If the power button is not working, the BIOS may no longer be up to date; try updating the BIOS or resetting it to factory settings.",
