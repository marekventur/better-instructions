  "input": "In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has become increasingly commonplace. AI applications promise to make healthcare more efficient, cost-effective, and accurate, but their application raises ethical questions. To ensure a safe technology, researchers need to consider the potential harm of AI systems and be emotionally engaged with the outcome of their machine learning processes. Artificial Intelligence in healthcare should be supervised and regulated to ensure transparency about its decision making processes and its resultant impacts. Furthermore, algorithms should be tested for bias to avoid any unfair impacts, and there should be clear guidelines for development, use and goverance of AI systems.",
