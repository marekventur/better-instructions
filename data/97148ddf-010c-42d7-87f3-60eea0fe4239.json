  "instruction": "Explain why workers in California have higher minimum wage.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Workers in California have higher minimum wage because California has some of the highest costs of living in the US and the cost of basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare can be high. Additionally, California has also implemented strong labor protections for workers, including a higher minimum wage. This serves to ensure that workers are able to meet their basic needs and to protect workers from exploitative labor practices.",
