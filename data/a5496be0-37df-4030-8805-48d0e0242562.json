  "input": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/nyregion/nyc-taxes-eviction-covid-19.html",
  "output": "New York City recently enacted a series of tax laws in response to the Covid-19 crisis, including the temporary suspension of commercial rent taxes. These tax laws have the potential to help vulnerable New Yorkers by delaying rent and property tax payments, while also providing relief to businesses that were hit hard by the pandemic. Additionally, the new laws would increase the sales tax rate, while decreasing the income tax rate for the city's highest earners.",
