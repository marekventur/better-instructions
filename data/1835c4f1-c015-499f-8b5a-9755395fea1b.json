  "output": "There are several methods to reduce energy costs in a commercial building. These include utilizing energy efficient lighting, such as fluorescent and LED bulbs, utilizing natural light where possible, investing in building insulation, and installing energy efficient HVAC systems. Additionally, installing programmable thermostats or sensors can help regulate temperature in different parts of the building, while automatic timers can be used to turn off equipment and lights when they are not in use. Additionally, providing employees with incentives to reduce their energy consumption can also help reduce energy costs.",
