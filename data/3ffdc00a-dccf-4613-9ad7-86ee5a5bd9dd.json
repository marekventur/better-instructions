  "output": "This article provides a good overview of the expected costs of political and issue-advocacy advertising for the 2008 election cycle, noting the large amount of money that candidates, unions and corporations are willing to spend and stressing that it will be nearly double what was spent in 2004. It is clear from the forecasts made by TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group that the cost of trying to influence the 2008 election will be significantly higher than before and will bring about some interesting changes. It will be interesting to see how this affects the election and whether or not it ultimately leads to more informed voters.",
