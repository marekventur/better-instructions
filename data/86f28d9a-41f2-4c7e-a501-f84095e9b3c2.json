  "output": "Two possible consequences of global warming are increased extreme weather events (such as floods, storms, and heatwaves) and rising sea levels. Other possible effects include altered ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, and an increase in air and water pollution levels. Global warming can also lead to an increase in food and water shortages, along with the spread of infectious diseases. Finally, it could also lead to lower agricultural yields and crop losses.",
