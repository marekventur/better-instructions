  "input": "",
  "output": "Bacterial cells and plant cells have many differences. Bacterial cells are smaller, are prokaryotic, lack a true nucleus, and do not contain membrane-bound organelles. Plant cells, on the other hand, are larger, are eukaryotic, have a true nucleus, and contain membrane-bound organelles such as chloroplasts, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum. Plant cells also have a cell wall and a vacuole that bacteria cells lack.",
