  "input": "",
  "output": "The planet Airtem was home to two species - the Zyteks and the Cralves. The Zyteks were a nomadic species, spending most of their time travelling the planet in caravans. The Cralves were a more settled species, keeping to their own territories. The two species had an uneasy understanding, often trading goods from one place to the other. Over time, the two species adapted to living together, developing unique cultural and linguistic bonds that allowed them to better understand each other. Today, Airtem is a peaceful planet in which two species can live together in harmony.",
