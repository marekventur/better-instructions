  "output": "A distributed database system is a database system that stores data across multiple computers or across multiple locations. An example of a distributed database system is a data warehouse that stores data from multiple locations within an organization in a single shared database. The data is stored in different processing nodes and accessed through a shared network. Additionally, the data can also be replicated to increase reliability and redundancy. This distributed system offers scalability, availability, and higher performance than a centralized database system.",
