  "input": "C and Java",
  "output": "C is a compiled language which is fast and efficient but requires more manual coding. On the other hand, Java is an interpreted language with a higher level of abstraction. It is slower than C but easier to use, reducing development time. Java also has built-in garbage collection, while C does not.",
