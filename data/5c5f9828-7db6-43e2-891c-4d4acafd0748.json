  "output": "Institutional racism is a form of discrimination that is embedded in a range of institutions such as education, healthcare and the legal system. It refers to the way systems and structures are designed and implemented in ways that reproduce advantages and disadvantage to certain racial groups. It can take different forms such as discriminating practices in hiring and promotion decisions, lower quality services for certain racial groups, or unequal educational opportunities. All of these unfair practices can lead to disparities between racial groups in terms of educational attainment, employment, healthcare, and criminal justice.",
