  "output": "The sun and Earth have a unique and symbiotic relationship. The sun is the main source of energy for Earth and provides light and warmth for the planet's plants, animals, and people. This energy is then redistributed around Earth by the atmosphere and ocean currents, which keep temperatures on the planet relatively constant. Without the sun's energy, life on Earth would not be possible.",
