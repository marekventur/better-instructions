  "input": "",
  "output": "AI has the potential to reduce the risks of climate change, from helping to improve energy efficiency, to accurately predicting and modelling climatic events, to helping with the computational simulations that generate new models of climate behavior. AI can also help manage resources and monitor the environment to reduce waste and consumption, as well as helping to track, analyze, and forecast global data such as air pollution and temperature. AI can also be used to optimize renewable energy resources, track waste, and intelligently manage production, making it a powerful tool in the fight against global climate change.",
