  "instruction": "Name three advantages of a content delivery network (CDN).",
  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Improved loading times \u2013 A CDN stores copies of content on multiple servers located around the world. This ensures that content is delivered to users quickly, since they\u2019ll be accessing the content from a server close to them. \n2. Lower bandwidth and costs \u2013 CDNs use caching to reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent over the internet. This reduces bandwidth usage, which in turn leads to lower costs for the user.\n3. Improved reliability and uptime \u2013 Since the same content is stored on multiple CDN servers, the risk of downtime is greatly reduced. This also makes CDN networks more reliable and less likely to suffer from server overloads.",
