  "input": "",
  "output": "Red is like the rising sun, with a sense of energy and intensity that is hard to ignore. It is a deep hue of passion, a hue of fire and courage, a hue that can be felt in the soul. It's an invitation to action and a warning of danger. It is vibrant and bold, a color that can break through the noise. Red is the color of strength and determination.",
