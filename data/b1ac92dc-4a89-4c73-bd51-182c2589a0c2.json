  "input": "",
  "output": "Green energy is an investment in the future that comes with numerous potential benefits. Its implementation serves to reduce pollution, lower emissions of greenhouse gases, and enhance energy security. Additionally, green energy harnesses the natural resources around us, resulting in steady and consistent energy supply. Green energy sources are renewable, meaning that they are sustainable, available indefinitely, and require little maintenance. This also allows for the construction of green energy projects, resulting in job creation in the energy sector. The cost of implementing green energy projects is initially high, but the savings over a period of time are far greater. Finally, green energy presents us with an opportunity to play a part in the fight against climate change and its resulting consequences.",
