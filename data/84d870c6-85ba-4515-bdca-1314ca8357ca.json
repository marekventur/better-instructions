  "output": "One example of a problem that can benefit from artificial intelligence technology is medical diagnosis. AI has the potential to analyze medical images and help doctors identify diseases more quickly and accurately than human doctors, by accurately detecting and diagnosing abnormalities in medical images. AI can also be used to process large amounts of medical data and patient medical history, making it possible to identify patterns that might not be detectable by humans. AI can also be used to speed up administrative processes by automating routine tasks such as appointment scheduling.",
