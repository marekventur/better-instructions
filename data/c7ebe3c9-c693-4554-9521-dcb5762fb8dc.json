  "output": "Machine learning can be used in logistics to optimize the routing of shipments and predict their arrival times. For example, a machine learning system can analyze historic shipment data to determine the most efficient route for a given shipment, accounting for factors such as mileage and traffic conditions. It can also analyze past delivery data to predict the arrival date for a shipment.",
