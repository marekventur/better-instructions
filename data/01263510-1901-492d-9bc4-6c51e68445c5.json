  "input": "",
  "output": "Demand for goods increases when the population increases and consumers have more money to spend, causing an increase in the purchasing power of consumers. In addition, an increase in the price of other goods may lead people to shift their demand to the cheaper goods, resulting in an increase in demand of that good. Improvements in technology can also drive demand, as new products and services become available.",
