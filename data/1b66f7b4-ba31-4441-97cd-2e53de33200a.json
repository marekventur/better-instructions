  "output": "The digestive system is responsible for breaking down and absorbing food and liquids so that the nutrients can be transported to cells throughout the body. It begins with the mouth where food enters and is chewed and mixed with saliva. The chewed food then travels to the stomach where it is broken down even further by strong acids. From there, it passes through the small intestine, where the majority of digestion and absorption into the bloodstream takes place. The partially digested food then moves to the large intestine where water and vitamins are absorbed. Finally, it is passed out of the body as waste.",
