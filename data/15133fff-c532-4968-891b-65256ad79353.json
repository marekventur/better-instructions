  "instruction": "Describe the features and benefits of using biometrics for authentication.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Biometric authentication is the process of using a person's physiological or behavioral characteristics to verify their identity. Common examples include fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, and iris scans. These features are used to verify the identity of someone when compared to records stored in a database. Benefits of biometrics include the accuracy of the process in comparison to passwords and pins, as well as the convenience for the user, since biometric authentication does not require the user to remember or enter any information. Additionally, biometrics can be used for continuous authentication, meaning that they can detect if someone is not who they claim to be. This adds an extra layer of security to any system.",
