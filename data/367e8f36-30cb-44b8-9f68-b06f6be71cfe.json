  "output": "The central message of Robert Frost's poem \"The Road Not Taken\" is that life is full of difficult choices and that the choices an individual makes often have a lasting impact. The poem explains how one person found themselves in a \"yellow wood\" with two roads that led in different directions, and the choice of which path to take was not the same for everyone. The uncertainty of life, and the impact of making a decision is explored in the poem, as it is left uncertain what lies at the end of either of the roads. Ultimately, the poem is about recognizing the importance of making difficult decisions and understanding that life is full of uncertainty and that it is impossible to predict the outcomes of the choices one makes.",
