  "input": "",
  "output": "From an ethical point of view, luck can be defined as the moment of raising excellence or the moral achievements of the individual, that is, when the person has the moral character, plays the right cards and enacts successful strategies with the right decisions that taken at the right time, under the right conditions. Therefore, luck is the result of taking the right approach to life and often requires a lot of hard work and commitment to get ahead. Luck can also be seen as a reward for the efforts and determination of an individual. While luck may seem to favor some over others, it is ultimately the result of making the right choices and working hard to see them through. Therefore, luck can be seen as a positive result of ethical behavior.",
