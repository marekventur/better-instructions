  "output": "An example of a technology-enabled business model that could improve customer engagement is subscription-based models. Subscription based models allow companies to offer their services on a regular, recurring payment schedule. This allows customers to easily budget for their services and provides steadier long-term stream of revenue for the company. It also likely increases customer loyalty and reduces churn since customers have a reason to keep coming back. Additionally, with the data collected from these regular payments, companies can gain better insights into their customers' preferences and behavior. This can help them develop more targeted and personalized services or rewards to further engage their customers.",
