  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a clever mouse who was fascinated by cats. He spent hours watching them play and was eager to learn more about them. One day, he decided to go up to one and introduce himself. At first, the cat was startled, but after a few moments, the cat and mouse began to talk. The mouse asked the cat all sorts of questions, and the cat taught him all that he wanted to know. Before long, they had become fast friends. The mouse would visit the cat every day and the two would have wonderful adventures together.",
