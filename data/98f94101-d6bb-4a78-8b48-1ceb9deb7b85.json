  "output": "A hypothetical experiment could be conducted to determine the effects of financial incentives on the behavior of students. The dependent variable would be the amount of effort put forth by students on classroom tasks such as tests or assignments. The independent variable would be the availability of a financial incentive for completing the tasks. The experiment could involve two control groups, one of which would include the students receiving the financial incentive, and the other group consisting of students who would not receive the financial incentive. The results could then be compared to determine the effects of the financial incentive on student performance.",
