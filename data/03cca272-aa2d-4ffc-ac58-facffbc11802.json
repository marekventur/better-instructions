  "input": "",
  "output": "A mango has a sweet and juicy flavor. Its flesh is soft and creamy with a musky aroma that beckons you closer. There is a hint of tartness to the sweetness that provides its distinct flavor. When ripe, the mango has a chewy texture that some compare to a peach. The combination of sweetness, tartness, and the pleasant musky scent makes it a truly succulent and delightful experience.",
