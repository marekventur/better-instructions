  "output": "Here are three solution ideas to help solve the problem of global warming: \n\n1. Decrease the use of non-renewable energy sources. Efforts should be made to increase the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, instead of relying on non-renewable resources such as coal and oil. \n\n2. Reduce the burning of fossil fuels. Burning of fossil fuels releases Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to global warming. Decreasing the burning of fossil fuels will help reduce this issue.\n\n3. Plant more trees. Planting more trees helps to reduce the amount of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere as it is absorbed by the trees as part of photosynthesis. Furthermore, trees provide shade, reducing the absorption of heat by the surface of the Earth.",
