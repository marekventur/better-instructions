  "output": "The internet has had a profound impact on society. It has allowed people to access a wealth of information and resources, shop for goods and services, connect with each other in ways that weren't possible before, work remotely, and create new businesses and economic models. It has also increased access to education and enabled collaboration on global projects. At the same time, the internet has led to increased social isolation, cyberbullying, and data privacy concerns. It has also created new economic divides, as those with access to the internet and digital skills have benefited greatly from these new opportunities.",
