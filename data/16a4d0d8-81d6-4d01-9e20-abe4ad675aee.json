  "instruction": "Identify three causes of the given economic indicator.",
  "input": "High unemployment rate",
  "output": "Three causes of a high unemployment rate are a decrease in demand for goods and services, a decrease in wages and benefits, and a lack of available jobs. The decrease in demand for goods and services leads to layoffs, thereby increasing the number of unemployed people. Similarly, when wages and benefits are reduced it becomes more difficult for people to maintain employment. Finally, a lack of available jobs means that there aren\u2019t enough available positions for those who are seeking jobs.",
