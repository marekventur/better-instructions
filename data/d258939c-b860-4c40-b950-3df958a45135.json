  "input": "",
  "output": "One solution to prevent texting and driving is to use a hands-free device, such as a Bluetooth headset, that allows you to answer and make calls without needing to take your hands off the wheel. The device should also have a voice-activated texting feature that is able to convert voice commands into text. Additionally, laws should be put in place to make illegal use of cell phones and other electronic devices while driving.",
