  "output": "Mr. Higgins was an old and wise teacher who had seen and solved many puzzles in his long life. One day, he was presented with a peculiar maze that he couldn't solve, no matter how hard he tried. After days of trying, he gave up and returned to his notebook. In it, he had written notes about similar mazes he had seen in the past and he wondered if he could use this knowledge to find the solution to the current one. He thought about the various patterns, structures, and branching possibilities that the paths of a maze could take and slowly, the answer became clear. As he finished working out the structure of the maze, a bright smile grew on his face, he had successfully uncovered the solution!",
