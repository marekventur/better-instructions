  "output": "Creating a podcast involves a lot of planning. You will need to select a topic and format for your podcast, decide on a mix of audio, video and interactive elements, design a logo and artwork, plan an equipment setup and recording space, determine a schedule for producing and releasing episodes, and create a content calendar to keep track of ideas and topics. Additionally, you need to set up a website to host your podcast, choose a hosting platform to store audio files and generate RSS feeds, and receive and respond to feedback from listeners.",
