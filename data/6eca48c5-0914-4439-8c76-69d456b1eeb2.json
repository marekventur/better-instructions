  "instruction": "Describe a scenario in which the instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The instruction \u201cGo Outside\u201d can have different meanings based on context. For example, if someone is upset and their friend says to them, \u201cGo outside\u201d, it can mean to take a walk and get some fresh air to clear their head. On the other hand, if a parent says to their child, \u201cGo outside\u201d, it can mean go and play. In the first example, the instruction \u201cGo outside\u201d has a calming, therapeutic expectation, while in the second instance, the expectation is that the child should go and find some entertainment or amusement in their environment.",
