  "input": "",
  "output": "The key difference between mass media and direct communication is the level of interaction involved. Mass media typically involves a one-way transmission of information from a single source to multiple recipients, whereas direct communication involves two-way, interpersonal communication. Mass media is typically a broadcast method of communication, where the source of information is broadcasting a message to a large group of people; whereas direct communication is more targeted, allowing for a personal exchange between two or more people. Mass media is typically used to reach a wide variety of people, while direct communication is tailored to a specific individual or group of people.",
