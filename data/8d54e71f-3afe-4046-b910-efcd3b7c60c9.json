  "input": "",
  "output": "A conflict of interest would be a situation in which an individual stands to gain personally from making a decision that might not be in the best interest of the organization or group they represent. For example, if an individual is a consultant for a company and is also a shareholder of that same company, this could create a conflict of interest because they may give advice that serves their own interests rather than the interests of the company.",
