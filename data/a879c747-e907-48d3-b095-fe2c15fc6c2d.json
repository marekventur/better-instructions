  "input": "",
  "output": "Workplace bullying and harassment are both forms of workplace misconduct and both can have a negative impact on workplace morale, productivity and an employee\u2019s physical and mental health. The main difference between the two types of misconduct is the intent of the perpetrator. \n\nWorkplace bullying is generally defined as behavior that is intended to humiliate, intimidate or undermine an employee, while workplace harassment is behavior that is based on any protected characteristic such as age, race, gender, or sexual orientation, and that is intended to create a hostile or offensive work environment for the employee. \n\nBoth workplace bullying and harassment can have serious ramifications for employers, employees and the overall health of a workplace. It is important for employers to foster a workplace that is free of both bullying and harassment.",
