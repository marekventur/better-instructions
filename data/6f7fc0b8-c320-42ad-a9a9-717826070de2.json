  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce air pollution in urban areas is to switch to clean energy sources. This means transitioning away from fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, and toward renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. This can be done through installing solar panels, constructing wind turbines, or using biomass fuels. Additionally, reducing energy consumption through improving energy-efficiency in buildings can also help to reduce air pollution.",
