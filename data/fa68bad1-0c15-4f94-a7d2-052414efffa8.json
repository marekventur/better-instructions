  "instruction": "Given a piano piece, explain how the dynamics of the piece change throughout.",
  "input": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3rocGGTfmE",
  "output": "The piano piece begins with a gentle and delicate melody. The notes are softly played in a low dynamic. As the piece continues, the mixed dynamics become more prominent. The left hand plays a low, deep bass while the right hand plays a more powerful and melodic line. This increases in intensity towards the middle section as the dissonant chords ring out amidst the energetic piano playing. The end of the piece is a dramatic and passionate climax that is full of emotion. The rumbling bass and rising melody lead to a powerful and thrilling conclusion.",
