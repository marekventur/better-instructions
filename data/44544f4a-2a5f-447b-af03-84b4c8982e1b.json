  "output": "Ivan was always told to appreciate the home that he was fortunate to have and he did. Despite his family\u2019s cramped and crowded living space, he was grateful for their roof, the safety it afforded, and the warmth it provided. All too often, though, this sense of home was fleeting. The stress of balancing work and school weighed on his parents, as did the knowledge of their growing debt each month. Ivan and his siblings often found themselves having to move from one rental home to another and at times, even double-up with his extended family. With each change, he grew to understand the different shapes of home. \n\nOne winter, the family stumbled upon a place that seemed different from the rest. At first, Ivan feared that the cold would seep in to their home and chill them all to their bones, but the windows and walls made it clear that this was a home built by people with a plan. Despite his own uncertainties, Ivan\u2019s excitement and sense of home quickly returned as he explored the familiar rooms and unknown corners. He could look through the kitchen window and see a mountain range in the distance and in the evening, he could lay in the backyard and count stars for hours. Here he felt something he hadn\u2019t felt before. He didn\u2019t have to leave, he belonged.\n\nHis parents soon shared his joy, feeling the comfort and support that came from having a place to call home. Months after their discovery of this place and over the course of many little and big victories, they were able to make the monthly payments and the house became their own.\n\nIvan and his family had finally found a home that felt like home.",
