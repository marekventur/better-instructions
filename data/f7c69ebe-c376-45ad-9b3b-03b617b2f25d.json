  "input": "",
  "output": "Three immigration policies used in the USA are the DACA program, family-based immigration, and the immigration visa lottery. The DACA program provides temporary protection for certain undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as minors. Family-based immigration allows U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to sponsor certain close relatives for immigration. The immigration visa lottery makes 50,000 permanent visas available every year to applicants from nations with low immigration rates to the USA.",
