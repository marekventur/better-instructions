  "output": "A Notary Public is an important figure in the government as they are responsible for verifying documents relating to matters such as property, probate, and immigration. Notarization is a process where the Notary Public ensures that a document is authentic and valid and that the person in possession of the document is who they say they are. The Notary Public is held in high regard as they are entrusted with this responsibility as a representative of the government to make sure all documents meet the legal standards and that no fraud is taking place. As such, the important role of a Notary Public should not be ignored or taken lightly.",
