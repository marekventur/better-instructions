  "input": "",
  "output": "The phrase 'to make a beeline' means to move quickly and directly towards a destination, avoiding any distractions or delays. For example, if you were in a rush and needed to get to work as quickly as possible, you would make a beeline straight to your workplace. This phrase is derived from the supposed straight paths that bees take when flying back to their beehive.",
