  "input": "I am a student in college and I have a lot of classes this semester. I want to do well in all my classes but don't know how to manage my time between classes and studying.",
  "output": "An effective study schedule should include a balance of academic work, relaxation and social activities. Start by making a list of all the classes and assignments that need to be completed. Then, break these down into manageable tasks that will be completed each day or week. It's important to set realistic and achievable goals. Schedule adequate time to complete the tasks, and make sure to leave some time for relaxation and social activities. Develop a plan that allows for flexibility since some tasks may take longer or shorter than expected. Make sure to take breaks in between studying to help your brain relax and stay focused. Finally, starting each day with a \u201cto do\u201d list can help prioritize tasks. Having a regular study schedule can help keep you motivated and on track with your studies. Good luck!",
