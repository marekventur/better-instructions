  "instruction": "Create a book cover for a fiction novel.",
  "input": "Genre: Fantasy",
  "output": "I would create a book cover for a fantasy novel with a vibrant and dynamic design. I might include imagery of swords, dragons, castles, and of course a hero or heroine. The colors would be bold and contrasting, creating a sense of excitement and awe that draws the reader in. The title of the book should be prominently displayed, either in a creative font or as a fitting image. Overall, the design should be eye-catching and leave an impression on the reader.",
