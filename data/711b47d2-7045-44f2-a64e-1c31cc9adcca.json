She started off at the reptile exhibit, where she was mesmerized by the different kinds and sizes of snakes on display. She then moved on to the aviary, where she watched brightly colored birds soar through the air and sing beautiful tunes. \n\nNext, Samantha made her way to the mammals, where she was able to get up close and personal with the different animal species. She was in awe of the graceful lions and powerful elephants, and she even managed to pet a few of the friendly goats. After this, she made her way to the aquarium, where she was mesmerized by the bright colors of the fish and the beauty of the coral. \n\nFinally, the sun set and Samantha made her way back home, her head filled with incredible memories of the day and a newfound appreciation for animals and nature.",
