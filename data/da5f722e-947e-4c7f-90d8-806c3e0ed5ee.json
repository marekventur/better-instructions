  "output": "Newton's three laws of motion are laws that describe the relationship between an object's motion, mass, and acceleration. The first law states that an object will remain at rest or move in a straight line at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. The second law explains that the acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force acting upon it, and is inversely proportional to its mass. The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
