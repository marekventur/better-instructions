  "input": "",
  "output": "Having a home garden can provide many benefits, such as fresh produce, improved health and nutrition, increased physical activity, increased self-reliance, and a deeper connection with and appreciation for nature. Home gardening can also reduce your grocery bills by providing fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs for cooking, at a lower cost than buying them from a store. Lastly, home gardening can help conserve resources by reducing the need to buy species which may have a large environmental footprint if they were being grown and transported from distant places.",
