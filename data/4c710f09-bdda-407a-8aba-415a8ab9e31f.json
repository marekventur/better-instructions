  "output": "The main types of electromagnetic radiation include radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma-rays. The major difference between types of electromagnetic radiation lies in their frequency and wavelength. Radio waves have relatively long wavelengths and low frequencies, while gamma rays have short wavelengths and high frequencies. Each type of electromagnetic radiation also has unique applications and can interact with matter in different ways.",
