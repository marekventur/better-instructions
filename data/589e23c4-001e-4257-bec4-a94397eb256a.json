  "input": "Alternative energy sources are critical to solving the climate crisis",
  "output": "Alternative energy sources are absolutely vital in order to mitigate the most detrimental impacts of climate change. As the world transitions away from fossil fuels and towards more sustainable sources of energy, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, we can reduce the number of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and prevent further warming of our planet. Additionally, using renewable and alternative energies sources will create thousands of jobs and can help to create a healthy, stable economy. Investing in alternative energy sources is a sound decision and a necessary step if we want to effectively address the climate crisis.",
