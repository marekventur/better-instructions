  "input": "",
  "output": "A day in the life of an astronaut is filled with a variety of activities that range from medical assessments to launch preparations. Astronauts typically begin their day with physical exercise and a review of their daily tasks. Throughout the day they interact with mission control, run scientific experiments, and respond to maintenance requests. During free time they might take part in leisure activities or take part in extra-vehicular activity. On launch day astronauts usually wake up early in the morning and perform pre-launch checklists, review flight details, and are taken to the launchpad by a chartered bus. The hard work ends with launch, and the thrill of a successful launch is followed by a quiet journey back home.",
