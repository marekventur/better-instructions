  "input": "",
  "output": "The two methods of preventing reinforcement learning that come with significant risks and disadvantages are genetic algorithms and temporal difference (TD) learning. Genetic algorithms require a large number of trials and so consume a lot of resources. TD learning also requires many trials to evaluate the effectiveness of an action and may lead to exploration of bad moves that lead to poor performance.",
