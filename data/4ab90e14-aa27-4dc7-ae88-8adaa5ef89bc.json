  "input": "",
  "output": "Tokenization is the process of splitting a sentence into its individual words and punctuation marks. Stemming is the process of removing suffixes and prefixes to determine a word's root form. Lemmatization is the process of grouping together related words based on their meaning, so that a single term can represent different forms of a word. All these processes are used in natural language processing to reduce the number of words and effectively process natural language data.",
