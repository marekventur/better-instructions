  "output": "Artificial intelligence (AI) offers numerous advantages to businesses, such as improved decision-making, enhanced efficiency, better customer service, and increased cost savings. AI can analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately, enabling it to make decisions faster than a human ever could. This helps businesses avoid costly mistakes and discover useful data patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed. AI also helps businesses streamline processes and automate mundane tasks, giving human employees more time to focus on tasks that require more creativity and engagement. AI can also be used to develop more personalized customer experiences, with AI-powered chatbots and digital assistants providing 24/7 customer service and support. In addition, AI technology consumes less energy than manual processes, reducing overhead costs for businesses.",
