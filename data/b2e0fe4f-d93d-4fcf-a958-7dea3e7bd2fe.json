  "input": "I am stuck between two choices. I can either stay with my current job and get a stable income or leave the job and pursue my dream career.",
  "output": "It is understandable that this is a difficult decision to make. Consider your goals and values, and weigh both options based on which will bring you greater long-term satisfaction and fulfillment. You could also consider the potential costs of each option before making a decision. Talk to friends, family, or a professional to help see the situation in a different light. Ultimately, the decision is yours and no one can tell you which path to take.",
