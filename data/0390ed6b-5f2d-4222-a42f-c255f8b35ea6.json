  "input": "China\u2019s territorial expansion",
  "output": "China's territorial expansion is a major concern for the world community. It has caused tensions to mount between China and its maritime neighbours, such as Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan, as China seeks to gain control of key shipping lanes and islands in the South China Sea. It also heightens the risk of armed conflict in the region and leaves open the potential for the region to become a theater for geopolitical rivalries. Moreover, China's revisionist stance on its borders and expansive claims of sovereignty present a challenge to the international order and the rules-based system.",
