  "output": "Networking is an essential part of the job search process. It is essential for job seekers to get in contact with the right people and build relationships that could lead to job opportunities. Networking involves developing connections with people who are already in a certain field and learning how to negotiate and ask for help. It allows job seekers to gain valuable insight into the industry and gain access to insider information related to open positions. Moreover, networking allows job seekers to make personal connections with a potential employer, giving them an advantage over other applicants. Building a strong network of connections can be a great tool to unlock doors to job opportunities and make successful career transitions.",
