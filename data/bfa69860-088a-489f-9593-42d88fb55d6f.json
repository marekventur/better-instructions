I just felt like taking a nice, quiet walk in the park.\n\nAlice: That sounds lovely! I could use a break too.\n\n[A child comes running up to them.]\n\nChild: Hey! Can you help me find my mommy?\n\nAlice: Of course! What does she look like? \n\nChild: She has long, brown hair and she was wearing a blue dress.\n\nAlice: Let's go find her.\n\n[Alice and Bob search the park until they come across a woman wearing a blue dress.]\n\nBob: I think this is her!\n\n[The woman turns and embraces the child] \n\nChild: Mommy!\n\nWoman: Oh! Thank you two so much!\n\n[Alice and Bob smile and give a wave goodbye as the woman and child leave the park.] \n\nAlice: That was nice of us. \n\nBob: Sure was! Let's take that walk now.\n\n[Alice and Bob walk off into the park.]",
