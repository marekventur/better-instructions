  "input": "",
  "output": "My hypothesis is that the early stages of brain development are influenced by the environment and experiences in which a child is exposed to. This can include factors such as parental care, nutrition, physical activity, and access to educational opportunities. Through these experiences, the brain is shaped by the individual in a way that affects their cognitive abilities later in life.",
