  "input": "Term: Photosynthesis",
  "output": "Photosynthesis is a process by which plants convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy. In other words, photosynthesis is how plants make food for themselves. During photosynthesis, plants use light energy from the sun, carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the ground to create glucose and oxygen. These are then used for energy within the cells of the plant and for respiration.",
