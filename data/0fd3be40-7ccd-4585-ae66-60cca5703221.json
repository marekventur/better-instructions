  "output": "Alice woke up late one morning, dreading the days to come. She had lost track of time while studying the night before, and now she was in a rush to get to school on time. She quickly threw on her clothes and quickly grabbed her bag and ran to the bus. But to her dismay, the bus had already left with all the other students. She quickly made her way to school on foot, but it was already too late. She arrived late to school and was reprimanded by her teacher. However, she made sure that the same mistake won't happen again.",
