  "output": "The sun shone brightly in the sky as Alice stepped out of her house, into the garden. She had promised her mother that she would help pick apples to bake a tart, and she had been looking forward to this day all week. Off in the distance, she noticed a strange figure, an old man with a wooden cane and an apple hat, walking slowly in her direction.\n\nHe smiled when he reached her, and handed her a small, yellow stone with a gold star on it. He said it was magical, and it would bring Alice all the luck she needed. She thanked the old man, put the stone in her pocket, and went on to collect apples from the trees. \n\nAs she finished selecting all the apples, the sun began to set. She looked up and saw the stars twinkling in the sky. Suddenly, the old man's stone glowed in her pocket, and she saw the star shining brightly as it mirrored the stars in the night sky. Alice knew that, with the old man's luck, she would make the best tart in town.",
