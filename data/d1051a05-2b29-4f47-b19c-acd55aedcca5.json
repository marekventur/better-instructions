  "instruction": "Explain how Shingles is caused",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. When a person has had chickenpox in the past, the virus remains inactive in their nerve cells. In some cases, the virus can reactivate and cause shingles. The most common symptom of shingles is a painful rash, which usually appears on one side of the body or face. Other symptoms may include fever, headache, tiredness, and sensitivity to light. Treatment usually involves antiviral medications, pain relief medications, and topical creams.",
