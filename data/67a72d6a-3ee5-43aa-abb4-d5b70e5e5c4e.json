  "input": "Game of Thrones",
  "output": "The protagonist of Game of Thrones is the longsuffering and honorable Eddard \"Ned\" Stark. Ned is the head of an ancient and powerful house in the north of the Seven Kingdoms, but he is nothing like the scheming lords of the south. He is a man of incredible honor and integrity, a loyal friend and the driving force behind his family. Despite facing tremendous odds, Ned remains steadfast and determined in his duty to do what is right, even if it means great personal cost. In many ways, Ned serves as a moral compass for the show, and his sense of duty and justice serves as a contrast to the political machinations of the south.",
