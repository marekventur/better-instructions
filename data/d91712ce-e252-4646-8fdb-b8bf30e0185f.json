  "input": "",
  "output": "Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that stores data in a secure and immutable way. It is composed of \"blocks\", which are bundles of digital transactions that are digitally recorded and stored securely in a chain. By linking the blocks together, it prevents data from being altered or fraudulently manipulated. Its application to cryptocurrency is significant because it enables secure and decentralized transactions, with no central authority or intermediary such as banks required. It also increases the security of cryptocurrency transactions by using cryptographic principles like hash functions and digital signatures.",
