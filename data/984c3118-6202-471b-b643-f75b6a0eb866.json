  "output": "Deforestation has a range of environmental and health impacts. By cutting down large swaths of trees, deforestation can directly contribute to global warming and climate change by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by plants. It can also lead to increased erosion and flooding, as trees provide the necessary physical structure to stabilize a landscape. In addition, deforestation reduces the biodiversity of an area, removes habitats for animals, and reduces the availability of natural medicines, fruits and nuts. Deforestation can also lead to health problems such as air and water pollution, respiratory issues from smoke and dust, and weakened immune systems from exposure to toxins.",
