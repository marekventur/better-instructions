  "input": "",
  "output": "Geothermal energy production involves tapping into the heat generated from the earth's interior. This heat is extracted through various techniques, such as drilling for hot water, drilling for hot rocks, steam, and hot dry rocks. The heat is then used to create steam which is used to drive a turbine to generate electricity.",
