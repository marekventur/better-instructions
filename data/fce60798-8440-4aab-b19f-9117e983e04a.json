  "input": "\"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.\" - Nelson Mandela",
  "output": "This quote by Nelson Mandela speaks to the resilience, courage and determination of the human spirit. When faced with adversity and failure, it can be easy to succumb to defeat and feel helpless. This quote implores us to recognize that in the face of failure, there is glory to be found in simply getting back up and continuing forward, even better than before. Such rising ensures that we learn from our mistakes, grow in the face of adversity, and allows us to become the best, and most resilient, versions of ourselves. \n \nIn short, the greatest glory lies in resilience and never giving up, regardless of failure. This is a powerful reminder of the human capacity for rising above, no matter how hard or how far we have fallen. As Nelson Mandela famously noted, something special could be found even in falling, if it means that we can get up stronger.",
