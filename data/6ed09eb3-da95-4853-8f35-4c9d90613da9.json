  "output": "A dichotomous key is a type of graphic representation used to classify items by progressively narrowing down the choices using two-option questions. It typically contains two branches on either side of a decision node, with options and features marked on the branches. The user follows each branch of the dichotomous key until they reach a final conclusion. This is usually represented visually as a series of connected boxes and arrows.",
