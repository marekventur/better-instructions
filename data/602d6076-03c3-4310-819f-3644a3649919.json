  "output": "Joy is the buoyant feeling rising within, \nIt bubbles freely, lifting us ever higher; \nA enchantment of the soul that brings a divine grin, \nA glimpse into the vastness of summer fire. \n\nJoy fills us with a warmth and a surge of content, \nEmbracing us with the colors of life\u2019s playful hue; \nIt renews us with its unconditional sentiment, \nA gentle lullaby of rapture and gratitude. \n\nJoy uplifts us to an undulating plane \nThat shatters our darker moments into sweet respite; \nRadiating light, it liberates us from our pain, \nBringing us closer to a blessed insight. \n\nLet us embrace the joy that hovers above the clouds, \nEmitting the most tender of melodies, singing loud.",
