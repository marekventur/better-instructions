  "input": "",
  "output": "The voting process in the UK and US differ in a variety of ways. In the UK, citizens must be registered to vote, and the voting process consists of a two-step process. First, citizens vote on a paper ballot in a designated polling station. Second, the ballot is counted manually. In the US, voting is conducted on a precinct basis, and citizens must register prior to voting.  In some states, citizens may vote by mail or in person, depending on the state\u2019s laws, and voting is conducted using an electronic voting system. The votes are then tallied electronically and the winner declared.",
