  "input": "",
  "output": "The purpose of a unit testing strategy is to ensure the quality and accuracy of software by breaking it down into smaller units that can be tested for correct output. This is done through a process of automation that tests individual units against expected results, thereby identifying any potential errors in the software. Unit testing is a critical component of the development process, ensuring that the software is bug-free and capable of performing as intended.",
