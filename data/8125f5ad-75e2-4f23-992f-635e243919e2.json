  "output": "When it comes to computers, laptops and desktops have their own advantages and disadvantages. Laptops are more portable, making them ideal for business travelers, commuters, and students who need the flexibility to take their device with them wherever they go. However, they tend to be more expensive and have less power than desktops, making them less suitable for intensive gaming or multitasking applications. Desktops are bulkier, less portable, and typically more affordable, which makes them ideal for stationary gaming or media applications. They tend to have more power than laptops, and can be easily upgraded if more computing power is needed. Ultimately, each type of computer has its own unique set of uses, making it important to consider one's individual computing needs before making a purchase.",
