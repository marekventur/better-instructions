  "output": "As I wander through life's hillocks,\nSearching for an elusive meaning,\nMy thoughts drift aimlessly on the wind,\nYearning to find an answer I can cling.\n\nMy dreams can seem so far away,\nBut their answers are within me,\nA path of peace lies straight ahead,\nMy purpose is the one I seek.\n\nAs I journey further on my way,\nMy presence ever growing in power,\nI feel contentment rising in my soul,\nMy inner self finds my right bower.\n\nWhen my answers start to emerge,\nIt's time to find the way forward,\nMy heart unlocks and I can see,\nMy purpose is that of a different order.\n\nThe answer is the acceptance of me,\nAnd the gratitude of what I have,\nAcceptance and contentment so deep,\nMy search is over and my purpose is clear.",
