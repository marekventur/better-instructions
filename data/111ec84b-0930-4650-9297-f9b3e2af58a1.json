  "input": "",
  "output": "Both communism and capitalism are economic systems that are focused on the allocation of resources. Capitalism is based around the idea of a market economy, where individuals and firms make decisions about production and purchase based on prices and profit maximization. On the other hand, communism is based around the idea of a planned economy where resources are mainly allocated by the government. Both systems strive to regulate the economy and influence its growth, though they have starkly different methods.",
