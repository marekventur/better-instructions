  "input": "Tsunami: A huge wave caused by the displacement of a large body of water\nWildfire: Fire that burns large areas of land\nVolcano: An opening in the Earth's surface from which lava, ash, and gas can be released",
  "output": "A tsunami is a massive wave that's chaotic and sudden,\nAs it crashes, havoc and devastation are sure to come.\nA wildfire burns across the land with its devastating heat,\nLeaving a trail of destruction in its burning retreat.\nAnd a volcano below, a powerful force so strong,\nAn eruption of lava and ash, a relentless onslaught.\nThese natural disasters create a terror without compare,\nThey have the power to wreak havoc, leaving destruction everywhere.",
