  "input": "",
  "output": "Five examples of effective communication techniques include active listening, asking clarifying questions, using direct, non-judgmental language, giving feedback constructively, and using open-ended questions. Active listening allows a speaker to hear what someone is saying, comprehend it, and provide a response. Asking clarifying questions allows for a better understanding of a situation, as well as encourages a speaker to explain more in depth. Using direct, non-judgmental language ensures that everyone involved understands the terms being used clearly. Feedback should be given constructively, in order to encourage growth and understanding. Finally, open-ended questions give people the opportunity to provide a more detailed, in-depth answer.",
