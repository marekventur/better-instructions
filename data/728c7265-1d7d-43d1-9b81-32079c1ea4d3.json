  "input": "",
  "output": "Encouraging people to use more eco-friendly, sustainable substitutes, such as bamboo and biodegradable materials, is one way to reduce plastic waste in the environment. For example, replacing plastic straws with metal or paper straws and single-use plastic packaging with recycled paper or reusable cotton bags can help reduce plastic waste. Additionally, promoting the use of refillable containers and investing in more efficient recycling technologies can also help reduce plastic waste.",
