  "output": "Albert Einstein made many significant contributions to the field of physics. His most famous work is his theory of relativity, which provides a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space-time. He also developed the law of mass\u2013energy equivalence, E = mc2, which states that energy and mass are equivalent. Einstein proposed the photon theory of light and was the first person to explain the photoelectric effect. He also made important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory, and proposed the wave equation of quantum mechanics.",
