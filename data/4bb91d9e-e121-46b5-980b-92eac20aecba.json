  "output": "An example of an equation that could be used to solve a system of linear equations is Cramer's Rule, which can be written as x_i= det(A_i)/det(A), where A is the coefficient matrix of the system, A_i is a matrix obtained by replacing the ith column of A with the vector of the solution, and det(A) is the determinant of A.",
