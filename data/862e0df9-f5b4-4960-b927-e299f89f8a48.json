  "input": "",
  "output": "There are several tactics that can help someone stay motivated to reach their goals. First, break down the goal into achievable steps and set milestones to mark progress. This can help keep progress visible and demonstrate progress even when it might not feel like much is happening. Second, it's important to have a source of encouragement, whether it be from a close friend, family member, or knowledgeable mentor. Finally, it's important to remind yourself why the goal is important and how it can benefit the larger picture.",
