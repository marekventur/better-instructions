  "input": "",
  "output": "Blockchain technology can be used to reduce fraud in the banking industry by providing an immutable ledger of transactions that cannot be reversed or manipulated. It also has the potential to reduce the risk of data breaches, as the data stored on the blockchain is encrypted and decentralized, making it more difficult for hackers to access. Furthermore, blockchain's consensus mechanisms provide a secure way to verify and validate transactions, allowing for real-time detection of potential fraud.",
