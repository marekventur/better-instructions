Make sure to consider all possible options before deciding.\n4. Talk to someone you trust and whom you think might offer a helpful perspective on the decision.\n5. When faced with a difficult situation, choose the action you believe is right, regardless of personal consequences.\n6. When selecting between two options, ask yourself which one feels closest to what you want in the long-term.\n7. Respect the choices of others, even when they differ from your own.\n8. Always think before you speak or act.\n9. Remember that your decisions should reflect your values.",
