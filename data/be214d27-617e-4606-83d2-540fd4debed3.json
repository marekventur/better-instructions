  "output": "Dear [Sir/Madam],\n\nI am writing to express my frustration and disappointment with the job offer process. After careful consideration, I had accepted an offer for a job with [Company Name] on [date]. To my surprise, I was contacted a few days later to inform me that the position was no longer available.\n\nThis sudden change is highly distressing and totally unacceptable. I would like to point out that such a change of position should have been communicated to me before the offer was made to avoid this situation. This shows a lack of respect and consideration for an applicant's time and energy.\n\nI understand that everything may not always go as planned, however, your organisation should have been responsible and communicated the changed situation with me earlier.\n\nI hope that proper standards are maintained in the future and prospective applicants are treated with respect and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",
