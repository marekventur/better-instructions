  "output": "Blockchain technology is a distributed database that stores transactions across a peer-to-peer network. It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions and allows for the development of decentralized applications (dapps) on top of it. It is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that is immutable and has no single point of failure. The blockchain is maintained by a network of computers, or \u2018nodes\u2019, which are constantly verifying the chain and updating it with new data.",
