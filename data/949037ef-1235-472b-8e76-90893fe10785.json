  "input": "",
  "output": "Recent studies have shown that climate change is a growing problem, with worldwide implications. The effects of global warming are already being seen, with temperatures rising and more frequent and intense extreme weather events. Rising sea levels are threatening coastal areas, and drought and flooding are becoming more common. Additionally, the effects of climate change are having an impact on ocean health, resulting in rising acidity levels and decreases in biodiversity. Climate change is also having an impact on human health, particularly in poorer countries, where it often leads to food shortages, water scarcity and increased exposure to disease. It is therefore essential that governments and individuals work together to reduce emissions and tackle climate change.",
