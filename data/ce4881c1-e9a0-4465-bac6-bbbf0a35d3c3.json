Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and sear on each side until golden and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside. In the same skillet over medium-high heat, add 1/4 cup of dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of chicken broth. Simmer for about 5 minutes until the cranberries are tender. Return the chicken to the skillet and toss with the cranberries and garlic. Sprinkle with freshly chopped herbs for added flavor and serve with a side of your favorite vegetables.",
