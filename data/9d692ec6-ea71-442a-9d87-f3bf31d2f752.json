  "output": "When I was young, my grandparent used to tell me a story about a young girl named Susan. Susan was a brave and adventurous girl who lived in a small rural village in the United Kingdom. When she was only eight years old, her village was attacked by a dragon that had been living in a nearby cave. Everyone was in a panic and the village elders had no idea what to do. But Susan was determined to save her village. She got a knife from the kitchen and she bravely marched to the dragon\u2019s cave. She fought the dragon and killed it, saving the village from its destruction. To this day, the village celebrates her bravery and courage every year by holding a festival in her honour.",
