  "output": "Chess is played on a board with 64 squares arranged in an 8\u00d78 pattern. Each player starts the game with 16 pieces: one King, one Queen, two Rooks, two Bishops, two Knights, and eight Pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate or capture the opponent's King. In order to accomplish this, players must strategically move their pieces around the board, capturing pieces when they can and trying to protect their own.",
