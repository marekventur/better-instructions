  "input": "Online retailing\nBrick and mortar retailing",
  "output": "Online and brick and mortar retailing are two different types of retailing that contrast in many ways. With online retailing, customers are able to conveniently shop from the comfort of their home, often with free shipping options. On the other hand, brick and mortar retailing offers the benefit of a physical storefront, allowing customers to try products before buying and receive assistance and advice from in-store staff. Furthermore, customers may be able to find lower prices in a physical store, while online stores may require fees like shipping and handling.",
