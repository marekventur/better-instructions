  "output": "For a Halloween party, assemble an outfit that will make you stand out! Start with a base layer of black trousers and a white t-shirt. Then pair it with an eye-catching statement piece, such as a bright orange blazer. For shoes, choose something with a spooky vibe, like a pair of lace-up boots with gothic buckles. Accessorize with a deep red scarf and a black fedora. Finish off the look with a classic cane and a golden pocket watch.",
