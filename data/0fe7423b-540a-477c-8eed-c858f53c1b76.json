  "output": "When I was in middle school, I was working on a math project that required me to answer a set of questions related to the project. As I was trying to work my way through these questions, I encountered a particularly difficult one that I was unable to solve. After many hours of trying various approaches, I was eventually able to solve the problem through perseverance and determination. This experience taught me the value of persistence and not giving up even in the face of difficult tasks.",
