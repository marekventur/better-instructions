  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the most discussed topics in politics recently is the desirability of universal basic income (UBI). UBI is a proposed long-term economic system which provides all citizens of a country or region with a monthly stipend as a form of economic security and protection. Supporters argue that UBI would help individuals cover basic needs like food, housing, and medical care, while opponents worry about the potential costs to the government and argue that it could result in an increase of people choosing not to work.",
