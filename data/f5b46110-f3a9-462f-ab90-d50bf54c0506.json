  "output": "Hey there! It's been a while! \n\nI've been super busy lately, but it's all been fun! I took a trip to Hawaii with some friends and got to explore some amazing places. I took a lot of photos and enjoyed the peace and quiet. I've also been doing some volunteering at a local animal shelter, which has been great- it's so rewarding to help animals in need. I'm looking forward to the next few months, when I hope to take some time to relax and enjoy the summer. \n\nHope everything is going well with you!\n\nCheers,\n<name>",
