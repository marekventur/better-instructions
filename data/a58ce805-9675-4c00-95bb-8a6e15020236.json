  "instruction": "Compare and contrast conservatism and liberalism.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Conservatism is a political ideology that emphasizes traditional values, strength in national defense, and a limited role of the government in society. It advocates for an economy that is ruled by individuals, rather than the government, and leans toward a market economy. Liberals, on the other hand, advocate for an expanded role of the government in society. They are less likely to adhere to traditional values, advocating for civil rights and liberties, as well as a more progressive income tax system. In terms of the economy, liberals emphasize government intervention to promote fairness, justice, and equality. In summary, conservatism is marked by its emphasis on traditional values and limited government intervention, while liberalism emphasizes civil rights, liberties, and government intervention in the economy.",
