  "output": "Social media has had a profound impact on the current generation, changing the way people communicate, interact, and express themselves. It has created new opportunities for connecting with family, friends, and peers. It has also made it easier for people to share and access information quickly and widely. Social media can be used to find jobs, build networks, connect with customers, and cultivate a personal brand. Along with the many positive changes it has brought, social media have also given rise to an intense sense of competition, increased levels of cyberbullying, and the prevalence of health-related issues such as depression, sleep deprivation, and obesity.",
