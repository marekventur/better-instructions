  "input": "",
  "output": "The claim that fruits are not healthy snacks is incorrect. Fruits are a great source of essential nutrients and are full of dietary fiber, vitamin C, potassium, and other vitamins and minerals. Regularly eating fruits can reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and can even help improve overall mood and mental health. In addition, fruits are naturally low in sodium, cholesterol, and added sugar, making them an excellent choice for snacks.",
