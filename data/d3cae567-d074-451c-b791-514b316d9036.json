  "input": "",
  "output": "Tying a bow tie requires patience but is easy to accomplish. Firstly, the long end of the tie should be about 10-12 inches longer than the short end. The tie should then be crossed over and folded, forming an X shape. The longer end should then pass around the back, tuck behind the X, and the opposite end should be pulled down through the loop. After that, the loose ends should be tucked in under the bow and the bow should be pulled tight around the collar.",
