  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is broadly defined as the ability of a computer system to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings, such as problem-solving and learning from experience. AI can be used to improve capabilities in both hardware, such as robots and autonomous vehicles, and software, such as voice recognition and natural language processing. AI applications are increasingly being used for a wide variety of jobs, from manufacturing and healthcare to finance and military.  In general, AI seeks to automate tasks or processes normally performed by humans. It often requires considerable computing power and can involve deep learning, where AI systems are trained on large amounts of data.",
