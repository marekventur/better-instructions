  "input": "",
  "output": "Large data collection can help society understand, quantify, and predict various social, economic, and political outcomes. Manipulation of large datasets can lead to new insights, often very quickly. For example, in healthcare, data analysis of large amounts of data can support the early detection of diseases and provide a more personalized approach to treatment. Businesses use data to make decisions about pricing, marketing, and distribution strategies, among other factors. In terms of public policy, data can be used to inform policies and better target resources within communities and across governmental units. Finally, large data collection can help to identify and tackle social issues, and help society become more efficient and equitable.",
