  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between artificial intelligence and natural language processing is that artificial intelligence is the broader discipline that focuses on creating intelligent machines, while natural language processing is the specific field of AI that is concerned with the ability of machines to understand and generate human language. Artificial intelligence encompasses the development of algorithms that allow machines to learn, while natural language processing applies these algorithms towards language understanding and generation tasks.",
