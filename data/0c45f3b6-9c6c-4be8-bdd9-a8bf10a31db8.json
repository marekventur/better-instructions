  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the benefits of using solar energy versus using fossil fuels.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Solar energy is an increasingly popular form of renewable energy as it is clean, efficient, and abundant. Solar energy produces zero emissions and does not contribute to global warming or pollute the environment. In contrast, fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy and when burned, release vastly more air pollution and hazardous byproducts. Notably, the combustion of fossil fuels is a major contributor to global warming.",
