  "output": "There are several different types of meditation, each with its own unique benefits. Mindfulness meditation focuses on living in the present moment, with non-judgmental awareness of thoughts and feelings. Guided meditation is a technique that combines mindful concentration with calming visuals and suggestions. Transcendental meditation encourages the use of a mantra or phrase to move into a peaceful and relaxed state. Heart-centered meditation is a practice of connecting to your inner essence through focusing on the breath and the heart. Lastly, there is aromatherapy meditation, which combines the healing power of essential oils with relaxationtechniques.",
