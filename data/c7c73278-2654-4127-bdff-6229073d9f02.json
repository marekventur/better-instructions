  "input": "No input.",
  "output": "A use case of machine learning in a healthcare system would be to employ predictive analytics in order to anticipate and preempt the onset of diseases. Through the use of machine learning, healthcare systems can incorporate data from medical history, lab test results, and patient lifestyle to develop algorithms that accurately detect the onset of diseases or health complications. In this way, doctors are able to provide more personalized and proactive care to patients, leading to better patient outcomes.",
