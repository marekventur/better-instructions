  "output": "I recently visited the beach. The ocean had a beautiful blue hue, and the sand felt warm beneath my feet. I stood at the shore, mesmerized by the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks. The smell of salt in the air reminded me of summer time. The sun was setting, casting an orange glow across the horizon.  It was one of the most beautiful sights I ever saw.",
