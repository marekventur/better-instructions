  "output": "Air and water are two essential elements for sustaining life. They both provide a regular medium for traveling, exchanging, and transporting energy, although air primarily utilizes air currents while water utilizes waves and tides. Air is composed mostly of nitrogen and oxygen while water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Air is a gas while water is a liquid. Furthermore, air is not flammable while water can be used to put out a fire.",
