  "output": "Animal Farm is a satirical novella by George Orwell that uses animals on a farm to represent political figures and ideologies of the Soviet Union during the Russian Revolution. The majority of the animals on the farm, led by the pigs, overthrow their human caretaker, Mr. Jones, in a quest for freedom and equality. Soon after, the pigs establish a set of Seven Commandments of Animalism, which serve as the rules of the farm. The pigs gradually manipulate the other animals into following the commandments, which concentrate power and privileges to them alone. As the animals become more oppressed and the pigs gain more power, the commandments become more twisted and the once-equal society devolves into a totalitarian state under the leadership of the pig, Napoleon. Eventually, the other animals on the farm realize the pigs\u2019 deception and revolt, saying \u201cfour legs good, two legs bad\u201d and restoring the rule of the farm to the animals.",
