  "output": "Friends are like a lighthouse in a storm, \nGiving guidance and guiding home.\nThey are like a rainbow in the sky,\nBrighter than the stars and making us fly.\n\nFriends are like a warm hug on a cold day,\nHolding us tight and never fading away.\nThey are like a shelter from the rain,\nProtecting us from all the pain.\n\nFriends are like a bouquet of flowers,\nFilling us with joy for all our hours.\nThey are like a melody of song,\nSoulful and soothing all day long.",
