  "output": "Punctuated equilibrium is a theory developed in the '70s which suggests that species evolve in short bursts of rapid changes and then over long periods of time, the species will remain relatively stable. This would be followed by another short burst of sudden change and then another period of stability. This theory states that the long periods of stability are the result of the equilibrium being created between two opposing forces of genotypic and phenotypic variation. This explains the absence of intermediate forms in the fossil record, as the large adjustments observed over time occur in relatively short bursts followed by far longer periods without change.",
