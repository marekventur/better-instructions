  "output": "Scanning documents with your phone is a simple process. First, open the camera app on your phone. Then, lay the document you wish to scan on a flat surface. Position your phone so that the document fits fully within the frame on your phone's screen. The app will take the picture, which you can review to make sure it's proper. After that, the app will convert the picture into a PDF file stored on your phone.",
