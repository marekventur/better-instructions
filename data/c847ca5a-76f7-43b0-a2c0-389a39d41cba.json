  "output": "John was a delivery driver in a large city. His job was to deliver packages all over the city, but sometimes he got lost. Today was one of those days; he had already wasted an hour just trying to find his way through the streets. He must have been particularly unlucky, since the directions were pretty clear. But since he was already late, he had no choice but to keep driving until suddenly, he found his way out of this seemingly never-ending maze of confusing alleys.",
