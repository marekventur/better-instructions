  "instruction": "Create a new implementation plan to reduce the price of transportation across the United States.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An implementation plan to reduce the price of transportation across the United States should include the following measures. First, the federal government should actively support public transportation initiatives and provide financial incentives for public transit systems. Second, the government should invest in developing more efficient vehicles and alternate energy sources such as electric or hybrid vehicles. Third, private auto companies should be encouraged to implement incentives for purchasing fuel efficient vehicles or vehicles powered by alternate energy sources. Fourth, states should be encouraged to provide transportation subsidies for lower income individuals in order to make transportation more affordable for everyone. Lastly, government agencies should partner with private companies to develop and implement a comprehensive plan for improved traffic congestion management and better infrastructure design. These measures should reduce the cost of transportation and increase access for all.",
