They can be accessed from anywhere, anytime, meaning students no longer have to be physically present in a classroom to gain knowledge. Similarly, interactive websites, apps and tutorials can make language learning a more engaging experience. Technology can also increase the effectiveness and efficiency of assessments, by allowing teachers to track student progress, set goals and quickly identify areas of improvement. Technology can even be used to improve collaborative learning by connecting learners with experts and resources from around the world.",
