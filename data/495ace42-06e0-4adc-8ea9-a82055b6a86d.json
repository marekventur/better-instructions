  "output": "France and Germany both operate with strong democracies and share a political love for the European Union. France is a unitary republic, operating on a centralized government system with a strong presidential system. Germany operates with a federal government, involving several layers of government with larger government powers coming from the federal level. France also has a less strict immigration policy than Germany, allowing for more lenient policies when it comes to rights to residency and work.",
