  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a young boy named John who was walking down a long hallway. As he walked, he noticed a red apple on the floor. He had seen many apples like this out in the streets, but this one was special. He stooped down and picked it up. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise coming from the other end of the hallway. He looked up and saw a giant truck driving towards him. John froze, and the apple in his hands became his source of courage. He ran in the opposite direction, never looking back. This apple, he thought, had given him luck.",
