  "output": "Machine Learning is the subfield of Artificial Intelligence that deals with the development of algorithms that can learn from large datasets. It is based on the idea of predictive modeling, where a machine is trained to recognize patterns in data and to make predictions about new, unseen data. Machine Learning algorithms are used to automate tasks and make decisions, and they can continually improve with more data and experience.",
