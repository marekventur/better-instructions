  "input": "",
  "output": "Economic specialization is a concept that involves focusing on one particular industry or specific economic activities. This strategy can be beneficial for an economy because it increases efficiency. By specializing, workers are able to develop skills in a particular field, allowing them to produce goods and services at a lower cost than if they were doing general labor. Specialization also allows economies to specialize in producing goods and services that they are most productive at, allowing them to buy other goods and services that they are not as good at producing. This helps create a balance of trade, and allows economies to generate more wealth by producing goods and services that are in demand.",
