  "input": "",
  "output": "Pigs and cows are both animals, but they have many differences. Pigs are omnivores, while cows are herbivores, meaning that cows primarily eat grass and other plant matter while pigs can eat both plants and animals. Pigs have cloven hooves, while cows have hooves that are divided in two sections. Pigs are more likely to be raised as pets, while cows are typically reared for their meat, milk, and other products. Pigs also tend to be smaller than cows, and they have more hair than cows.",
