It allows team members to stay on the same page, ensuring that tasks are completed accurately and in a timely manner. Communication also enables project managers to stay aware of potential issues, providing the opportunity to address any issues before they become major problems. By being open and keeping everyone up to date, project managers can ensure their team is running efficiently and that their team can resolve any problems before they arise.",
