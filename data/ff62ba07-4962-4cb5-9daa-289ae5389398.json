  "instruction": "How does gravity affect the motion of an object?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Gravity affects the motion of an object by attracting it toward other objects with more mass. This causes objects to accelerate as they move closer to the objects with more mass. The magnitude of the gravitational force between two objects depends on their respective masses and the distance between them. As objects move away from each other, the gravitational attraction decreases and their velocity slowly begins to decrease.",
