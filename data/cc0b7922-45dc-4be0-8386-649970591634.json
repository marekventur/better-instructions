  "input": "",
  "output": "Computer scientists can use their skill and knowledge of programming and data analysis to create models and simulations that can help accurately predict and track the impact of climate change over time. They can develop algorithms to identify the optimal strategies for reducing emissions, conserving energy and resources, and promoting sustainable development and infrastructure. They can also use their expertise to develop systems and applications to monitor energy use, reduce waste, and better manage environmental resources.",
