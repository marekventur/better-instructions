  "input": "",
  "output": "A beach typically features a wide sandy or pebbly shoreline, with various shades of blue water extending out to the horizon. There are usually rolling hills of sand dunes nearby, as well as driftwood and other coastal features. Depending on the location, there may be a variety of vegetation growing, from palm trees to seagrass. Seagulls and other seabirds can usually be seen soaring above the beach, while the sound of waves crashing onto the shore is a distinct sign that you're at the beach.",
