  "instruction": "Explain why television ads may not be effective for all candidates.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Television ads may not be effective for all candidates since some may already have widespread name recognition and will not benefit as much from television advertisement. Additionally, if a candidate has limited funds, they may not be able to invest in television advertising or produce ads of high enough quality to be effective. The sheer volume of ads can also make it difficult for individual ads to stand out.",
