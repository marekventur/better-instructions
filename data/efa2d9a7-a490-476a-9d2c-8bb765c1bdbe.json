  "input": "",
  "output": "The advantages of an artificial neural network in terms of scalability include its ability to adapt to increasing complexity, its resilience to failure and its flexible architecture. The number of layers and neurons within a neural network are usually quite large and can be scaled up or down, depending on the scope of the problem. However, immense scalability also leads to massive computational costs, which can be a disadvantage. Additionally, the number of parameters involved in training a neural network is traditionally very large, making it difficult to adjust these weights in an optimized manner.",
