  "instruction": "Describe how a pressure cooker works",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A pressure cooker is a sealed pot with a valve that can be used to raise the internal pressure. This allows the water or food inside to be cooked at a much higher temperature than usual, enabling the food to cook faster while retaining more moisture. When the pressure inside the cooker is released, the cooked food can be easily removed.",
