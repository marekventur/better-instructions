  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a bear who lived in the deep woods. The bear was a very curious creature, and enjoyed exploring the world around him. One day, the bear stumbled upon a small pond, and while looking in the water, he saw a reflection of himself. Startled, the bear ran away, but the next day he came back. He slowly began to get used to seeing his reflection, and eventually stopped running away. In time, the bear and his reflection made a pact, and the bear learned many things from the reflection. The bear and the reflection remained good friends until the bear died many years later.",
