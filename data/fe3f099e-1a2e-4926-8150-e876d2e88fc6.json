  "output": "Brexit is the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and the events leading up to it have had a lasting effect on British society. Since the UK voted to leave in June 2016, the country has undergone a period of turmoil and uncertainty. This article will provide a summary of the changes that Brexit has ushered in for Britain. \n\nOne of the most prominent effects of Brexit has been the political upheaval it has brought. The referendum in 2016 was won on the Leave side by a slim majority, resulting in the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron. The election that followed brought the Conservative Party to power under Theresa May and negotiations regarding Brexit began. In the period leading up to the UK\u2019s official exit from the EU, multiple extensions were requested and granted, while no agreement between the negotiating parties was reached. \n\nThe economy has seen significant change since the Brexit vote. While the UK economy has grown consistently since the referendum, the rate at which it has grown has significantly declined. The value of the British pound has dropped and this has had a negative impact on imports. Additionally, the Bank of England\u2019s decision to raise interest rates has made borrowing more expensive and this has affected consumer spending. \n\nThe customs union, which binds countries in the EU, will be dissolved as the UK exits. This means that the UK will be able to make its own trade deals with countries outside the EU and will no longer be subject to the free movement of persons throughout the union. This could have further implications for the economy, as the UK will be unable to access the same resources and skills from within the EU.\n\nBrexit has also had a social and cultural impact. Immigration from the EU has decreased since 2016 and, as the UK seeks to make its own trade deals with other countries, the face of immigration into the UK is likely to change. Additionally, the UK\u2019s departure from the EU could lead to a change in the culture and identity of the country, as British people distance themselves from continental European culture and redefine themselves as independent and separate from the rest of Europe. \n\nTo summarise, Brexit has brought with it a number of changes, both positive and negative, and the full impact of these changes will only become clear in the coming years. The UK\u2019s economic and political trajectory, in addition to the impact on its culture and identity, will be assessed and will shape the nation\u2019s future.",
