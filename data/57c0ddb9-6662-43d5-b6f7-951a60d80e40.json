  "output": "Verse 1:\nI been hustlin' all week, Tryin' to make a dollar out of dimes \nJust tryin' to get by, Get to see another side \nI'm getting closer, but it's still so far away \nGotta keep going, got no room for delay \nTakin' all shots regardless, don't care if I miss \nYou might fool some, but you can't fool me, no way, no how \n\nChorus:\nTime keeps moving, won't wait for __fill in the blank__ \nGonna make it happen, don't care how \nGotta stay focused, never show no doubt \nCuz I know that I'm never going without \n\nVerse 2:\nBlessings start to come, Giving thanks for the little things \nPut on my best foot forward, Step up when I hear the call \nMovin' on up, there's no stoppin' my flow \nMy hustle don't ever stop, 'til I make it all the way to the top \nGonna keep pushing and never let go \nYou can come with me or stay in the bottom and watch me glow \n\nChorus:\nTime keeps moving, won't wait for __fill in the blank__ \nGonna make it happen, don't care how \nGotta stay focused, never show no doubt \nCuz I know that I'm never going without \n\nOutro:\nGonna keep running, ain't stoppin' for anything \nGonna go as hard as I can, never gonna let it go \nGonna keep hustling, and make sure I reach my goals \nGonna stand up tall and show no fear \nGonna go for it, no matter what the odds may be.",
