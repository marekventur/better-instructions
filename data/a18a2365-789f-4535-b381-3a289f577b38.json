  "input": "x: 1, 2, 3, 4\ny: 6, 5, 7, 8",
  "output": "The regression coefficient (r) can be calculated using the formula r = (\u03a3xy - (\u03a3x)(\u03a3y)/n)/\u03c3x\u03c3y, where \u03a3xy is the sum of the products of x and y, (\u03a3x)(\u03a3y)/n is the product of the sums of x and y divided by the sample size, and \u03c3x\u03c3y is the product of the standard deviations of x and y. \nIn this problem, the regression coefficient (r) is 0.8.",
