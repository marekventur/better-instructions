  "output": "The impact of traffic pollution on health is significant. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is estimated to cause 3.7 million premature deaths a year, largely due to diesel exhaust from air pollution and fine particulate matter. Exposure to air pollution has been linked to the development of serious respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, including asthma, lung cancer, strokes, and coronary heart diseases. Additionally, research has found that high levels of nitrogen dioxide, which comes from vehicle exhaust, can cause damage to the nervous system, as well as increase the risks of type 2 diabetes and psychological stress.",
