  "output": "A basic network configuration consists of two or more computers connected in a chain, with each computer connected to the next. Data travels between the computers in the form of packets, which are routed with some form of addressing technology. The network can be configured to allow multiple devices or users to share resources such as files or printers. Additionally, various other technologies and components may be used to manage and secure the network, such as switches, routers, firewalls, and antivirus programs.",
