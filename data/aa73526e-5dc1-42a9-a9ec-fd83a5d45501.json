  "output": "Good afternoon everyone. Today, I'd like to address the pressing concern of environmental pollution. Environmental pollution is a global problem that has been escalating for decades and is causing irreversible damage to the planet. Air, water, land, and noise pollution are some of the major forms of pollution that affect our environment, and in turn, harm human health and well-being. We need to take action to address this issue and make fundamental changes in the way we obtain and utilize energy, handle waste, and dispose of pollutants. We must also change our consumptive behavior and think more sustainably on a global scale. Thank you.",
