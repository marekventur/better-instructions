  "input": "",
  "output": "The purpose of iterative deepening in a depth-first search algorithm is to find optimal solutions in cases where the search space is too large to search in its entirety. It works by performing a depth-limited search, starting with a shallow depth level and slowly increasing the depth level until a solution is found. This process is repeated until the search space has been completely explored. Iterative deepening is an efficient way of performing depth-first search, as it ensures that no possible solution is left unexplored.",
