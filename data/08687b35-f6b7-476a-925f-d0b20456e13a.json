  "input": "",
  "output": "In order to set up a web server, you will need a server operating system, a web server software, a database management system, a scripting language, and a web design tool. The server operating system, such as Linux or Windows Server, provides the platform to run the web server software. The web server software, such as Apache or IIS, manages all the requests and responses. The database management system stores the data and manages the queries. The scripting language, such as JavaScript or PHP, handles the data processing and application logic. Finally, the web design tool, such as HTML or CSS, creates the web page display.",
