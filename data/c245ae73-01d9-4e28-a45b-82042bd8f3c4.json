  "instruction": "Design a room that follows the given style.",
  "input": "Vintage style.",
  "output": "The vintage style room would include furniture and d\u00e9cor with a shabby chic look, featuring muted colors and distressed pieces. A statement wall could also be added with a wallpaper featuring a flowery pattern. To give the room an eclectic feel, a mix of furniture from different eras could be used. For example, a mid-century modern chair or armchair with an ornate Edwardian dresser. Vintage-style lighting fixtures, like ceiling-mounted pendants or wall sconces, could add a warm, inviting atmosphere while layered rugs in earthy tones and faded florals can make the space feel homey.",
