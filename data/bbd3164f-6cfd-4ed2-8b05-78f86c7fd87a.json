  "input": "",
  "output": "During President Trump's time in office, the US has taken a largely hands off approach to tackling climate change. The administration has sought to rollback Obama-era climate regulations and policies designed to cut emissions, and the President has denied the link between human activities and climate change. Most recently, the Trump administration has proposed a rule that would weaken Obama-era auto efficiency standards and has moved to repeal the Clean Power Plan.",
