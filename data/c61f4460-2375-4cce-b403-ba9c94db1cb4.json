  "input": "",
  "output": "The typical city street scene is a flurry of activity. People of all ages and backgrounds are rushing from place to place, their faces illuminated by pocket screens, their strides swift and purposeful. Horns blare in the distance, and on occasion, the rumble of a bus or the screech of a train car echo through the air. Street vendors add a bustling hum to the air, hawking their wares to pedestrians and taxis alike. Street performers in costumes, playing instruments or performing acts, draw curious crowds. A cacophony of smells from nearby restaurants lingers in the air as the sun sets on the city's chaotic streets.",
