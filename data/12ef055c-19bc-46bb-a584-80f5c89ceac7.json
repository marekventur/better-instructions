  "output": "The snow glistens in the fading sunlight,\nReminiscent of a peaceful night,\nThe bunny hops through the deep snow,\nSecure in nature's gentle flow. \nThe trees sway in the cold winter breeze,\nWhite snow cascading from the highest trees,\nThe fox ducks through the snow white dew,\nThe sky a brilliant sight of blue,\nCoated with a tinge of golden yellow,\nA reminder of love so mellow.",
