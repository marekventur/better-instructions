  "input": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field that seeks to mimic or augment human capabilities through information processing technology and algorithms. AI has been an area of study since the 1950s, but has gained popular attention in recent years due to vast improvements in processing power. While some fear existential threats such as a Terminator-like hypothetical AI takeover, most of the practical applications of AI are in mundane areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and task automation. AI is used to improve or automate mundane tasks, quickly identify patterns, and predict future events.",
  "output": "AI is a field of study that aims to replicate or enhance human abilities through technology. Its applications are mostly mundane and revolve around task automation, pattern recognition and prediction of future events. However, there is a fear of possible existential threats due to its increasing capabilities.",
