  "instruction": "Explain the concept of Mutual Exclusivity",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Mutual Exclusivity is a cognitive principle that states that objects belong to one specific category and cannot be part of another. This principle can help children better understand language, as they learn to quickly categorize items into groups, rather than attempting to assign a single object to multiple categories. For example, when a child is presented with a tiger, they recognize that it belongs to the group of animals, and cannot belong to the group of cars.",
