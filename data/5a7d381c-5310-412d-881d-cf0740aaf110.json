  "instruction": "Imagine a situation and write a paragraph of how to solve it.",
  "input": "You arrive at a party and you know nobody.",
  "output": "Upon arriving at the party, I immediately tried to put myself in a comfortable setting by scouting the area for familiar faces or conversation starters. I also took some deep breaths, put on a smile, and even made a few small jokes. Whenever I successfully engaged in a conversation, I asked meaningful questions that allowed me to learn more about the people around me. As time passed and conversations started to become more natural, I eventually made a few new acquaintances.",
