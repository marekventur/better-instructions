  "output": "To teach a toddler the alphabet, start with the ABC song. Sing the song together and invite them to clap along with the rhythm. Then, introduce each letter of the alphabet one at a time. Show the child examples of things that start with each letter and have them repeat the sound each letter makes. Play games that use the alphabet, such as letter hunts around the house or memory games to help them remember the letters.",
