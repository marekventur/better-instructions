  "input": "",
  "output": "The sun is different from other stars because it is much closer to us than other stars. It is also much brighter and more massive than other stars. It is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, while other stars are composed of many different elements. Additionally, the sun has tremendous gravitational power, which pushes away the gas and dust around it, thereby protecting nearby planets from having their atmospheres stripped away by radiation.",
