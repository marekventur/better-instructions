  "instruction": "Describe how a computer and a smartphone are different.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Computers (desktop and laptop) and smartphones are both computers, but they differ in several ways. Computers tend to be larger and bulkier and require regular maintenance. They also require more power than a smartphone and typically have more energy-consuming components such as multiple fans and larger processors. They are also able to run more powerful programs and support more complex tasks such as playing video games. Smartphones are more compact and lightweight and provide greater portability for users. They tend to have fewer energy-consuming components such as processors, and instead rely more on software, making them less power-hungry. They are generally limited in terms of their processing power, making them better suited to more simple tasks such as web browsing. Additionally, many modern smartphones come with touchscreens and other built-in sensors as well as internet and data connections, giving them a range of capabilities that computers cannot currently match.",
