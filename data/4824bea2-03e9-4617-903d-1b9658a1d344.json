  "output": "Computer networks rely on a combination of hardware, software, and protocols to exchange information over a network. The hardware contains the physical components used for communication such as routers, hubs, and cables. The software consists of the protocols and algorithms used for communication such as TCP/IP. These two components interact to enable communication across devices over the network.",
