  "instruction": "Write a classification algorithm for recognizing handwritten digits.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A classification algorithm for recognizing handwritten digits should be based on supervised machine learning. The algorithm should use a training dataset of handwritten digits, with labels associated with each image, and a test dataset of handwritten digits without labels. The algorithm should use a classifier to learn the features and patterns of the training data and predict the labels of the test data. The features could include overall shape, size, orientation, black/white ratio, and the presence of lines, curves, and other features.",
