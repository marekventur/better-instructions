  "input": "",
  "output": "Quantum computing is a new form of computing technology that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to store and process information. Unlike traditional computing, the small, subatomic particles that make up the quantum realm can exist in multiple states at the same time. This phenomenon of quantum superposition allows quantum computers to operate on multiple data points simultaneously, resulting in faster processing speeds and higher computational power. Additionally, quantum computing can also utilize entanglement, which allows for data to be sent across long distances almost instantaneously.",
