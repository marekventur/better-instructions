  "input": "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm",
  "output": "KNN can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as pattern recognition, classification, and regression. For example, it could be used for predicting the prices of houses in a given area by looking at their characteristics and neighboring house prices. The algorithm will measure the similarity between each house and its nearest neighbors and will assign it a price based on their similarity. This is a common way of using KNN to solve a regression problem.",
