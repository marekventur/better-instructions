  "output": "The stars shone brightly in the night sky, a reminder of the mysterious and wondrous creatures that lived in the deepest, darkest places of the forest. The kids all knew the stories of the magical creatures, but they would never venture into the woods alone, not with their imaginations running wild. \nHowever, one brave boy did venture into the forest, hoping to find one of those magical creatures. He was not disappointed. He stumbled across a small clearing, and there, glittering in the moonlight, was a bright, beautiful creature with wings like stars\u2014the Celestial Dragon. The boy was captivated by its beauty and grace, and the two soon became fast friends.\n\nThe Celestial Dragon had the power to grant wishes, so the boy took this opportunity to make his greatest wish come true. He asked the dragon to grant him the gift of flight, and the dragon granted his wish by allowing him to ride on its back. From then on, whenever the stars shone brightly, the boy could be seen soaring through the night sky on the back of his magical friend.",
