  "input": "",
  "output": "Modal dialogs are pop-up windows that open and close independently of any other window, while non-modal dialog boxes appear within a single window and must be completed before other actions can take place in the application. Modal dialogs, also known as modal windows, are typically used to provide time-sensitive information or other important notifications and often have some type of \"OK\" or \"Cancel\" button to proceed and close the dialog. Non-modal dialogs are used to provide the user with extra information that is not vital to the completion of the task, such as a video tutorial, an on-screen map, or even additional settings. Additionally, non-modal dialogs can remain open and can be interacted with after other actions in the application have taken place.",
