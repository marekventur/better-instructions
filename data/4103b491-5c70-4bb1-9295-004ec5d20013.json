  "output": "Technology has drastically improved communication on both a local and global level. It has made it much easier to connect and stay in touch with people from around the world, through the use of email, instant messaging, video conferencing, and social media platforms. Technology has also made it easier for individuals to receive up-to-date information about topics of interest, further strengthening communication. Increased web access has also improved communication by providing a forum in which people can share ideas and collaborate on projects, regardless of geographical distance.",
