  "instruction": "Indicate how the following characters in the novel reflect the theme of \"the corrupting influence of power\".",
  "input": "Gregoire in Zola's Germinal",
  "output": "Gregoire serves as an example of the corrupting influence of power in the novel Germinal. As the only one of the miners who rises to the upper echelons of the mining company, Gregoire turns his back on his former comrades in favor of promoting his own interests. He changes from being a loyal and kind miner to a callous overseer who takes joy in crushing the miners' spirit and punishing them for the smallest of offenses. His transformation is a stark illustration of how those corrupted by power have the capacity to be so much more heartless and ruthless than before, and his journey encapsulates the theme of \"the corrupting influence of power\".",
