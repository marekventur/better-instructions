  "instruction": "How is a liquid chromatography differs from gas chromatography?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Liquid chromatography and gas chromatography are both techniques used to separate compounds in a sample. The main difference between them is the type of mobile phase employed. In liquid chromatography, the mobile phase is a liquid and components of the mixture to be separated are dissolved in the liquid, while in gas chromatography the mobile phase is a gas. Additionally, liquid chromatography has smaller particles so it can retain more components than gas chromatography.",
