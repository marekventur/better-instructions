  "input": "",
  "output": "The user-centered design process consists of five stages: research and analysis, conceptual design, prototyping, user testing, and iteration. The research and analysis stage involves gathering data about users and the problem space, understanding user needs and wants, and developing an understanding of the user-system interaction. The conceptual design stage involves sketching out logical user interface design ideas, creating low-fidelity prototypes, and making design decisions. The prototyping stage is when high-fidelity visuals are developed. The user testing stage is when a prototype is tested by users to evaluate design decisions. Lastly, the iteration stage is when results from user testing are used to refine and improve the design.",
