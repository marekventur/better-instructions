  "output": "A game of chance, sometimes known as a lottery, is a game in which the outcome depends entirely on luck. Players must make decisions or take actions, but the results of these decisions or actions do not determine the outcome. Instead, the outcome is determined by the randomness of fate. Examples of games of chance include card games like poker, dice games like craps, and roulette.",
