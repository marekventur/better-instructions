Democracy is a form of government wherein the citizens have control and represented by elected officials, while totalitarianism refers to a government wherein a single leader or party has complete and unlimited power over the people. In a democracy, there is a system of checks and balances and citizens have rights, while in a totalitarian regime, the leader or party has absolute power and citizens have no rights.",
