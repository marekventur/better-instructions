  "input": "",
  "output": "In the forest, a single tree stands tall amongst the others. The leaves on its branches are a brilliant array of oranges, reds, and yellows; in the autumn sun they seem to glow. A slight wind rustles the leaves and they shimmer like sparks, as if the tree is warning of a storm. The trunk of the tree is strong, and its bark is worn with age and bark beetle scars. Filled with life and rooted in the ground, its spirit is vibrant and strong.",
