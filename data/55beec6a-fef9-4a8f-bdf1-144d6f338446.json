  "instruction": "Design a visually pleasing presentation about renewable energy sources.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The presentation should start off by introducing renewable energy sources, naming and briefly discussing solar, wind, and geothermal power. Each of these sources should then have their own slide, where a more detailed description is given. Visual aids such as diagrams, graphs and photos should be used to illustrate the slides and help to explain complex concepts. One slide should be dedicated to a comparison of the cost efficiency and energy sources, and this should be represented in a clear and concise manner. Finally, a conclusion should be provided that wraps up the presentation and conveys why renewable energy source are important for humans and for the environment.",
