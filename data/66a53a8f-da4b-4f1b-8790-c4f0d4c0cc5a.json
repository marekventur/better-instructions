  "input": "",
  "output": "Trust is an important factor for team collaboration because it allows for open communication and encourages members to be honest and forthright with their thoughts and opinions. Without trust, team members may feel hesitant to express their ideas for fear of criticism or judgement, hindering the team's creativity and productivity. Additionally, when team members trust one another, they are more willing to take on difficult tasks and collaborate effectively, leading to better results.",
