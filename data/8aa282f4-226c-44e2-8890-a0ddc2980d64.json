  "input": "",
  "output": "Text classification is a supervised learning method that requires labeled training data and involves classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and spam detection, where the output is a class label such as positive, negative, or neutral for sentiment analysis, or spam and not-spam for spam detection. \n\nText clustering, on the other hand, is an unsupervised learning approach which does not rely on labeled training data. It is a process where documents are grouped into collections or clusters based on their similarity. Clustering can help in reducing the dimensionality of a large dataset, better understand a document collection by seeing which documents are similar, or discover structures and topics within a group of documents. Unlike text classification, the output of the clustering process is a set of clusters where each cluster contains similar documents.",
