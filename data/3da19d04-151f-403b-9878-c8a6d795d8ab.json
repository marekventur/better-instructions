  "output": "The basic principles of the theory of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin, are that all life on Earth has descended from a common ancestor and that this evolution occurs over time via the process of natural selection. Natural selection is the process by which individuals who are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their traits to their offspring. This process leads to the formation of new species and allows for adaptation in a changing environment. \n\nIn addition, the theory of evolution explains how new genetic variations arise, how organisms acquire inherited traits, and how species diverge with time.",
