  "output": "Climate change is a broad term that describes the long-term changes in the global climate due to the increase of certain gases in the atmosphere. These gases, primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, trap heat from the sun, causing the planet's temperature to gradually increase, leading to more extreme weather patterns, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and other impacts.",
