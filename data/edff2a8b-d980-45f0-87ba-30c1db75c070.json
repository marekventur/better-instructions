  "output": "In the United States, voting is a two-step process. First, individuals must register to be eligible to vote. This typically involves submitting paperwork to state or local officials, often in person or by mail. Once registered, individuals can cast their ballots at a designated polling location during a designated time period. Election day is typically held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. In many states, early voting is also available, allowing individuals to cast their ballots in advance. Once the votes have been cast, they are tallied and the winner is determined.",
