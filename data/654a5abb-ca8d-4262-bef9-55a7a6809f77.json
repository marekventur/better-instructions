  "input": "Text 1: The recent emergence of fine-tuning continuous prompts as a compact alternative to full model fine-tuning has sparked interest in this area.\nText 2: Recent research in continuous prompts for natural language tasks has shown great success in effectively fine-tuning models with fewer training examples.",
  "output": "Text 1 and Text 2 both describe recent successes of continuous prompts for natural language tasks. In Text 1, this success is described in terms of fine-tuning as a compact alternative to full model fine-tuning, while Text 2 links the success to fewer training examples being needed. Both texts indicate that continuous prompts are highly effective at fine-tuning natural language models.",
