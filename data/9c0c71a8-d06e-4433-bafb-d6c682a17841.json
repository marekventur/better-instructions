  "output": "Team-building exercises can be creative and fun. One such exercise could be a \"trust walk\". Participants would be placed in pairs or groups with each person blindfolded, and then each team would have to work together to make it through an obstacle course. This would teach teamwork and communication skills, as the team would have to communicate in order to successfully complete the task. It would also help build trust between the team members, as they would all have to rely on each other and trust each other's directions.",
