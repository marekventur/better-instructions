  "input": "",
  "output": "A Magic 8-Ball is a fortune-telling toy that produces answers to questions by giving randomly generated predictions. It consists of a hollow, black, plastic 8-ball with a smooth surface. Inside, there is a plastic cylinder filled with an alcohol-based liquid, which is colored blue, and a set of 20 floating die-shaped objects. A person asks the toy a yes or no question, shakes it, and then turns it over so that a die rises to the window located at one end, which displays a response to the person\u2019s question.",
