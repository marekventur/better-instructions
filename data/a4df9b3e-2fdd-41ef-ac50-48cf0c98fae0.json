  "input": "",
  "output": "Bacteria and fungi are both important in the decomposition of organic matter. Bacteria are responsible for the breakdown of organic matter into simple molecules, while fungi break down complex molecules into simpler ones. Fungi also play an important role in the absorption of nutrients from organic matter by releasing enzymes that penetrate cell walls. Fungi also helps to protect the environment from toxins. Bacteria, on the other hand, help to create soil for plants by breaking down organic matter and releasing nutrients for plant growth. Both bacteria and fungi are essential for the decomposition of organic matter and for replenishing the soil for plant growth.",
