  "output": "One way to teach a computer to count to ten would be to use a loop, where the program runs through the same code block until it reaches the desired number. The code would look something like this: \n\nfor(int i=1; i<=10; i++) {\n  cout << i;\n}\n\nThis loop would output the numbers from one to ten.",
