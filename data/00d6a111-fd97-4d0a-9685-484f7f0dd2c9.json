  "output": "Cheetahs and lions are two of the most familiar animals in the wild. Cheetahs are the world's fastest land mammal and are found in parts of Africa and the Middle East. They are slender, with a tawny coat and black spots. Lions, on the other hand, are much larger and more muscular. They are typically tawny in color with dark manes. In terms of behavior, cheetahs are less social than lions, typically hunting and travelling alone or in small groups. Lions, meanwhile, live together in larger prides and have a reputation for fiercely protecting their territory. Cheetahs are much faster than lions, reaching speeds of up to 75 mph, but unfortunately are much less formidable predators due to their slender builds, and are typically unable to take down large prey. Lions, on the other hand, have much larger and more powerful jaws, giving them an upper hand in hunting.",
