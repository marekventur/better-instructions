  "input": "",
  "output": "Going to school is important for numerous reasons.  First, education gives students the tools needed to pursue their dreams. Schools teach necessary skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity, which can help students achieve their goals. Schools also provide an opportunity to network and develop social skills, which can be critical to success later in life. Second, attending school helps to instill a sense of discipline and order that can carry through later years. Homework encourages responsibility and commitment to learning. Third, school can help build self-esteem. In the company of other students and teachers, success and failure are shared, and students can learn to appreciate their own strengths and weaknesses. Fourth, school provides a wide range of opportunities to explore outside of the classroom, be it extracurricular activities, student government, or special projects that can help a student to find his or her own voice. Finally, school helps to open doors to higher education and career paths that may not have been available without a formal education. Attending school is important for these and many other reasons.",
