  "input": "",
  "output": "The rising population is having a hugely detrimental effect on the environment. More people equate to higher resource consumption and waste production. This leads to deforestation, biodiversity loss and pollution from vehicles, factories and landfills. Likewise, the amount of agricultural land is increasing simultaneously, leading to further deforestation, soil erosion and the loss of natural habitats. In addition, the climate is changing rapidly due to increased emissions of greenhouse gases, which further damages ecosystems and the environment as a whole.",
