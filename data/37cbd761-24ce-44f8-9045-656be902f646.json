  "input": "",
  "output": "There are multiple ways to reduce energy consumption in homes. One way is to switch to energy-efficient lighting, such as LED and CFL bulbs. Another way is to unplug appliances when not in use. A third way is to turn down the thermostat and use a space heater instead when possible. A fourth way is to install efficient appliances and devices such as washing machines and refrigerators. Finally, using solar panels to capture renewable energy from the sun is an excellent way to reduce energy consumption.",
