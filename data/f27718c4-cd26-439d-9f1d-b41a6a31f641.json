  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a person who wanted nothing more than to see the world. So, she saved up all her money and set out on an adventure around the world. She started in her native country, then she travelled through Europe, Asia, and Africa. Wherever she went, she made friends and explored places she had never before seen. \n\nShe tasted food that she had never before tried. She walked on beaches that were unlike anything she had ever experienced. She hiked through jungles and saw exotic wildlife with her own eyes. She visited old, historical sites that once were home to powerful civilizations. Everywhere she went, she encountered different cultures, languages and customs. \n\nFinally, after a year of travelling, she returned home. However, she still yearns to set out to explore the world and experience the many wonders it has to offer.",
