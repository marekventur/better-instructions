  "output": "The article focuses on how technology has had a negative impact on our environment. It states that deforestation, caused by the use of fossil fuels in the production of materials, has caused an increase in global temperatures and an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Additionally, technology has produced waste, both in the form of physical waste generated through production, as well as in the form of electronic waste such as computers and phones, which are often discarded prematurely. This waste has caused air and water pollution that affects ecosystems, habitats, and human health. The article provides ways to reduce the impacts of technology on the environment, such as reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, creating recycling programs, and investing in renewable energy sources.",
