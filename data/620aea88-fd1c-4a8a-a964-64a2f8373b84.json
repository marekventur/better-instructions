  "instruction": "Decorate the following space while staying within a budget of $1000.",
  "input": "A bare kitchen.",
  "output": "For a kitchen within a budget of $1000, you can freshen up the space with a new coat of neutral paint, buy a rug for the floor for an added element of comfort, and attach curtains to the windows for a touch of color. You can also add some potted plants to the countertops or shelves to brighten up the room and set the mood. You may also replace the existing appliances with energy-efficient models, or you can buy new kitchenware, such as utensils, containers and a blender. Finally, don't forget to spruce up the cabinets by attaching fresh knobs and handles.",
