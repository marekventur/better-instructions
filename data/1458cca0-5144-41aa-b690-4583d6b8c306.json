  "output": "Hey friend! \n\nI hope you're doing well and staying safe! I wanted to let you know that there's a concert next Saturday night that I thought you might be interested in. It's going to be held outdoors so it'll be fun to enjoy some live music after so long! It starts at 7 PM so I thought we could meet up a bit earlier and get some food before the show. \n\nLet me know if you're up for it!\n\nTake care, \n<Your Name>",
