  "output": "Shoulders slumped, head down low \nFeet heavy, mind in a haze\nA difficult situation takes its toll\nBut will not take away his faith.\n\nHis heart\u2019s sorrow brings tears to his eyes \nBut his courage knows no bounds\nHe may be struggling, but he stands strong\nWith a newfound wisdom that he has found.\n\nThe darkness of the night lasts only soon\nThough he may feel a lack of control\nSoon, dawn will break and time will tell\nThe will to face the future is his goal.",
