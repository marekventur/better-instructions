  "input": "",
  "output": "Robots are increasingly being used in day-to-day life for various tasks since they bring in many benefits. To begin with, robots are fast, efficient, and reliable which makes them a great option in tasks that must adhere to precision. Moreover, robots do not require breaks like humans, meaning they can persist in performing their tasks for longer hours. This allows businesses to remain active and productive even during off-peak hours. Additionally, robots are also used to explore hostile environments where humans are incapable of venturing. Finally, robots can perform dangerous tasks, avoiding harm for humans. All these benefits help make robots an invaluable tool in the modern-day.",
