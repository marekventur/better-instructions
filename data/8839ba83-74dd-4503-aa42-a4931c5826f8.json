  "instruction": "Compare and contrast commercial banks and investment banks.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Commercial banks are financial institutions that provide services to their customers, such as loans, deposits, and investment management. Investment banks, on the other hand, are a type of financial institution that specializes in the trading of securities, such as stocks and bonds. The main difference between the two is that commercial banks provide services to customers, while investment banks provide services to governments, corporations, and wealthy individuals. Commercial banks are also subject to more regulations than investment banks, as they offer deposit accounts to customers. Investment banks, however, do not accept deposits from the general public and are subject to fewer regulations. Both types of banks are important for the global economy, but their roles and services are different.",
