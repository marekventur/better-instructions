  "output": "One way to reduce the poverty rate in India is to increase investment in education and health services. Investing in these areas would ensure that all citizens are provided with the support they need to break out of poverty. In addition, government policies that focus on increased access to finance, job security, and social safety nets would help to reduce poverty. Additionally, improving infrastructure, such as access to transportation and communications, would increase economic opportunities for everyone.",
