  "output": "The trophic levels of an ocean ecosystem are divided into producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, and decomposers. Producers are organisms like algae, plankton, and seaweed that produce their own energy through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Primary consumers are herbivores that consume producers, such as fish and clams. Secondary consumers are carnivores that feed on primary consumers, such as sharks, dolphins, and orcas. Tertiary consumers are apex predators that feed on other secondary consumers, like whales. Decomposers are organisms like bacteria that break down dead organic material into simpler forms.",
