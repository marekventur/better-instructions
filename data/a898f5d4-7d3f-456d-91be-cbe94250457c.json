This type of system allows employees to easily assign tasks, track progress, prioritize tasks, set deadlines and provide real-time feedback on tasks. Additionally, automation can also help to streamline workflows. Automated processes can be used to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up resources for more complex tasks.
