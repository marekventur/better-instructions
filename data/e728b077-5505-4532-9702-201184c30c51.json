  "input": "",
  "output": "Many humans find comfort in the night sky because it serves as a reminder of our connectedness to the universe. It provides a sense of perspective and allows us to capture the grandeur and majesty of the world. There is also something calming about the stillness and quiet of the night sky, free from the hustle and bustle of daily life. It is a reminder that we are but a small part of something much bigger and more beautiful.",
