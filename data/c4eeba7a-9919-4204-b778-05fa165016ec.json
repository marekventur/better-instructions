  "output": "A term deposit is a type of savings account where the money is invested for a set period of time, typically ranging from one to five years. The money deposited into this account is generally kept untouched during the set period and only used as a savings account or investment option. The benefit of a term deposit is that it typically offers higher interest rates than regular savings accounts, allowing for greater returns on long-term investments.",
