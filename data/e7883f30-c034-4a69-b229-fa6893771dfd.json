  "input": "",
  "output": "Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity is a theory of space-time which states that space and time are inextricably linked and that the laws of physics remain the same regardless of the inertial frame of reference. According to the theory, the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion. This helps explain the nature and behavior of light and the way it is affected by gravitational fields and provides the foundation for understanding the bending of light in the presence of massive bodies. The theory also provides a basis for understanding time dilation and space-time curvature.",
