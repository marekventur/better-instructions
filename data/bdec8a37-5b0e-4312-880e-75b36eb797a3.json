  "input": "",
  "output": "The US has long been an economic leader and powerhouse, and this remains true today. The US has an abundance of resources, including a talented and highly educated workforce, an industrious spirit, and a market-driven economy. This has allowed the US to maintain its competitive edge compared to some of its biggest global rivals such as China and India. The US also has a well-established financial system and institutions that have supported a wide range of innovative businesses. Furthermore, the free trade agreements established by the US over the past decades have allowed US companies to gain access to global markets and create jobs domestically. All of these elements have enabled the US to remain an economic superpower.",
