  "input": "",
  "output": "AI-driven chatbots and virtual agents both use artificial intelligence for various purposes, such as responding to customer inquiries, automating tasks and providing customer service. One key difference between them is that chatbots are designed to respond to user inputs, while virtual agents can actually act on user requests. Chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to interpret user inputs and generate responses, while virtual agents utilize AI-driven decision making capabilities to complete tasks. Additionally, chatbots are designed to be conversational and interactive, while virtual agents are designed to provide users with an intuitive and automated experience.",
