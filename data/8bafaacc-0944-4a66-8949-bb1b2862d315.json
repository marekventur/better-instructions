  "input": "",
  "output": "Naive Bayes is a supervised machine learning algorithm which is used for classification. It is based on Bayes' Theorem which states that the probability of an event given some background information is the product of the probability of the event occurring and the probability of the background information being true. The \u201cnaive\u201d part of the algorithm comes from its assumption that the different features of the data are independent of each other. This simplifies the calculations and makes the algorithm more efficient. The algorithm is first trained using labeled data, and it then uses Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an unseen data point belonging to a certain class. The data point is then classified according to the maximum probability.",
