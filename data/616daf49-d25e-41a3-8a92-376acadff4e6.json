  "input": "",
  "output": "The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most iconic symbols of the city of San Francisco in California. Designed by engineer and architect Joseph Strauss in 1933, the suspension bridge was completed four years later in 1937. It spans the Golden Gate strait, which is the entrance to San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean and is 4,200 feet long, with two towers each at a height of 746 feet, and a main span of 4,200 feet. The main span of the bridge is supported by two hollow steel towers connected by two main cables and is designed to withstand even the strongest of winds and seismic activity.",
