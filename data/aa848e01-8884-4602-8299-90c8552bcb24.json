  "output": "Once upon a time, there were three friends, named Molly, Sophia, and Reggie. They had been best friends since they were children, and shared a deep bond that had never broken. One day, they decided to explore a cave they had heard about in the nearby woods. When they arrived, they noticed a mysterious door, and decided to go inside.\n\nAs soon as they opened the door, they found themselves in a strange, strange place. It was a world in which everything was backwards. Walls were upside down, the sky was green, and the stars had two moons. \n\nThe three of them were shocked, but determined to find a way out. Molly spotted a butterfly, and followed it. Eventually, the butterfly led her to a large tree which she noticed was hollow. Inside the tree, she met a fairy who gave her a wish. But the fairy warned her that in this topsy-turvy world, the wish would have unexpected consequences. Molly thought carefully, and wished to find her way back home. \n\nWhen they returned to the real world, they all realized that the twist was that instead of finding a way out of the upside down world, they had been granted a wish, and the wish had somehow caused them to return home! From that day forwards, they never forget the strange world and the caution they should take when wishing for something.",
