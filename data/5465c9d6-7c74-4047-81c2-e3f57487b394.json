  "instruction": "Compare genetic engineering to traditional breeding methods.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Genetic engineering involves the deliberate manipulation of an organism's genetic material, while traditional breeding methods involve cross-pollination or cross-breeding of two varieties of the same species to produce desirable traits. Genetic engineering is more precise, as desired traits can be introduced into the organism, while traditional breeding relies mainly on chance.",
