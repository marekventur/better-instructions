  "input": "",
  "output": "In literature, orange often symbolizes vibrancy, brilliance, and energy. Orange appears in stories to represent hope, courage, determination, and a sense of being alive. For example, in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, the character Gatsby wears an orange suit to show off his newfound wealth and hope of recreating himself.  It also symbolizes major changes and transitions in life, as it is a combination of yellow and red, representing both joy and potential danger.",
