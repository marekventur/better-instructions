  "input": "",
  "output": "Evolution by natural selection is the process by which variants of certain traits in a species become more or less common over time according to how advantageous they are to survival and reproduction. The traits that are more advantageous are typically passed on to offspring more often, while the less advantageous traits become less common in the gene pool over time. This process results in the species becoming better suited to its environment over successive generations.",
