  "instruction": "Create an algorithm to classify text.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm should begin by tokenizing the text, that is, breaking it down into separate words or phrases. This can be done using a library like NLTK. Next, the algorithm should create an appropriate list of features to represent the text data. This could include the lexical richness of the text, the length of words, the presence of certain words or phrases, and any other features that will help the algorithm to better classify the text. Once the features are extracted, the algorithm should split the data into training and testing sets. Finally, the algorithm should use a machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression or Naive Bayes, to train the data and generate predictions for the test data.",
