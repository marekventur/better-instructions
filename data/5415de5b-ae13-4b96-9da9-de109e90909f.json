  "input": "Martha is an 80-year-old former librarian. She loves to garden, but today her plants are disappearing.",
  "output": "Martha spent her day in the garden, tending to her beloved vegetables and plants like she did every day. However, something felt off. She noticed several of her flowers and vegetables had gone missing, so she searched the area for clues. To her surprise, she found a family of bunnies in the garden, devouring her vegetables and flowers. She was amazed and delighted at the same time. She decided to take care of them and provide them with a safe place to stay. Martha and the bunnies grew close to each other, and from then on she never had to worry about anyone stealing from her garden. She loved having them around and was thankful for their presence. She proudly shared her new family with her family and friends, telling them wonderful stories about her mischievous bunnies.",
