  "output": "The primary difference between traditional and digital marketing is the medium used to reach potential customers. Traditional marketing typically involves the use of print, television, or radio to advertise a product or service. Digital marketing, on the other hand, uses digital platforms such as search engines, social media, websites, and applications to reach customers. Digital marketing is typically more cost-effective than traditional marketing, as it allows businesses to target customers with greater precision and personalization. Additionally, digital marketing can provide real-time feedback, which can be used to analyze the success of campaigns and adjust strategies as needed.",
