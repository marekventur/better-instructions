  "output": "The statement \"Online learning is the future of education\" is one that signals a major shift in the way education is delivered in the modern world. With the continuing progress of technology, more and more individuals are finding that they are better served by the convenience, flexibility and affordability of online learning. As traditional brick-and-mortar schools have been at least partially replaced by online universities, many students have taken the opportunity to pursue their educational goals and obtain degrees from the comfort of their own homes. At the same time, educators and employers alike are recognizing the value of online learning, acknowledging the anytime and anywhere access that such a mode of study allows. With the rising accessibility of virtual learning environments and the decreased costs associated with them, it is clear that the future of education is one of increased convenience, affordability and personalization. In other words, the future of education is online!",
