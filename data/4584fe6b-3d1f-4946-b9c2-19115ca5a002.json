  "input": "",
  "output": "The legal principle behind copyright law is that it grants creators exclusive control over the reproduction and distribution of their creative works. This means that anyone who wishes to publish or otherwise make use of a creative work must first obtain permission from the copyright holder. Copyright law seeks to balance the interests of creators and users of creative works by granting exclusive rights to the creator while also allowing use of the work in certain circumstances. This includes the right to make personal copies for private enjoyment and study, and the right to distribute copies for educational purposes. Copyright law also provides rights that allow users to make limited use of a work without permission from the copyright holder, such as making quotations from a work or using a work for criticism or commentary.",
