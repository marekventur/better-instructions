  "output": "The Great Wall of China was not built all at once - it is the result of centuries of work by many Chinese dynasties, beginning in the 7th century BC.  In the 15th century, it was extended and improved by the Ming Dynasty, which added important defensive features such as watchtowers.  Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most recognizable symbols of Ancient Chinese culture.",
