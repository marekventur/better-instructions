  "output": "Some potential objections a customer may have about buying a product include cost, product features, and delivery or shipping times. Cost could be a factor if the customer feels the product is not worth the price. Products features may be a concern if the product does not meet the customer's needs or expectations. Lastly, delivery or shipping times may be an issue if the customer needs the product quickly and the wait time is too long.",
