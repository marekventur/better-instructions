Look for energy-efficient appliances, switch off electrical devices when not in use and replace old lighting fixtures with more efficient ones.\n2. Utilize reusable items as much as possible. Buy items with little to no packaging materials and replace single-use plastics such as straws with reusable metal or bamboo straws.\n3.
