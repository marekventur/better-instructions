  "output": "The sky was a deep blue, \nThe stars twinkled against the night,\nMy heart filled with love anew,\nThe horizon stretched endlessly in sight.\n\nA peace descends upon me,\nBeneath the night sky so grand,\nThe cool winds blow gently,\nCalming my wandering hands.\n\nThe stars so bright and pure,\nNight aloft, eternity in these halls,\nAstride the clouds we do lure,\nFor forever and ever, night calls.\n\nTake a breath of the whispering air,\nTo embrace the generosity of the sky,\nGasping the beauty so rare,\nWe gaze, no words to apply.\n\nBathing in the tender moonlight,\nCradled by the absolute still,\nAwakened in such a wondrous night,\nPeace, where I\u2019m meant to fulfill.",
