  "input": "",
  "output": "Data preprocessing is the process of preparing data for use in machine learning algorithms. It involves cleaning, transforming and normalizing the data for improved model performance. An example of data preprocessing is normalizing numerical values to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which improves the performance of most machine learning models.",
