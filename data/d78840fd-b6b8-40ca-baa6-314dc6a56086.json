  "input": "",
  "output": "Plant cells and animal cells have similar structures that include a nucleus, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, but they also have several notable differences. Plant cells are usually larger, and they have cell walls that are made of cellulose. Plant cells also contain chloroplasts, which are responsible for photosynthesis, and a central vacuole, which is a large fluid-filled organelle. Animal cells do not have these components.",
