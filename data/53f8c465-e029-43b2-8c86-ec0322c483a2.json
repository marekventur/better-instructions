  "input": "",
  "output": "A creative way to present data about water usage for the city could be to create an interactive map that displays how much water is used in each neighborhood. The map could be color coded to indicate the water usage in each area, with an accompanying chart to explain in more detail. It could also feature an interactive tool that would enable users to compare water use in different areas and look at usage by age, gender, and other demographics. Such a tool would allow people to understand the impact their consumption has on the environment and what steps they can take to reduce their consumption of water.",
