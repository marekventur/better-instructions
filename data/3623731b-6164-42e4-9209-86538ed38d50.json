  "input": "",
  "output": "Password strength is a measure of the resistance of a password to guessing or brute-force attacks. Password strength is determined by the length, complexity, and randomness of the password. The longer, more complex, and more random the password, the greater its strength. Password strength should be regularly monitored and updated as needed to ensure maximum protection against malicious attacks.",
