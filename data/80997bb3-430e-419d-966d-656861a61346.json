  "input": "",
  "output": "The streets were empty and quiet as the two cars raced down the highway. The air was filled with the sound of screeching tires and revving engines. The drivers were both determined to win the chase, darting in and out of traffic and weaving in and out of the lanes. The other drivers on the road were forced to get out of the way as the cars sped past them. The chase went on for miles, until finally one of the drivers was able to lose the other and make their escape.",
