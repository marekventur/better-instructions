  "input": "",
  "output": "Pavlovian conditioning does not always work because learning is a complex and unpredictable process, and the desired response from an individual or animal may not be reliably achieved. In addition, the environment and context in which the person or animal is situated can influence how they react to the stimuli, and further complicate achieving a desired response. Pavlovian conditioning relies heavily on repetition and consistency, which may not be feasible or even realistic. While Pavlovian conditioning can be effective in producing certain types of responses, it is not a guaranteed or always successful method.",
