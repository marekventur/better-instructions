  "output": "If I needed to produce a report quickly, I would identify the scope and purpose of the report, then start gathering and organizing relevant data. I would then create an outline with the main points of the report, and prioritize which information needs to be included. After that, I would review the material and write the main body of the report. Finally, I would proofread my work and make sure that it is well-structured, clear, and concise. I would also make sure that it corresponds to the stated purpose, is consistent in its format, and includes accurate facts and figures.",
