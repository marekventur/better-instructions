  "instruction": "Based on the following data points, identify which type of machine learning algorithm is being used.",
  "input": "The data consists of temperature readings from one hundred different air conditioners over an eight-month period.",
  "output": "The machine learning algorithm being used is a regression algorithm. Regression algorithms are used to predict continuous outcomes such as temperature readings. The data points are used to create a predictive model which can accurately predict the readings of a single air conditioner given its data points.",
