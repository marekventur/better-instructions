  "instruction": "Analyze what themes are present in the text below:",
  "input": "Every summer, our family would make the eight-hour drive from Atlanta to Corpus Christi, Texas. We would stay in a rustic guest house with nothing more than the sound of the wind and the tide. Every morning, my grandmother would take me to the beach, and while the sun rose over the horizon, I would dig my toes into the sand and make sandcastles with my siblings.",
  "output": "The themes in the text are family, home, nature, and childhood. The family's reunions symbolize their strong connection, while the rustic guest house and the beach represent nature's beauty. These places provide a sense of comfort, safety, and home. Lastly, childhood is represented by the narrator's nostalgia when reflecting on the activities shared with their siblings.",
