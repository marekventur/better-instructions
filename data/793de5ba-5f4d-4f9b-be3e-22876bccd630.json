  "output": "My gentle heart, so moved by life's forlorn behest, \nIn search of something pure, in me I have confessed. \nWe wander blind, just as the night recedes unseen, \nThough no rare thing or simple act can be redeemed. \n\nWe stumble near our dreams, out of fear and fear's release, \nAlone we stand, with no one else, to give us any peace. \nUpon the day, we'll find our souls united, as one, \nDestined to become, in beauty, what can be begun.\n\nOur paths grow complex, our eyes with longing shine, \nAnd into the light, our spirits seek to find. \nTo brim with life, to saturate our minds, \nAn endless field of dreams, grace for mankind.",
