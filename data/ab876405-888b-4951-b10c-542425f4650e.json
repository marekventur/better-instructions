  "output": "Littering is one of the most destructive, yet preventable, issues facing our planet today. Not only is litter unsightly and unhygienic, it can also cause serious environmental problems. Litter can block drainage systems, endanger wildlife, and leach toxic chemicals into the environment. It can also contribute to global warming by increasing methane production in landfills. In addition, it costs an estimated $11.5 billion per year to clean up after litterbugs. \n\nPeople should have the respect and responsibility to dispose of their waste properly and not pollute the environment. We should all commit to cleaning up after ourselves and each other, as even small actions can make a big difference. Individuals should also be aware and mindful of the amount of waste they are producing and where it is going. Reusable containers and bags should also be used in order to reduce waste. \n\nOur communities, cities, and countries can join forces in order to fight littering. Local governments should step up enforcement of littering laws, and impose fines on those who are caught littering. Solid waste management campaigns should also be put in place in order to educate people on proper waste disposal. Teaching these lessons to children is especially important, as they are the future stewards of our planet.\n\nDon\u2019t be a litterbug. Let\u2019s work together to keep the planet clean and beautiful for generations to come.",
