  "input": "",
  "output": "One potential problem with using AI for job recruitment is the potential for bias in the models. AI algorithms may be trained on datasets that contain implicit or explicit human bias, which could lead to unfair and discriminatory decisions when selecting or interviewing candidates. Additionally, AI may not take into account the nuances of human behavior, such as soft skills, making it difficult to make an accurate assessment of a candidate's potential.",
