  "input": "",
  "output": "Try getting creative with meal planning. Instead of eating the same things every day, switch up meals with healthy alternatives like veggie wraps or Buddha bowls. Have some fun with it by looking up new recipes and experimenting with different ingredients. You could also try taking up a hobby that encourages physical activity, like tennis, biking, or swimming. This can make exercising something to look forward to.",
