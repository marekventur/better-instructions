  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) is that NLP focuses on the syntax, semantics, and structure of the language, whereas NLU focuses on understanding the underlying meaning of the language. NLP aims to parse and analyze the structure and composition of the language, while NLU is concerned with understanding the context and intention of the language. NLP focuses on producing structured output from unstructured text, while NLU's goal is to extract useful insights from natural language.",
