  "input": "",
  "output": "GitHub can be used as an effective project management tool by leveraging its various features. GitHub allows users to create repositories which acts as a centralised hub for all of the project\u2019s documents, code, and other related materials. By using features such as pull requests, code reviews, and branch permissions, users can control changes to the project code and documents. Additionally, GitHub can be used for collaboration by giving users visibility into the progress of a project and its members. Through its wide range of features, GitHub can be used to track, organise, and manage the development of any project.",
