  "input": "",
  "output": "Two steps that can help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro, and increased energy efficiency measures such as insulation, air-tight windows, and efficient lightbulbs. These efforts can reduce the amount of CO2 produced by burning fossil fuels for energy and help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
