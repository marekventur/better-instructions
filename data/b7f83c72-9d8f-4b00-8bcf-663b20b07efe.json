  "output": "Recycling is an effective way to conserve resources, reduce pollution, and prevent global warming. When we recycle, we increase the lifespan of many products and divert items from landfills, which reduces greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere. Recycling also creates jobs, reduces energy consumption and raw material needs, and helps protect natural habitats from human destruction. Recycling not only benefits the planet, but also our wallet, as it saves money in energy and transport costs. Every day, each of us can make a difference by recycling, reducing and reusing.",
