  "input": "",
  "output": "An encryption protocol should consist of an authentication process, a cryptographic method, a key exchange protocol, and an authentication protocol. The authentication process should verify that the data being exchanged is from a trusted source. The cryptographic method should provide privacy and authenticity of the contents. The key exchange protocol should securely transport a key used to encrypt the data. The authentication protocol should ensure the data wasn't modified in transit.",
