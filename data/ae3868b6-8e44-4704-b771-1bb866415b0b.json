  "instruction": "Analyze the following situation and explain why it could be seen as unethical.",
  "input": "A CEO of a large company has been making decisions without consulting her board of directors.",
  "output": "It could be seen as unethical because it goes against the principle of shared decision-making, which is important for the stability and oversight of the company. The CEO has a responsibility to the board of directors and to the company as a whole to ensure decisions are made in consultation with all relevant stakeholders. Additionally, it could be seen as a sign of a lack of trust in the board of directors - a situation where the CEO does not feel their input is valued is inherently unethical.",
