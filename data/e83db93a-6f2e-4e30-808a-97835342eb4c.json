  "input": "Instruction: Write a story about someone who is uncomfortable in crowded places.\nInput:\nA young man named David was always anxious when it came to being in crowded places.",
  "output": "David always felt uncomfortable in crowded places. He could see the curious stares of strangers who seemed to be judging him and the awkwardness of shuffling against them as he tried to move through the crowd. He would never eat alone in public places and found it difficult to enter a room with lots of people. \n\nHe tried to remind himself that no one was judging him, but he couldn't shake the feeling of anxiousness. Despite his anxiety, David still lived his life. He slowly started attending social gatherings, even if it meant enduring a lot of discomfort. He learned how to make small talk and how to actively engage in group conversations. \n\nDavid continued to take baby steps. He started making more friends and exploring new places. He realized that the more he practiced being around people and facing the fear, the easier it became. He still felt anxious at times, but he didn't let it stop him from living life to the fullest. Slowly but surely, he overcame his fear of being in crowded places. Now he's able to confidently go to events, parties and many other places without any hesitation.",
