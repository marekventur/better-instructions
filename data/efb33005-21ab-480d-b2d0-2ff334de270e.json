  "input": "Google and Bing",
  "output": "Google and Bing are two of the most popular search engine algorithms. Google uses a more sophisticated ranking system that considers factors such as relevance, freshness and authority of pages. Bing employs a web crawling system that looks for web pages through web links and content. Bing is more user-friendly and allows for greater customization of search results, while Google emphasizes the search engine optimization of webpages and focuses more on ranking content.",
