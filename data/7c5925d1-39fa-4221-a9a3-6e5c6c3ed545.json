  "output": "1. Climate change has been linked to an increase in air pollution, which can cause a range of respiratory and cardiovascular problems in humans.\n2. Extreme weather events, such as flooding, have been linked to increased cases of waterborne and vector-borne illnesses.\n3. Warmer temperatures can lead to an increase in the spread of disease-carrying organisms, such as mosquitos, ticks and rodents. This can contribute to the spread of illnesses like malaria, Lyme disease, dengue fever and West Nile virus.",
