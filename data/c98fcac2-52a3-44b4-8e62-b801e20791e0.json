  "input": "Version A: The Starry Night by Van Gogh\nVersion B: The Starry Night by Claude Monet",
  "output": "Van Gogh's painting of 'The Starry Night' is dominated by a swirling blue night sky full of stars, a dark rolling hill, a church tower, and a crescent moon. Claude Monet's version of 'The Starry Night' is much brighter than its predecessor. Instead of an array of stars, there are just a few faint stars depicting a twilight sky. The rolling hills are pale green and bright yellow instead of dark, and the church tower is replaced with a small cottage, located in a calm, sunlit landscape.",
