  "input": "",
  "output": "When storing large amounts of data, it is important to have reliable, secure methods for doing so. The most common options for data storage include hard drives, SSD drives, and cloud storage. Hard drives are physical devices that allow for large amounts of data to be stored on a single device, while solid-state drives (SSDs) use less power and can offer faster data access. Cloud storage is an increasingly popular option which allows for data to be stored securely on remote servers and accessed from any device with an internet connection.",
