  "input": "",
  "output": "The phrases \"strong willed\" and \"persistent\" both refer to a person's drive and determination. However, they have different definitions and connotations. Someone who is strong willed is usually focused on their own objectives and goals, while someone who is persistent is willing to put in the necessary effort despite any difficulties or discouragement they may face. Both qualities can lead to success if applied correctly.",
