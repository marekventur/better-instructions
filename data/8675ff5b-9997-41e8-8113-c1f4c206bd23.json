  "input": "",
  "output": "The Treaty of Versailles was the peace settlement signed after World War I which ended the state of war between the Allied Powers and Germany. It imposed severe restrictions on the German military, reduced Germany's territory, and demanded hefty reparations from the defeated nation. Furthermore, the Treaty established the League of Nations and assigned Germany the responsibility for starting the war. Although originally accepted by the German government, the harsh conditions and overwhelming debt led to a major backlash and ultimately helped to create fertile grounds for the rise of Nazi Germany.",
