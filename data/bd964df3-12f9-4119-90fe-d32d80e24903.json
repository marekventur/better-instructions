  "input": "Business Information: Small manufacturing company producing automotive parts",
  "output": "One strategy to reduce operational costs for a small manufacturing company producing automotive parts is to update their existing technology and equipment to be more energy-efficient. This can help to lower electricity costs. Additionally, companies should look into ways to outsource labor or offload certain parts of their production process. By outsourcing or offshoring labor and production, small businesses can create significant savings on their operations costs. Finally, companies may also want to consider automation. Automation can reduce manual labor costs, as well as help to maintain quality and improve operational efficiency.",
