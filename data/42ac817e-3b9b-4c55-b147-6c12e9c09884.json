  "input": "Search term: quantum computing",
  "output": "Quantum computing is a field of computation that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform operations on data. It uses qubits\u2014quantum bits\u2014which can adopt multiple states and can hold more information than classical bits, which are limited to a single state of 0 or 1. This allows quantum computing to process information faster and solve certain problems in fewer steps than conventional computers.",
