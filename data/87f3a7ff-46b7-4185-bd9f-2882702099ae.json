  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a brave and noble prince named Caleb. He had a wonderful life - he was surrounded by people who cared for him, a castle of his own, and the luxury of a life fit for a prince. But one day, things changed drastically. \n\nCaleb was walking in the gardens near his castle when he suddenly became dizzy and fell into a deep sleep. No one knew what had happened. None of the doctors in the kingdom had any answer, and every attempt at waking him up failed. A dark spell had been cast on him, and no one could break it. \n\nDesperate, the king called together all the magical and wise creatures in the land. He asked what could be done to free his son from this cruel fate, but all efforts failed. \n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. The kingdom mourned the fact that their beloved prince seemed to be gone forever; they knew they should move on but it was still too painful to accept. \n\nThen, one day, an unlikely hero appeared in the kingdom. She was an old witch by the name of Cinne, who had been living in the nearby woods. She said she could break the spell on Caleb, but in order to do so, someone must take Caleb on a journey of exploration and discovery. With no other choice, the king agreed and tasked his bravest warrior, Sir William, with this mission.\n\nSo, with the witch's guidance, Sir William set off with the sleeping prince in tow to find the things that would break the spell. He encountered dragons, fairies, and magical creatures during his perilous journey, all to wake the Prince from his long sleep.\n\nOnly time will tell if they will fulfill their quest and if the prince will be able to wake from his slumber. Will they be able to break the spell, or will they be forever lost?",
