  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change is having a major impact on the diversity of ecosystems in Africa. As temperatures rise, many species are being forced to migrate to new habitats or risk being lost forever. This has caused major disruption to the delicate balance of many ecosystems, resulting in the decline of biodiversity. This decline in biodiversity has far-reaching implications, such as decreased food security, increased pressure on natural resources, and weakened soil fertility. Climate change-induced changes in rainfall patterns have also caused changes in water availability, soil erosion, and floods which have had major impacts on human populations and their livelihoods. Additionally, climate change can also cause ocean acidification, leading to a decrease in marine biodiversity.  Overall, climate change is having a devastating impact on the diversity of ecosystems in Africa.",
