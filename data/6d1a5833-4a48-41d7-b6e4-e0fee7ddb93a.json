  "output": "The production process of an autonomous vehicle involves several steps. First, the algorithm used to control the vehicle is developed, which includes mapping the environment and training the AI system to recognize objects and obstacles. Next, the vehicle is assembled, which includes installing components such as sensors, cameras, and other necessary hardware. Finally, the autonomous vehicle is tested to ensure it meets safety and performance standards. During this testing process, the vehicle is exposed to simulated or real-world situations in order to gauge its performance and accuracy.",
