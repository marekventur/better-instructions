  "input": "",
  "output": "A monopoly is when one party has exclusive control over the production or sale of a given product, allowing them to set the price of goods and services without competition. An oligopoly is when a small number of firms control most of the market share, allowing them to collude and set prices in your favor. Monopolies are often illegal, while oligopolies are typically not.",
