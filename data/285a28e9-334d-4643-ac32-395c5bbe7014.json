  "instruction": "Identify three approaches for solving a problem and compare the advantages and disadvantages of each.",
  "input": "Problem: Climate change",
  "output": "There are three major approaches to problem solving climate change. The first is through technological interventions, such as developing renewable energy sources and creating energy-efficient infrastructure. The second is through policy changes, such as creating laws or incentives that incentivize renewable energy usage or penalize non-renewable energy sources. The third is through social movements, such as consumer demand, or public pressure through protests or boycotts. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. Technological interventions can produce immediate results, but they require significant upfront investments. Policy changes can be implemented quickly, but require approval from multiple stakeholders. Social movements may not guarantee change, but can increase public awareness and create pressure for government action.",
