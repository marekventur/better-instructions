  "input": "",
  "output": "Bag of words is a commonly used term in natural language processing (NLP) when analyzing text data. It is a model that assumes that any given document is a collection or \u201cbag\u201d of words, disregarding the structure and order of the words in the document. Each document is represented as an un-ordered collection of words. Words are weighted in a bag of words model based on the number of times they occur in a document. It is typically used for tasks like document classification and topic modeling.",
