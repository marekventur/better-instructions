  "instruction": "Design an experiment to collect data on the impact of social media on people's mental health.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The aim of the experiment would be to collect data on the impact of social media on people's mental health. The experiment would involve recruiting a sample of participants, ideally containing people of diverse backgrounds. Each participant would complete a survey, which would gather data on the amount of time they spend using social media each week, as well as any mental health problems that they have. The additional information gathered would include details of the types of content they are exposed to (such as promotional material, news, and personal posts by friends and family) and the amount of interaction they are involved in (such as likes, comments, and sharing). The participants would then be required to provide a self-report of their mental health after a period of six months. This would provide the basis for comparison to measure the impact of social media on their mental health.",
