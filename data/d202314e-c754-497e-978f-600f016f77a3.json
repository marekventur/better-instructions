  "output": "One learning experience that had the most impact on me was when I studied abroad during college. Experiencing a foreign country and culture first-hand gave me an entirely new perspective on the way people live, think, and even solve problems. I was able to form relationships with people of different backgrounds, learn new concepts, and see the world with fresh eyes. It was an eye-opening experience that changed my life.",
