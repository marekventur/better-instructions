  "input": "",
  "output": "Darwin's Theory of Evolution, also known as \"natural selection,\" proposes that beneficial traits are passed down to successive generations through genetic mutation, while disadvantageous traits are eliminated through competition. Lamarck's Theory of Evolution proposes that acquired traits are passed down to successive generations as a result of an organism's efforts to adapt to its environment. Darwin's theory is supported by scientific evidence, while Lamarck's theory has been largely discredited.",
