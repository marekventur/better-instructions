  "input": "",
  "output": "A strong leader is someone who is innovative, assertive, and has a clear vision. They are also decisive, organized, and good at inspiring and motivating others. A strong follower is someone who is able to take direction and use their skills to help the team achieve its goals. Followers are also able to provide feedback and support their leader while recognizing the value of their own contributions. Leaders and followers both bring different skills and perspectives to the table, but they must work together to achieve success.",
