  "input": "",
  "output": "The AI-based system should be able to analyze customer data and predict customer satisfaction. It should use customer data such as purchase history, past conversations, and feedback to create metrics and insights. Additionally, it should use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and detect patterns of customer behavior. The system should also have the ability to flag customer concerns in real time and recommend ways to improve customer satisfaction. It should provide features such as sentiment analysis, customer segmentation, and targeted marketing.",
