  "output": "The Reformation of the 16th century was a major religious and political movement that began in Europe and spread globally. It started as a response to the perceived shortcomings of the Catholic Church and called for reform and a return to what was seen as the original version of Christianity. This gave rise to new religious denominations, including Lutheranism and Calvinism. The Reformation also had a strong political component, leading to the formation of nation-states and the further erosion of the power of the Catholic Church.",
