  "instruction": "Explain why the actions taken by a certain character are morally wrong.",
  "input": "The protagonist of the story steals from a store.",
  "output": "The protagonist's actions are morally wrong because they involve taking something that does not belong to them without permission. Stealing is wrong as it harms the store, the owner, and other customers who would have bought the items if they had not been stolen. It also sets a bad example and might encourage others to steal as well.",
