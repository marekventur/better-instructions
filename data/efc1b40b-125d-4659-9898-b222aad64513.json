  "output": "A bookshelf or bookcase can be a great way to store books so they don't take up too much space. You can choose one with adjustable shelves so you can customize the height according to the size of your books. If you have a lot of books, consider purchasing a wall-mounted bookshelf to maximize storage space. Alternatively, you can also use book storage boxes or baskets to store books without taking up too much space.",
