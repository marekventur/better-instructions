You?\" \nFriend 1: \"That sounds awesome! I spent most of my summer at home, catching up on the latest shows. But it was nice to have a break from the routine, for sure. So what have you been up to since school started?\" \nFriend 2: \"Oh, same old stuff. Trying to stay on top of classes and manage my extracurriculars. What about you?\" \nFriend 1: \"Definitely. It's been a crazy few weeks balancing all of that. I'm looking forward to some down time soon.\"",
