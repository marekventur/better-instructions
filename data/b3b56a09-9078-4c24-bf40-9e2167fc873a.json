  "output": "The internet has made communication simpler in two primary ways: speed and access. Email, for instance, allows people to quickly and easily share information and documents. In addition, texting and online messaging have made it easier for people to quickly share short pieces of information or have short conversations. Another way the internet has made communication simpler is by allowing access to people virtually anywhere in the world. With messaging applications, video conferencing, and social media, it is now possible to stay connected no matter where you are.",
