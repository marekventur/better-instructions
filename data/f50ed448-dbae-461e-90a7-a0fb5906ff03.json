  "input": "",
  "output": "The magnitude of an earthquake is a measure of the energy released during the event and is based on the amplitude of the waves recorded on a seismograph. It is usually measured on the Richter or Moment Magnitude scale and is usually expressed as a number with up to two decimal places. The higher the magnitude of an earthquake, the more intense the shaking will be and the greater the potential for damage.",
