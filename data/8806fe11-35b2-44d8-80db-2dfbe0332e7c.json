  "output": "The sun is the main source of energy for the Earth's climate. It provides energy through the solar radiation it emits which is the principal driver of weather, climate, and the Earth's energy balance. It plays a critical role in many key climate processes, including the ocean circulation, cloud formation, and the water cycle. Without the sun, the Earth's climate would not exist.",
