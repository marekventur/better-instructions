  "output": "The candle flickered and casted long shadows across the room. A young woman stood in the center of the room, her eyes wide and her breathing shallow. As her gaze wandered along the walls, she noticed a portrait hung up of someone she recognized. With a sudden realization, she rushed to the painting, studying every detail carefully. As she looked closer she could see him in the shadowy corners, huddled and watching her from the darkness.",
