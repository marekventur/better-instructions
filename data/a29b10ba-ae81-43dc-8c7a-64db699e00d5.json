  "input": "",
  "output": "The main causes of the American Civil War were slavery, states' rights, and economic differences between the northern and southern states. Slavery was a key issue, as the northern states had abolished it while the southern states had kept it as an economic cornerstone. States' rights was another major cause as the southerners argued that they had the right to make their own laws, while the north claimed the right of the federal government to regulate slavery across the country. Finally, economic differences between the north and south prompted the breakup of the Union, as the south was largely agricultural while the north was more industrialized.",
