  "input": "",
  "output": "One possible solution to reduce downtown traffic congestion is to increase public transportation options. This could include expanding bus and subway lines, or introducing new transportation systems like ride-sharing programs and dedicated bike lanes. This would reduce the number of cars on the road, allowing for smoother and faster travel during rush hour. Increased investment in bicycle and scooter sharing programs could also help to reduce traffic congestion.",
