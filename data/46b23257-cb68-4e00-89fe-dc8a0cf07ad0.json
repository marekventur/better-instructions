  "output": "A computer mouse is an input device used to interact with a computer. It is typically used to control the position of a cursor on a computer display. A mouse generally has two primary components: a tracking device and one or more buttons. The tracking device, usually an optical or mechanical sensor, allows the user to interact with the user interface. It is usually located on the bottom side, and is typically referred to as the ball, trackball, or trackpad. The buttons, also known as the primary button, secondary button, and scroll wheel are used for various tasks such as selection, zooming, opening or saving files, and scrolling through documents. The most common uses for a computer mouse are pointing, clicking, and dragging. Pointing is used to move the cursor to a specific area of the screen, clicking is used to select an item or execute a command, and dragging is used to move an object or select a range.",
