  "output": "Good morning everyone! \nToday, I\u2019d like to talk about why consideration for the environment is so important. Every day, we are consuming vast amounts of the Earth\u2019s natural resources just to meet our own demands. The global climate crisis is a direct consequence of this careless use of materials, energy, and resources. This means that it\u2019s not only up to governments and corporations, but all of us \u2013 individuals and communities \u2013 to start taking responsibility for the environment. We all have the power to make a difference by consuming fewer resources, reducing waste and emissions, and practising sustainable behaviours. Let's show our planet love and respect and start making the changes necessary today to create a better tomorrow! #Environment #Sustainability",
