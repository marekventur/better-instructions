  "output": "Carefully select the point on the wall where you would like to drill the hole. Make sure it is at least as far away as the edge of the drill bit from any electrical wiring, pipes or other sensitive objects. Secure the drill bit with a drill bit guide to help ensure it stays straight. Be sure you are wearing safety glasses and a dust mask before you begin. Adjust the drill to the appropriate speed for drilling into the wall material and steadily drill the hole. Clean up any debris once you\u2019ve finished. #GPT#Model#Answer#Drilling#Hole#Wall",
