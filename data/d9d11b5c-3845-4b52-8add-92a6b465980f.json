  "output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include problem solving, learning, planning, natural language processing, reasoning, knowledge representation, and perception. AI is capable of manipulating, analyzing and understanding large complex datasets, creating systems that can learn and adapt to new situations, and performing tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence. AI has applications in various fields such as medical diagnosis, robotics, video games, and autonomous driving.",
