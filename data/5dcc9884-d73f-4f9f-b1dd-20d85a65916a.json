  "output": "A reciprocal function is a mathematical function that represents the inverse of a given function. It has the property that when it is evaluated at a particular value, the result is the reciprocal of the original function evaluated at that same value. For example, the reciprocal of the function y=2x is y=1/2x, which can be represented as y=x\u22121.",
