  "input": "",
  "output": "In the US, the fast food industry is extremely popular, with about three million fast food restaurants and 50 million customers served daily. The UK, on the other hand, has around 11,000 fast food restaurants, which are smaller in number than those in the US. In terms of nutritional content, fast food in the US is generally higher in calories and fat, while fast food in the UK is lower in calories and fat. Furthermore, the UK is more strict with regulation of the fast food industry, requiring certain minimum nutritional standards for menus and responsible advertising to children.",
