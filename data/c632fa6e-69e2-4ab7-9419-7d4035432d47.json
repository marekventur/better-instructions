  "input": "",
  "output": "When people from different cultures interact, they may interpret communication cues differently. For example, in some countries it can be considered polite to make direct eye contact while speaking, while in other cultures averting one's gaze can signal deference and respect. This can lead to misunderstandings if one person is following the norms of one culture while the other person is expecting those of another.",
