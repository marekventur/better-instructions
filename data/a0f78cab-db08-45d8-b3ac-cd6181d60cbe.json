  "input": "",
  "output": "Scarcity was a huge factor for the ancient civilizations, as it has been for much of human history. Limited resources forced ancient civilizations to live conservatively, make decisions to maximize the use of their resources, and form alliances with other civilizations in order to use resources that were not available to them. This led to trade, which in turn increased the size of kingdoms and empires. Scarcity also created competition among groups of people, which led to conflict and war in some cases. As resources began to deplete, this could be a major factor in the decline of ancient civilizations.",
