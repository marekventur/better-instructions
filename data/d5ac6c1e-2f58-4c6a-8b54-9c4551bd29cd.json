  "output": "I am applying for a student visa to study English at a language school in the United States of America. I am from Chile and am 18 years old. I plan to study for 6 months beginning in April 2021. I have a passport from Chile with an expiration date of May 2022, and I have a bachelor\u2019s degree in applied mathematics. To support my stay in the United States, I have sufficient funds for airfare, school tuition, and living expenses. I have no criminal record. I plan to stay with a host family during my stay in the United States, and I am excited to learn more about American culture while pursuing my studies.",
