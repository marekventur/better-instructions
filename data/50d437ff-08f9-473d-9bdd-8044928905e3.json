  "instruction": "Explain why it is important to use renewable energy sources.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Using renewable energy sources is important because they are an unlimited and clean fuel source. Renewable energy is also good for the environment since it does not produce greenhouse gases like fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind can also be used to replace dirty energy sources such as coal and oil. Finally, renewable energy helps reduce our dependence on other countries for energy, increasing our energy security.",
