  "instruction": "Use the given facts to write an essay about global warming.",
  "input": "Global warming is the gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and its oceans, a change that is believed to be permanently changing the Earth\u2019s climate.",
  "output": "Climate change is impacting the world in a myriad of ways, but none more evident than global warming. Global warming, or the gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and its oceans, is a direct result of human activities. Carbon dioxide emissions, deforestation, and natural fluctuations in the Earth's orbit are all contributing to the rising temperature, which in turn is causing dramatic shifts in weather patterns, sea levels, and animal and plant habitats. Unless we make drastic changes, global warming could lead to droughts and famine, species extinction, and increased levels of air, water, and land pollution. To avoid the dire consequences of global warming, humanity must act now to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and work together to find lasting solutions.",
