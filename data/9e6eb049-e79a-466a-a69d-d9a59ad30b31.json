  "output": "A typical software engineering workflow involves planning and design, development, testing and integration, documentation, and maintenance and support. During the planning and design phase, the required components and features of the software are determined. The development stage involves coding, unit testing, and debugging. Afterwards, integration testing is done and the software is released. Documentation is then created and maintained, and the software is monitored for issues and bugs that need to be fixed. Finally, the software is updated and released as needed.",
