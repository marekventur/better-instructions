  "instruction": "Design a photographic project to document the culture of a specific city.",
  "input": "City: Melbourne",
  "output": "For my photographic project, I would document the culture of Melbourne. I would use my photographs to capture the city's unique mix of suburban, alternative, and traditional cultures. I would take pictures of the people and places in the city, such as street art, cafes, libraries, and theatres. I would also look to capture the moments of everyday life, like people enjoying a drink in a beer garden or walking through the park on a sunny day. This project would demonstrate the multiculturalism of Melbourne and provide an insight into its vibrant culture.",
