Alice had a kind heart and was always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. One day, while tending to her garden, Alice encountered a strange rabbit wearing a waistcoat. He beckoned her to follow him and she did, leading Alice down a rabbit hole, and into an adventure full of magical creatures and wonderful discoveries.",
