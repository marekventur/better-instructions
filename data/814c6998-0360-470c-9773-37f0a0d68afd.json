  "input": "",
  "output": "Net neutrality is the idea that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally. This means that ISPs cannot charge different prices for providing access to specific websites or services, and they cannot discriminate against or give preferential treatment to certain kinds of data. This ensures that everyone is able to access the same resources and content regardless of their income level or geographical location.",
