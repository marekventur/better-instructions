  "output": "Good morning everyone! Today, I am here to motivate you to take action in the fight for our planet: recycling. In our world today, plastic waste is overflowing into our oceans and landfills, and it is damaging our environment and wildlife. Even worse, it is setting us up for future catastrophes like floods, droughts and famine. Recycling not only helps slow the production of plastic waste and the damage it causes, but it also saves energy and resources. With recycling, we could keep plastic waste out of our landfills and oceans, and instead, turn it into valuable resources. We have the power to make a big impact on our environment and that\u2019s why I urge you all to make the switch to recycling. Let's work together to reduce the amount of plastic waste in our world and make our future brighter.",
