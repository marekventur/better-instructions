  "instruction": "Describe the differences between Exclusionary and Inclusionary zoning.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Exclusionary zoning is a form of land-use regulation which seeks to restrict certain types of development in an area, primarily for the purpose of preserving the character of the community and preventing lower-income residents from occupying the land. Inclusionary zoning is when a regional government requires that a certain percentage of new residential construction is affordable to low and moderate-income residents. The primary benefit of inclusionary zoning is that it can create more housing opportunities for those who would otherwise be unable to find affordable housing.",
