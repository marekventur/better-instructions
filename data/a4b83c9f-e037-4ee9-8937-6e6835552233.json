  "input": "",
  "output": "To address the issue of youth unemployment, policy makers should focus on investing in proper education and skills training. This will enable young people to gain the necessary skills and qualifications to compete in the modern job market. In addition, initiatives should be taken to actively attract employers and businesses with incentives such as tax cuts and subsidies in order to create more job opportunities for young people. To further support youth employment, existing government programs such as Youth Allowance and job training programs should be supported. Moreover, governments should consider setting up job mentor programs to help young job seekers to gain more practical and relevant job experience.",
