  "input": "The product is a miniature Christmas tree made with real pine needles and artificial snow. It's sold in department stores and online.",
  "output": "The best strategy to maximize revenue from this product is to ensure that it's well-stocked both in the stores and online. To ensure that it's always visible to potential customers, it should be placed in prime display locations, such as near the store entrances or checkout lines. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the product is well-promoted online. This could include advertising on social media, creating content that demonstrates its beauty and uses, and creating compelling email campaigns to draw customers in.
