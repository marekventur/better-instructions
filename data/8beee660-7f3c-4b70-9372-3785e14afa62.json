  "input": "",
  "output": "Elimination in mathematics is the process of solving a system of equations by match solving of equations or by substitution. The main idea behind elimination is to find out the solutions of the variables by isolating them and solving for them independently. This is usually done by manipulating the equations and introducing new variables or using various mathematical theorems to reduce the problem to a simpler form.",
