  "instruction": "Explain the impact of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Ocean acidification is caused by increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere which, in turn, result in decreased pH levels in the ocean. This decrease in pH has a dramatic effect on the oceans, especially for calcifying species like coral reefs and mollusks, which are extremely sensitive to even minor changes in pH. Acidification decreases the availability of carbonate ions, which are essential for the formation of shells and skeletons in a variety of organisms. As a result, ocean acidification has the potential to drastically alter marine ecosystems by depleting these species, as well as other species that rely on them.",
