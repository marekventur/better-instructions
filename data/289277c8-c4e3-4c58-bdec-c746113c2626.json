  "input": "John: I don't understand why my sales are down this month.",
  "output": "Sandra: Maybe it's because your competitors have been expanding their products and offering lower prices? Have you taken a look at their offerings recently?\n\nJohn: Yeah, you're right. I haven't been keeping up with what they're doing and it's cost me business. I better get back on track.\n\nSandra: That's a good idea. Maybe you can find a way to differentiate your products and services, so you can stand out in the market.\n\nJohn: That's a great suggestion. I think I know what to do. Thanks for your help.",
