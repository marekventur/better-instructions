  "output": "Environment conservation can be improved by reducing the amount of time we spend in cars and opting for greener transport, such as public transport, walking and cycling. Additionally, taking measures to reduce air pollution and waste production, utilising renewable energy, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and reducing resource consumption through sustainable consumption and production strategies can all help to improve environment conservation. Governments and businesses can also play a role in improving environment conservation by implementing policies and initiatives that reduce the impact of their activities on the environment.",
