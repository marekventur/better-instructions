  "instruction": "Explain why some people choose to use alternative energy instead of traditional energy sources.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Many people choose to use alternative energy sources because they are renewable, cost-effective, and tend to emit fewer pollutants than traditional energy sources. Renewable sources of energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal, do not produce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, meaning they are better for the environment. Additionally, these energy sources are usually cheaper to produce than traditional sources, making them more affordable and accessible.",
