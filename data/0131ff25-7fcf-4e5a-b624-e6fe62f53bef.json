  "input": "",
  "output": "A nuclear chain reaction is a process in which the nucleus of an atom splits, releasing energy in the form of radiation and electrons, and creating two or more smaller nuclei. This process is called fission, and it is typically initiated by a neutron, which splits the nucleus of the atom and releases more neutrons, which can then go on to fission more nuclei in a chain reaction. This chain reaction is what powers nuclear reactors, and can also be used as a weapon when harnessed in a critical mass.",
