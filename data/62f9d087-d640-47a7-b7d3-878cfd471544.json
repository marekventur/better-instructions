  "input": "",
  "output": "The major difference between a private and a public university is funding. Private universities rely heavily on tuition fees, endowments, and private donations for their funding, while public universities are funded mostly by state and federal funds. Private universities usually offer smaller classes, more flexible course offerings, and more advanced facilities compared to public universities. They also tend to provide more extensive career services and alumni networks, while public universities tend to be more affordable and have larger class sizes.",
