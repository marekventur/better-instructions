  "output": "Deep learning is a type of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks, which are networks structured like the neurons in the human brain. Deep learning allows machines to learn when exposed to large amounts of data, without the need for explicit programming rules. With deep learning, machines are able to identify patterns in data, recognize objects, and perform other tasks, just like a human brain. Deep learning can be used for a variety of tasks such as speech recognition, natural language processing, image and video analysis, and more.",
