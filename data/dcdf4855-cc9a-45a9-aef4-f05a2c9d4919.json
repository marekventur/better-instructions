  "input": "",
  "output": "The three specific benefits of using 3D printing are cost savings, faster turnaround times, and fewer design limitations. Cost savings come from the ability to produce complex structures without tooling and the ability to produce multiple parts from a single build. Faster turnaround times are enabled by rapid prototyping, which allows for quick iteration, production flexibility, and customization of parts. Finally, 3D technology removes the physical limitations of traditional manufacturing, such as size and complexity, allowing for near-unlimited design possibilities.",
