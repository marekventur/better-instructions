  "output": "Exponential growth is a pattern of growth that occurs when a quantity increases at a rate that is proportional to its current value. In other words, it is a growth at a constant rate, with each amount of time resulting in an increase that is a multiple of the previous amount. As a result, exponential growth is rapid and can quickly lead to a large increase in the size of a quantity over a short amount of time.",
