  "output": "Debit and credit cards are both payment methods with many similarities, but there are important differences between the two. Debit cards are linked to a checking account and allow you to make payments directly from your account balance. Credit cards, on the other hand, allow you to borrow money up to an established credit limit and pay it off in installments.  Credit card payments typically incur an interest charge, while debit card purchases are not subject to interest. Credit cards often provide rewards and other special benefits, while debit cards do not. Finally, debit cards are generally accepted by fewer merchants than credit cards.",
