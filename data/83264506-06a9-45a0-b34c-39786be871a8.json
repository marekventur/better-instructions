  "output": "An analogy that illustrates the concept of a feedback loop could be that of a snowball rolling down a hill. As the snowball rolls and gains in size, it leaves a circular trail behind it, which then feeds back into the snowball and increases its size, allowing it to roll further and larger down the hill. This is much like a feedback loop, where the output of a process loop back in to become the input for the process, thereby creating a continuous, cyclical effect.",
