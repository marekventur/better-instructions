  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the two types of philosophical ethics - deontological and utilitarian.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Deontological ethics, or duty-based ethics, emphasizes adherence to a set of universal moral standards and principles, regardless of the consequences. Utilitarian ethics, or consequence-based ethics, emphasizes actions that will produce the greatest good for the greatest number of people. However, both approaches recognize that moral decision making involves an inherent risk of harm and uncertainty. Deontology focuses more on individual behavior and the importance of adhering to one\u2019s ethical duties, while utilitarianism focuses more on the external consequences of an action and the potential benefits it can bring to society. Ultimately, both systems seek to maximize the greatest good for everyone affected by the decision.",
