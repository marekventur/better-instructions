  "input": "",
  "output": "Two ways to optimize a query in a database are to use indexing and to use query optimization techniques. Indexing allows the query to locate data more quickly by creating an index of the data to be searched, while query optimization techniques involve rewrite and restructuring the query to increase efficiency by using techniques such as the ordering of join operations, using the most restrictive predicates first, and avoiding redundant operations.",
