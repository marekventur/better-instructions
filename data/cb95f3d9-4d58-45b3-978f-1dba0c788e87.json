  "output": "Cleaning a windowsill requires a few simple steps. Begin by dusting the surface of the windowsill with a feather duster or a microfiber cloth. Then, spray the windowsill with a window cleaner or a mild cleaning solution and wipe the surface down with a damp cloth. Make sure to pay special attention to the corners and crevices of the windowsill. If there is any stubborn dirt or grime, create a paste of baking soda and water and scrub the windowsill with a soft brush or sponge. Rinse the windowsill with a clean cloth and allow it to air dry.",
