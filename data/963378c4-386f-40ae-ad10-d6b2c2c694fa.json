  "input": "",
  "output": "Glacial retreat is the process by which glaciers shrink due to melting or other factors. The two main causes of glacial retreat are rising global temperatures due to climate change, and an increase in the amount of glacial melt water entering the oceans. As global temperatures continue to rise, glaciers are melting at a faster rate and less snow is falling in the winter, which leads to glaciers shrinking. Additionally, the melting caused by warm ocean currents can destabilize glaciers and cause them to calve and retreat.",
