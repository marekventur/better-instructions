  "input": "",
  "output": "An effective way to reduce pollution in developing countries would be to implement a comprehensive and effective pollution control system. This would involve targeting the main sources of pollution, such as factories and automobiles, and enacting laws and regulations to reduce their output of air and water pollution. Additionally, the adoption of clean energy sources and the promotion of green initiatives, such as public transportation and renewable energy, can also reduce pollution levels in these countries.",
