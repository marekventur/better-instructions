  "input": "",
  "output": "A virtual reality (VR) system is a computer-simulated environment that simulates physical presence in places in the real world or imagined worlds. It uses special digital equipment and devices, such as headsets, gloves, goggles, and sensors, to interact with and manipulate 3-D environments. VR immerses the user in an environment that can be manipulated and explored with natural movements, helping them to experience a sense of presence in a virtual world.",
