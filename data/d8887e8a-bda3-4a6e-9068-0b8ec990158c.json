  "instruction": "Compose a melody that expresses sadness.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The melody begins with a slow and somber opening with a descending line in the keys of C and F. The second phrase introduces minor harmonic progressions which slowly unfold in a subtle yet foreboding manner. This serves to slowly build up to a more intense moment, where flourishes of chromaticism and syncopations create a furioso feeling in a heightened atmosphere of dissonance. This leads to a final phrase which slowly diminishes, carrying a sense of sadness and resignation in the echoing of the harmonies, ultimately leading to a gentle resolution.",
