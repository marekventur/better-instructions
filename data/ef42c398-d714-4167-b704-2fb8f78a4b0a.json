  "instruction": "Create a user interface for a chatbot",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The user interface for a chatbot should have a way for the user to submit queries to the chatbot, as well as provide a way for the chatbot to respond. A simple text-based interface is the most common method, but graphical user interfaces (GUIs) can also be employed. The interface should also be able to convey basic information related to the chatbot, such as its purpose and available features. For advanced chatbots, such as those that use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the interface should also be able to capture metaphor and subtlety, as well as context and intent.",
