  "output": "Solar energy is a clean and renewable energy source that offers a variety of advantages over other energy sources. First, it is a clean source of energy that does not produce any greenhouse gases or other pollutants. Solar energy also does not require a lot of maintenance and does not need to be constantly replenished like some other sources, such as natural gas or coal. Additionally, solar energy has a low cost of installation and can be used in remote areas that do not have access to other energy sources. Finally, solar energy is becoming increasingly efficient, with some solar panels now producing roughly the same amount of energy as traditional fossil fuel sources. Overall, solar energy is a viable and cost-effective alternative to conventional energy sources.",
