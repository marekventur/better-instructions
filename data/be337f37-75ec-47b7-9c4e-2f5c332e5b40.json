  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a tortoise and a turtle is that a tortoise is a land-dwelling animal, while a turtle can live in either water or on land. Tortoises have large, sturdy feet that are designed for walking on land, while turtles have flippers that make them better adapted for swimming in the water. Additionally, the shells of turtles are generally more streamlined, while tortoises have more dome-like shells.",
