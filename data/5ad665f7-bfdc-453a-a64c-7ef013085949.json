  "output": "An environmental issue that has been in the news recently is the melting of the Arctic sea ice. The melting of the Arctic sea ice is a huge problem because it affects global temperatures, weather patterns, and ocean levels. It also can lead to the death of many species that live in or near the Arctic, such as polar bears, seals, and walruses. Since this is a global issue, it is important that every country takes part in understanding and mitigating the effects of Arctic sea ice melting.",
