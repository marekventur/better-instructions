  "input": "",
  "output": "A machine learning algorithm is like an instructor that helps a computer learn. Just like how a kid learns how to count, a computer can also learn how to do it - except it is much faster than humans. The instructions are in the form of a set of rules that the computer follows to learn a new skill or find patterns in data.",
