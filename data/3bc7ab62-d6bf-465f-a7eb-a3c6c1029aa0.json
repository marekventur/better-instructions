  "input": "",
  "output": "AI can be used to detect online harassment by identifying potentially toxic language and keywords used in social media comments or posts. AI can also be used to analyze the tone and sentiment of a message to determine if it is likely to be harassing or abusive. AI-powered solutions can be implemented to monitor conversations and alert moderators of suspicious activity, allowing them to intervene before an incident escalates. Additionally, AI can be trained to recognize patterns of harassing behavior and identify repeat offenders, allowing for faster and more effective action to be taken.",
