  "output": "Genetic engineering is a term used to describe the various process by which genes and their associated traits (e.g. diseases, physical characteristics) are manipulated in organisms. Through these methods, scientists are able to change the genetic makeup of organisms and alter their characteristics, including their growth rates, hardiness, color, and other traits. This is done by cloning, in which scientists insert carefully chosen and edited pieces of DNA from one organism into another, allowing scientists to develop new forms of organisms that contain desired traits. This process has been increasingly used in research, medicine, and food production.",
