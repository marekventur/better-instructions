  "output": "The Peloponnesian War was an two-decade long conflict between the two major Greek powers of the time \u2013 Athens and Sparta. It began in 431 BC as a result of deep-seated rivalry between the two cities and ended in 404 BC when Athens' navy was destroyed by the Spartans. In between, Sparta had the upper hand, but both sides experienced periods of victory and played off one another, taking turns to gain the upper hand. The war saw strategies, tactics and siege warfare employed on a larger scale than ever before, and turned out to be a major event in Greek history.",
