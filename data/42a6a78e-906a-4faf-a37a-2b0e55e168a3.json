  "output": "Two components of a scientific experiment are a control group and a sample size. The control group is a group that does not receive any treatment or intervention and is used to provide a comparison for the experimental group. The sample size is the number of individuals or objects included in the study. It is important to have a large enough sample size to ensure valid results, but not so large that the experiment becomes too costly or time consuming.",
