  "input": "",
  "output": "A software bug has a negative impact on the customer experience, as it can cause the system to crash or the data to become corrupted. This can cause inconvenience to customers, as the software is no longer usable for its intended purpose. In some cases, the issue may not be immediately noticed and customers may not know that the system is broken until they notice that something isn't working correctly. This can lose trust from customers and lead to a decline in customer satisfaction.",
