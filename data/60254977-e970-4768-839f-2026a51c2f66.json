  "input": "",
  "output": "Cloud computing is a model of computing in which remote computing resources are delivered to users over the internet. It operates in a distributed computing environment where users do not need to maintain their own physical hardware, such as servers, and can access computing resources as if it were a utility over the internet. Through cloud computing, users can access applications, data storage, and computing power on an as-needed basis.",
