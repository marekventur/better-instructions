  "output": "In the middle of a dark woods, a fire burned brightly, illuminating the gnarled trees and casting long shadows over the still night. Staring into the glow, there stood a woman, cloaked in a velvet cloak and wearing a crown of daisies in her hair. She had traveled far this night, following a whisper in her dreams; a whisper that had led her to a clearing deep in the forest. With evocation of ancient magics, she whispered a spell into the flames, and with it awoke the spirits of the forest. One by one the trees moved, the branches reaching out to entwine the woman in a warm embrace, sharing with her secrets of a forgotten magics. The whiter light of the morning sun awoke the woman from her trance, breathing new life into her and the forest around her.",
