  "input": "",
  "output": "The general process of writing code begins with planning and design. Programmers will consider the requirements of the task and research potential solutions. Next, they will develop the code, usually by writing short snippets of code and testing them. Once the code has been written, it is usually tested, debugged, and modified as needed. Finally, the code is then integrated into a larger system for use in production.",
