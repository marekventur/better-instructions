  "output": "Cooperative competition is the concept of working together in competition with one another to achieve a mutually beneficial goal. It involves establishing an understanding that each participant will benefit from the efforts of the other participants in achieving a common goal. It is different from regular competition in that each competitor is conscious of the need for others to succeed and is willing to work together in order to benefit all parties.",
