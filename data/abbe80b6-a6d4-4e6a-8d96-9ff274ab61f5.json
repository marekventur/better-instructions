  "input": "",
  "output": "The American Revolution and the French Revolution had several comparable features. Both revolutions championed the causes of popular sovereignty and the popular participation of citizens in the governance of their societies. Additionally, ideas of natural rights, individual liberties, and the inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness influenced both revolutions.\n\nHowever, there were also several differences between the two revolutions. The American Revolution primarily aimed to break away from British rule and was largely driven by the American colonists while the French Revolution had many more causes and aimed to overthrow the monarchy and the entire Ancien Regime. The French Revolution was also significantly more extreme than the American Revolution and had a more radical and violent end. The American Revolution maintained many of the same people in government while the French Revolution pushed them out. The aftermath of each revolution had different effects as well - the American Revolution led to the founding of a new nation, while the French Revolution led to a period of instability and terror.",
