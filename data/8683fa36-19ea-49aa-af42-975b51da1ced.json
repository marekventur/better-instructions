  "output": "Dear Friend, \n\nI recently had a really bad experience that I wanted to tell you about. I met up with someone I had been talking to online for a few weeks, and it was a huge mistake. We had dinner at a restaurant and it was so awkward. I felt so uncomfortable the entire time and was relieved when it was finally over.\n\nIt goes to show that even if someone seems nice online, it doesn't always translate into real life interactions. It was a tough lesson to learn, but thankfully I made it out with only a bruised ego. \n\nI'll be more cautious the next time around.\n\nTake care,\n[Your Name]",
