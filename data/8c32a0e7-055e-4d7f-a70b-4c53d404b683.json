  "output": "The ideal outdoor workout includes a combination of cardio and strength training. Begin with light cardio activities like jogging, biking, or brisk walking to warm up your muscles and increase your heart rate. Follow this with strength training exercises such as push-ups, squats, and sit-ups. Incorporate dynamic stretches to increase mobility and flexibility. Finish with a 5-10 minute cool down to slowly decrease your heart rate and help your muscles relax. Additionally, make sure to drink plenty of fluids and listen to your body\u2019s cues.",
