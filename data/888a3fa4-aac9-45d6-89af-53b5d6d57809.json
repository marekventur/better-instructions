  "input": "",
  "output": "My new programming language is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn. It is object-oriented and allows developers to create complex applications quickly and easily. It has powerful syntax that makes it possible to write complex algorithms in fewer lines of code. It also supports multiple language paradigms, so it is perfect for different types of programming tasks. It has a built-in package manager and debugging tool, making it easy to manage applications and troubleshoot errors.",
