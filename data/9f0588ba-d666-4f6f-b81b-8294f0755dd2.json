  "output": "In the meadow of soft green,\nThe summer breezes softly sing.\nButterflies kiss tender blooms.\nDrifting over the meadow like an endless tune.\n\nThe meadow is alive with laughter and chirps,\nWhere larks, hares, and otters frolic amongst small saplings and firps.\nThe songs of spring echo in the valley,\nThe secrets of the meadow lie in waiting for discovery.\n\nThe meadow shimmers with the heat of the sun,\nSoftly shifting and stretching until the day is done.\nThe tranquil sound of a babbling brook\nEchoes through the meadow, a soothing echo like a sweet song as it looks.\n\nThe meadow is a magical place,\nWhere time stands still and children take space.\nAs nightfall sets in, the fireflies appear.\nTransforming the meadow and calming the fears.",
