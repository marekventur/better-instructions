  "instruction": "Build a bridge between two islands.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The bridge should be designed with the correct engineering and materials. Considerations should include the size and weight of the bridge, the location of the two islands, environmental factors, and the types of materials best suited for construction in the given location. For example, a floating bridge is best suited for watery areas, while a steel bridge is recommended for areas with higher traffic. Careful planning, engineering, and construction will help ensure the bridge is secure, safe, and durable.",
