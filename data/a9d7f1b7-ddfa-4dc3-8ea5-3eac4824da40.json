  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a blacksmith who loved to make things out of metal and wood. He had a hammer and an anvil, and he was very skilled at his craft. One day, he came across a piece of wood that was unlike any other he had seen. He figured he could make something special out of it, so he took his hammer and anvil and set to work. After many hours of crafting, the wood took on an incredible shape - a bird! The blacksmith was amazed and proud of his work, and thus he learnt the importance of taking time to craft even the most mundane materials.",
