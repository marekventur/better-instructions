  "instruction": "Explain the firing process for a company that has less than 10 people.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "For a business with less than 10 employees, the firing process should be handled carefully and thoughtfully. It should begin with a discussion between the employer and the employee about the reason for the termination or dismissal. It is important to be compassionate, clear, and professional during this process. The employer should also give the employee an appropriate amount of time to gather documents and personal items, unless security reasons dictate otherwise. Finally, the employer should provide the employee with a final document that outlines the details of the termination.",
