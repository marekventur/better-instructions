  "output": "Value investing is an investment philosophy that focuses on selecting stocks that are trading for less than their intrinsic value. This is in contrast to investing strategies like growth investing, which focus on purchasing stocks that are expected to appreciate in value. Value investors look for bargains in order to maximize returns, and use a variety of analysis methods to determine the intrinsic value of a stock before investing in it.",
