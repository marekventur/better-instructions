  "instruction": "Given the following synopsis, what is the moral lesson of this story?",
  "input": "Once upon a time, there was a poor young boy who wanted some candy. He begged his father for money to buy it, but his father said no and ordered him to go to bed. As he was going to bed, the boy saw a five-dollar bill on the counter, which he took and bought the candy.",
  "output": "The moral lesson of this story is that taking what doesn't belong to you is wrong, and it will always come at a cost in the end. The boy in the story learned that when he took the five-dollar bill, he still did not get the candy he wanted, and he instead faced the consequences of his actions. He also risked, and likely lost his father's trust. Ultimately, it's better to accept \u2018no\u2019 and have integrity than to take what isn't yours and suffer the consequences of your actions.",
