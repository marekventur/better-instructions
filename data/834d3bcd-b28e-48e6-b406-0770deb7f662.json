  "input": "",
  "output": "Neural networks can be used to recognize handwriting by training the network with a large set of labeled examples of written words. The neural network analyzes the examples and learns the features that differentiate written characters and words, such as shape and size. Once trained, the network can then be used to predict the characters in a handwritten word or phrase.",
