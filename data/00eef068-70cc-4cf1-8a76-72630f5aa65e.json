  "output": "Breathing is the process by which oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is expelled from the lungs. The process begins with inhalation, where oxygen-rich air is taken in through the nose or mouth and travels through the trachea to the lungs. Here, oxygen is absorbed into the blood and carbon dioxide is released from the blood into the alveoli, small air sacs in the lungs. During exhalation, the air from the alveoli is expelled out of the lungs and through the trachea back out of the body.",
