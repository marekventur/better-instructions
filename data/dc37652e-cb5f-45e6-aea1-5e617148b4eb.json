  "input": "",
  "output": "Generally, conservatives are in favor of implementing the death penalty as they consider it to be an effective form of retribution and punishment for those who have committed serious crimes. Liberals, on the other hand, are more likely to oppose the death penalty as they view it as a violation of the Eighth Amendment and believe that other forms of punishment are more humane.",
