  "input": "",
  "output": "My favorite makeup look is a bold and glamourous look. I like to start with a clean and moisturized face. Then doing a smokey eye, with a warm brown all over the lid and blending it out, while adding more brown to the outer V of the eye. I then add glittery shadows to enhance the look and make it pop. I finish with a voluminous mascara and a bold red lip.",
