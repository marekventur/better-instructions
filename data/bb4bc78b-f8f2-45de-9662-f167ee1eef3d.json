The core teachings are known as the Four Noble Truths, which are the truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the end of suffering, and the truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering. Buddhism also emphasizes the use of meditation and mindfulness to become more aware of the present moment and work towards enlightenment.",
