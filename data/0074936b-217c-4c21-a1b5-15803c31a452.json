From digital textbooks to virtual classrooms, technology has revolutionized the way students learn and interact with their teachers in the classroom. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we have witnessed advancements in educational technology offerings such as personalized learning, adaptive systems and predictive analytics. Technology has enabled educators to provide instruction in a more focused, effective, and versatile manner, while providing students the tools they need to gain the skills and knowledge they need to become successful in their future. From the ability to research quickly and efficiently to the ability to network with professionals and academics from around the world, the benefits of technology in the classroom are undeniable. \n\nTechnology can also improve the delivery and quality of education by providing students with more options for assessment, feedback and collaboration. With online assessments and simulations, educators can provide students with more varied forms of assessment, allowing them to demonstrate their understanding of content in a more meaningful way. Additionally, technology aids teachers in tracking student\u2019s performance in real-time and responding faster to any deficiencies or areas of improvement. \n\nFinally, technology has helped to reduce the barriers to education. With access to the Internet, students from all socio-economic backgrounds can now access course materials and resources at their own convenience, making learning accessible and affordable for everyone.\n\nOverall, technology has been a powerful tool to improve the quality of education and to bridge the gap between different students\u2019 socio-economic backgrounds. As technology advances, the possibilities for further improvements in the delivery of education become endless.",
