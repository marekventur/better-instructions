  "input": "",
  "output": "Ocean acidification affects marine life by decreasing the availability of carbonate ions, which makes it harder for shell-forming animals like corals and oysters to form their shells and skeletons. This can lead to decreased growth, decreased spawning of young, increased mortality among young, and shifts in species composition of certain communities.",
