  "output": "The mitochondria is an important part of the cell because it is the site of the major energy-producing process of the cell. It is responsible for the breakdown of nutrients such as glucose and converts them into ATP, the energy source for all other reactions. In addition, it helps regulate the cell\u2019s pH levels, temperature, and many metabolic processes. It also plays a role in cell growth and cell death.",
