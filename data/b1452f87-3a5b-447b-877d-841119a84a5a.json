  "instruction": "Analyze the way the American media portrays politics.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The American media generally portrays politics in a negative light. News coverage is often focused on the negative aspects of politics and the political process. It often ignores the positive impacts of policy decisions and tends to distort the actual picture of politics \u2013 often displaying it as a circus of corruption and dysfunction. This depiction of politics can be damaging, as it encourages citizens to think of politicians and those in power as adversaries rather than potential partners or problem solvers.",
