  "input": "France and Germany",
  "output": "France and Germany are two different countries in Europe with different political systems. In France, the government is an integrated republic with a semi-presidential system and a bicameral legislature. Meanwhile, Germany\u2019s is based on the Basic Law of 1949, which is a constitutional democracy with a federal system and a bicameral legislature. Both countries have parliamentary systems, although Germany is more decentralized with individual states playing a more active role in policy-making. France also has a more centralized government with a higher degree of control over legislation, but Germany features more direct democracy with citizens able to vote on certain policies and initiatives. Both countries maintain a strong civil society and offer the protection of civil liberties.",
