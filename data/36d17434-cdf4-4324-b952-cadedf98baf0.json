  "input": "",
  "output": "The United Kingdom is a unitary state, meaning its government holds the vast majority of its political power, while the US is a federal system, with political power spread out across multiple levels of government.  In the UK, the central government enacts laws and manages economic policy, and local authorities are largely responsible for the day-to-day running of public services.  In the US, this is reversed, with states having their own separate government and the federal government having a limited role in those areas.  Additionally, the UK does not have a written constitution, while in the US the Constitution is the supreme legal document and acts as a check on the power of the three branches of government.",
