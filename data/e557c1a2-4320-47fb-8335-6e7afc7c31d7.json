  "input": "",
  "output": "In-person interviews are important in the job hiring process because they provide a more comprehensive assessment of a candidate\u2019s qualifications and personality. During an in-person interview, employers can evaluate body language, communication skills, and other intangible qualities that may get lost over video or phone calls. In addition, employers can ask personalized questions that can help them better determine whether or not a candidate is the best fit for the position. Face-to-face interactions are also essential in developing the employer-candidate relationship and making sure that the candidate is comfortable and excited about working for the company. As such, interviewing job candidates in person is essential for having a thorough understanding of the candidate and his or her qualifications.",
