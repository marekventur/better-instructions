  "input": "",
  "output": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on travel and transportation. Governments and health organizations around the world have imposed various restrictions on travel, which has resulted in a drastic decrease in air travel and other forms of transportation. Airlines in particular are significantly affected as people have stopped travelling for fear of exposure to the virus. \nIt is also expected that these restrictions and travel decreases will have a long-term effect on the economy. There is a possibility of airline bankruptcies, cable car lines and train routes closing, and businesses such as hotels, restaraunts, and tourism companies suffering. Additionally, the pandemic could potentially lead to the introduction of new travel regulations and impact the future of international travel.",
