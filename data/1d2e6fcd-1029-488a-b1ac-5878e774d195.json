  "output": "The use of single-use plastics is an unsustainable and damaging practice that should be discouraged. These plastics are not biodegradable, and therefore end up polluting and clogging landfills or the natural environment. Additionally, their production requires the use of resources such as oil, water, and energy, resulting in environmental degradation and consumption of our limited natural resources.",
