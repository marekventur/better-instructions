  "input": "",
  "output": "Visual learners and auditory learners are two common types of learning styles. Visual learners prefer to learn by seeing information either through diagrams, charts, or pictures. Auditory learners prefer to learn by listening, such as being auditory present in a lecture or seminar. Visual learners tend to receive and remember information best by seeing it, whereas auditory learners tend to remember information best by hearing it. Additionally, visual learners are often able to decode abstract concepts quickly, while auditory learners are better able to process and recall information in a linear and logical manner.",
