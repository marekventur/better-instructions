  "instruction": "Based on the article, explain how the hospitalization rate of COVID-19 affects the mortality rate.",
  "input": "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mortality-rate-of-covid-19",
  "output": "The hospitalization rate of COVID-19 has a significant impact on the mortality rate. A high hospitalization rate means that more people are being hospitalized for the virus, which can negatively impact mortality rates. This is because those who fall sick with COVID-19 and become critically ill may require intensive care and lifesaving treatments in a hospital setting, and the mortality rate is higher with more serious illness. Conversely, a low hospitalization rate can lead to a lower mortality rate. As medical technology advances and individuals have access to better treatment options, hospitalization rates and mortality rates can decrease.",
