  "instruction": "Describe the similarities between decision trees and random forests.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Decision trees and random forests are both supervised machine learning models that are used for classification problems. Both models use a tree-like structure to make decisions. In a decision tree, each node is a decision point and the model descends down the tree until it reaches a leaf node, which is the prediction. A random forest is similar, but instead of a single decision tree, it includes multiple decision trees trained on slightly different data and combined together. The result is a better prediction model with improved accuracy and reduced overfitting.",
