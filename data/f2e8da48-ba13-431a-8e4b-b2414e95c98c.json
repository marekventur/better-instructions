  "output": "Alice stared out of the window of her small apartment and sighed. She had moved to the city with dreams of starting a new life, but after months of searching for a job that could pay the rent and cover the bills, she was starting to feel like a failure. A sharp knock on the door broke her train of thought and she hesitantly opened it to find a tall, imposing man standing outside her door. His face was hidden in the shadows of his hood, but she could see his piercing eyes looking her up and down with a suspicious expression. Alice felt an inexplicable thrill of excitement and she knew that her life was about to change.",
