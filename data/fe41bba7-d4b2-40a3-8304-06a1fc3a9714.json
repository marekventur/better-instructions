  "input": "",
  "output": "A situation when candor is expected might be when an employee is in a performance review. The employee should be honest and forthright in how they assess their own performance, as well as how they believe the employer's expectations and feedback could be improved. Additionally, this could also be applicable when resolving a conflict with a colleague. Candor is necessary in order to ensure a meaningful and productive discussion.",
