  "output": "Error handling is an important part of software development. It is used to anticipate the errors that could occur in a program and provide an appropriate response in the event of such an error. Error handling typically involves detecting an error, recording the error's specific details such as the time of occurrence and the type of error, and responding to the error by displaying an appropriate message and/or taking corrective action where possible. It is important for software developers to be aware of the different types of errors that can occur and to design the application to handle them appropriately.",
