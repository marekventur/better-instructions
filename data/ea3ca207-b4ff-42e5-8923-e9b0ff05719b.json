  "output": "Hybrid cars are vehicles that use both petrol and electricity as a source of power. They typically have a combustion engine, electric motor and battery to provide a more efficient and cleaner driving experience. Hybrid cars are designed to maximize fuel economy and minimize emissions, allowing them to produce fewer exhaust gases than a petrol or diesel vehicle. They are also designed to provide a smoother and quieter ride than a traditional car. Hybrid cars have become increasingly popular due to their higher fuel efficiency and lower emissions, making them an attractive choice for environmentally conscious drivers.",
