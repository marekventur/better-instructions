  "input": "",
  "output": "In \"The Lottery\" by Shirley Jackson, the use of symbolism reflects how blindly obedient and conformist society can often be. The lottery itself is a symbol of tradition, but its dark connotations signify danger and malevolence. The stones symbolize the idea of mob mentality and the danger of groupthink. The box itself serves as a symbol of lasting tradition, a relic of religious sacrifices and a reminder of the intensity of the lottery ritual.",
