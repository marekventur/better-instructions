  "input": "",
  "output": "Type A personalities are characterized by a strong tendency toward competitiveness, achievement, impatience, and a need to be in control. On the other hand, Type B personalities are characterized by relaxed attitudes towards goals, a low level of competitiveness, and the ability to take things as they come. \n\nBoth personalities share a desire to succeed and a strong work ethic, but they differ in how they go about accomplishing their goals. Type A individuals may feel a need to do everything themselves and are likely to work more intensely and efficiently on tasks, while Type B individuals tend to be more relaxed and seek help from others. Type A personalities tend to be more impatient and frustrated with delays, while Type B individuals are more patient and tolerant of ambiguity and change.",
