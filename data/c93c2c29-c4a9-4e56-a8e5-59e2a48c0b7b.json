  "output": "The sun is out and the snow is gone,\nThe flowers bloom with a beautiful song.\nThe birds sing and the bees are buzzing,\nThe world awaikes from its winter snoozing.\nSwirling petals fall from the trees,\nBrightening up the grass and the breeze.\nThe bonfire crackles and the campfire smiles,\nLife has returned in full file.",
