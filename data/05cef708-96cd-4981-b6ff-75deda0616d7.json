  "input": "",
  "output": "Visual learners typically prefer to learn by seeing visual aids such as diagrams, charts, and illustrations. They are often able to remember information quickly and accurately. Auditory learners, on the other hand, prefer to learn by hearing information. They may be better able to remember sequences of verbal instructions, and they prefer activities like lectures, debates and discussion groups. Both learning styles can be effective, but some learners may have a preference for one or the other.",
