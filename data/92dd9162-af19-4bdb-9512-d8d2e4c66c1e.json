  "input": "",
  "output": "Physical storage devices, such as hard drives, offer larger storage capacities and faster transfer speeds, however they require physical space and access to an appropriate power source. Digital storage devices, such as cloud storage or USB drives, are more portable and often less expensive for large amounts of data storage, but the transfer rates are slower, and access to the data requires an Internet connection.",
