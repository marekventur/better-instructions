  "output": "Vector multiplication, also known as the dot product, is an operation that allows two vectors to be multiplied together. It is a scalar product meaning it only produces a scalar result and not another vector. The operation works by taking two vectors of equal dimension and multiplying the corresponding terms together and then summing them together. This can be done by hand but is easily accomplished with a calculator. Vector multiplication is useful in physics, calculus, engineering, and a variety of other fields where directional forces are measured.",
