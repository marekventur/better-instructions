  "input": "",
  "output": "In a socialist state, the primary economic goal is to ensure that goods and services are produced and distributed in an equitable manner, rather than driven by the principles of market competition. This is achieved through public ownership and/or management of resources, which often includes the redistribution of wealth through progressive taxation and public services. The emphasis is on collective, rather than individual, well-being.",
