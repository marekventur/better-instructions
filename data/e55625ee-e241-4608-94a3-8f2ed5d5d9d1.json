  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a small bird who was feeling lonely and sad. He had no friends and felt like the world was against him.\n\nOne day, the bird overheard two other birds talking about a magical place in the forest. He decided to go and look for it, hoping that he would find happiness.\n\nHe searched for days, eventually becoming exhausted and disheartened. Just when he was about to give up, he spotted a beautiful lake with a small island in the middle.\n\nHe flew to the island and, to his surprise, saw many other birds of different shapes and sizes. He was welcomed by them, laughing and playing together.\n\nHe made many friends and was no longer sad or lonely. For the first time in his life, he felt content and at peace.",
