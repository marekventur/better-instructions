  "input": "",
  "output": "Hydrogen and helium are both noble gases, meaning they do not react with other substances. However, hydrogen is lighter and more reactive than helium, with a boiling and melting point of -253.15 \u00b0C and 14.01 K respectively. Helium is the most abundant element in the universe and has a much higher boiling and melting point of -268.930 \u00b0C and 4.15 K respectively.",
