  "output": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on how a person\u2019s thoughts, beliefs and attitudes influence their behavior. CBT is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of approaches which all recognize that a person\u2019s thoughts and beliefs can affect their behavior and their emotions. CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts create our feelings and our feelings create our behaviors. CBT is problem focused, meaning that the therapist and the client work together to identify and address problem areas in the person\u2019s life. The goal of CBT is to help the person learn new and better ways of dealing with problems and with negative thoughts and feelings. It is a short-term therapy with a goal of helping the client identify, challenge and change patterns of thinking and behavior that are causing problems in their life.",
