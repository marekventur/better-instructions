  "output": "The taxonomy of animals is the set of rules that separates species of animals into groups. Animals are classified according to their distinct characteristics and evolutionary relationships. The taxonomic hierarchy consists of seven major categories: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. These categories are then further divided into subcategories to provide more accurate classification. For example, the scientific name of a lion is Panthera leo, which is broken down into the kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Carnivora, family Felidae, genus Panthera and species leo.",
