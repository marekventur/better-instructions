  "input": "",
  "output": "The human foot has 26 bones, which are divided into three categories: tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges. The tarsals form the heel and midfoot, and consist of the calcaneus, talus, cuboid, navicular, and three cuneiform bones. The metatarsals form the bridge of the foot and consist of five long bones. Finally, the phalanges are 14 long, small bones that make up the toes.",
