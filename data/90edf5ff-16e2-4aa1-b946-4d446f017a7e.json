  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to use technology to conserve energy is to install and use energy-efficient appliances. These types of appliances use less energy to perform the same task, which can reduce energy consumption and bills. For example, LED lightbulbs use up to 75% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs, and modern dishwashers use about half the amount of water and energy of a traditional model.",
