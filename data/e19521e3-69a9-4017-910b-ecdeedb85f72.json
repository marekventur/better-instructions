  "output": "Using a computer for university assignments is beneficial for many reasons. Computers enable students to find information quickly and accurately from a wide variety of reliable sources. There are online databases and research tools available on computers to help students find the information they need for their assignments. Using a computer can also help with time management and organization of course work. One can easily create a plan of action, set up deadlines, and maintain a good level of efficiency working on their assignments. Additionally, computers allow students to stay in touch with classmates and professors, allowing a student to collaborate to produce better quality assignments.  Computers also enable students to access lectures and course materials anytime, anywhere. Database management and presentation software can be used to easily create professional-looking documents, images, presentations, and websites. Last but not least, computers help save time and energy by removing the burden of lengthy tasks such as taking notes or calculations.",
