  "input": "",
  "output": "Since 2011, there has been ongoing civil unrest in Syria resulting from the Syrian Civil War, currently in its 10th year. The war is being fought between the current Syrian government, opposition forces, and numerous different jihadist organizations, mainly ISIS and Al-Qaeda's formerly-affiliated Nusra Front. The unrest has resulted in massive displacement of the Syrian people, with more than 6 million people internally displaced and more than 5 million becoming refugees in other countries. The conflict has resulted in widespread human rights violations and in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths, as well as economic collapse and infrastructure destruction.",
