  "input": "John, a computer, New York",
  "output": "John was the proud owner of a computer, the newest and greatest model on the market. He had been dying to try it out, so he made his way to New York and hooked up the device. Immediately upon flipping the switch, it began to rain. It seemed as if the computer had summoned the rain in order to test out John\u2019s new machine. As the rain poured, John began to type away and watched as his laptop lit up with the pouring water high above Manhattan. He created an entire virtual world in mere moments, and the rain seemed weary and eventually stopped, allowing John to take the computer for a walk around the city in order to show off his creation.",
