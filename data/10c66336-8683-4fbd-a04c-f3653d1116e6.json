  "input": "",
  "output": "GPT-3 is a large-scale autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to generate human-like text. It is trained on a massive amount of unstructured text data, which it then uses to generate contextually relevant text. GPT-3 incorporates attention mechanisms, allowing it to capture complex relationships between words and phrases. This enables GPT-3 to generate high-quality text that is relevant to the context it was provided.",
