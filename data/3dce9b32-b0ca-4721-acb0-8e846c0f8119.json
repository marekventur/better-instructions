  "input": "",
  "output": "The limitations of machine learning algorithms include the need for large datasets to train the algorithms and the potential for overfitting, where algorithms become overly complex and unable to generalize beyond the training dataset. Additionally, a lack of transparency in the algorithms can make it difficult to understand why a certain decision was made and to debug the algorithm when things don\u2019t go as planned. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms can be computationally expensive and require a large amount of time and resources.",
