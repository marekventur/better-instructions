  "input": "",
  "output": "Online reviews have the potential to influence consumer behavior in a variety of ways. Positive reviews can boost a product's reputation, leading to increased sales and customer loyalty. Conversely, negative reviews can deter customers from purchasing a product, as they are more likely to trust the opinion of other customers than a company's own description. Online reviews can even shape customers' expectations, setting the bar higher for other options and steering customers in a certain direction.",
