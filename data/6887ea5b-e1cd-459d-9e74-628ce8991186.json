  "input": "",
  "output": "Carbohydrates are broken down in the body by a process called digestion. Digestion starts in the mouth when carbohydrates are chewed and broken down by saliva. In the stomach, the carbohydrates are further broken down by enzymes and acids. After being broken down further in the small intestine, the carbohydrates are absorbed into the bloodstream and the breakdown process is completed in the liver and other tissues, where the carbohydrates are converted into energy.",
