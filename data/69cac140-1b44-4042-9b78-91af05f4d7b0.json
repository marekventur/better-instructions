  "output": "Over the last century, the Earth's climate has been greatly affected by human activities. Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, largely caused by burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, have increased the Earth's average surface temperature. This has led to a number of far-reaching climate changes, including more frequent and intense heat waves, greater sea level rise, a decrease in surface ozone, and increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These changes have had serious impacts on food production, human health, biodiversity, the environment, and the global economy.",
