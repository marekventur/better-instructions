  "input": "",
  "output": "Blockchain technology is important because it enables users to securely exchange digital assets, like currencies, contracts, or records, on a decentralized, tamper-resistant, and immutable digital ledger. This distributed ledger technology allows users to make secure transactions without the need for a third-party intermediary, which provides greater privacy and freedom compared to traditional centralized systems.
