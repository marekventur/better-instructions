  "input": "",
  "output": "An example of a test scenario that a company should do with respect to the security of a system is to conduct a simulated cyber-attack and assess how the system responds. The simulated attack should cover a variety of potential threats from external attackers, such as SQL injection attempts and brute force attacks. The response to these simulated threats should be monitored and assessed for effectiveness. This would allow the company to identify any vulnerabilities in the system and take steps to address them.",
