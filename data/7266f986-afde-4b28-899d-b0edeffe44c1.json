  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between an AI-enabled machine and a human worker is in their ability to process quickly, store and analyze information, and take independent decisions. AI-enabled machines are capable of quickly handling large amounts of data, analyzing and recognizing patterns from it, and making decisions based on that data. Human workers, on the other hand, are capable of using their intuition and experience to come up with creative solutions to problems, and process information in a more nuanced and contextual way. Whereas AI-enabled machines may be efficient and accurate, humans possess the quality of creativity and ingenuity.",
