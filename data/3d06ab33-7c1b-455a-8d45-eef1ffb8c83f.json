  "input": "",
  "output": "Whales and dolphins belong to the order Cetartiodactyla because they share common traits, such as their body structure and bone structure, with other even-toed ungulates, both aquatic and terrestrial, that also belong to the order. This suggests that they are descended from a common ancestor and form a single group within the order Cetartiodactyla.",
