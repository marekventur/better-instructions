  "input": "\"The evidence is clear: Everyone who dislikes coffee is wrong.\"",
  "output": "This statement is an example of the ad hominem logical fallacy. Ad hominem is a type of argumentative tactic that focuses on attacking the character or motivations of an individual instead of addressing the issue at hand. By asserting that anyone who dislikes coffee is wrong, this statement ignores the individual's reasons for not liking coffee, and instead focuses on the person themselves.",
