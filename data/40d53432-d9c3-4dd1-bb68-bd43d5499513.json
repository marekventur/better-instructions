  "output": "The steps to solving a system of linear equations include:\n1. Define the variables and rearrange the equations so that the coefficient of one variable is the same in each equation.\n2. Multiply both sides of each equation by the coefficients in order to eliminate the coefficients of the other variables.\n3. Solve for the variables by combining the equations. \n4. Check the solution by Substituting the solution back into each of the equations and verifying that the results are correct.",
