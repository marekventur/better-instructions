  "output": "Verse 1:\nComputers made life easier than ever before\nIt opened up a world of possibilities for sure\nFrom finding information to conducting businesses\nThose digital devices have us living like geniuses\n\nVerse 2:\nWe use them day and night all around the world\nRun programs, watch movies and be a part of the real-world\nUpload pictures, chat with friends, play virtual games\nWithout them, life would never have been the same\n\nVerse 3:\nFrom classrooms to work-spaces, they've created an evolution\nFrom video-calling to blogging, it's an endless revolution\nCommunication, information, storage and storage too\nComputers are here to do whatever we ask, it's true\n\nVerse 4:\nWe need to be aware that the problems can arise\nCrash our systems, crash our lives and make us unwise\nWe need to be careful with whom we talk and what we share\nLest our online security becomes our ultimate nightmare\n\nVerse 5:\nSo, don't be fooled, don't be quick, use your common sense\nYou're responsible for what happens and for your own defense\nKnow about the risks, and protect yourself with caution\nScammers, hackers, viruses, you should all fear like daimon\n\nVerse 6:\nAll that said, the power of computers is undeniable\nHelping us better understand the world is undeniable\nIt's made our lives easier and more manageable\nSo, let's use them wisely and be more sensible\n\nVerse 7:\nGo get the facts, do your research, ask the right questions\nTake care of your device, keep it away from infections\nFrom malware to ransomware, viruses and Trojans\nYou need to be alert, don't fall prey to any demons \n\nVerse 8:\nYes, it pays to be careful and mindful of cyber threats \nKeep your computer updated, use strong passwords and never forget\nTo back up your data in order to survive\nThese are the lessons to learn when it comes to staying alive.",
