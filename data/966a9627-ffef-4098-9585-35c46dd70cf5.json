  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary difference between a web developer and a software developer is that web developers typically focus on developing websites, while software developers focus on building computer programs. Web developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies to develop websites, while software developers use programming languages such as Java and C# to develop applications. Additionally, software developers often have a deeper understanding of computer science and algorithms, while web developers may have a more limited understanding of software engineering principles.",
