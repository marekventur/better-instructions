  "output": "Fries, a treat that often brings great joy,\nAdding a salty flavor to girls and boys.\nA crunchy delight that is hard to ignore,\nIt makes your smile stretch from floor to door.\n\nSprinkled with salt, usually dusted with pepper,\nSome people never want french fries to sever.\nFrom steak fries to waffle ones small or large,\nEasy to munch and make you charge.\n\nIn salads or sandwiches they're a delight,\nAdded to burgers they set things right.\nCrispy and oily, a salivary dream,\nBeyond a doubt fries are an epicurean scene.",
