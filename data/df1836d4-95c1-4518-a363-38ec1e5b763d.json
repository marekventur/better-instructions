  "output": "Gender identity is a person's internal sense of their own gender, which may or may not align with their sex assigned at birth. It is a personal, unique and deeply-felt understanding of how someone identifies and who they feel they are inside. Some people identify with their assigned gender, while others may identify as another gender or genders, fluidly changing between gender identities, or gender neutral. Everyone has the right to express their gender however they choose, without judgement or prejudice.",
