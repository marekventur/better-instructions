  "input": "",
  "output": "Three differences between a neural network and a decision tree are:\n- Neural networks can learn and make educated guesses, while decision trees rely on predefined rules and don't have the capacity to learn.\n- Neural networks are most often used for complex tasks such as image or speech recognition, while decision trees are used for simpler tasks such as classification.\n- Neural networks can be trained with large amounts of data, while decision trees require less data for training.",
