  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural language processing (NLP) is used in healthcare to process and analyze large amounts of unstructured textual data, such as medical records and patient notes. NLP technologies can be used to extract important information from this data, such as patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and medications. Additionally, NLP can be used for tasks such as sentiment analysis of written patient reviews, automatic summarization of medical reports, and generation of diagnostic reports and treatment plans. NLP has enabled healthcare practitioners to better understand and respond to patient needs, and to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of medical practice.",
