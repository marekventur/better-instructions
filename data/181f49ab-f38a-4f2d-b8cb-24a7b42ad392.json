  "input": "",
  "output": "Currency devaluation is a deliberate downward adjustment to the value of a currency compared to another. By reducing the value of its currency, a country makes its exports cheaper in other countries and its imports more expensive, which can help boost its own economy. Devaluation can also reduce the purchasing power of a nation, thus causing inflation.",
