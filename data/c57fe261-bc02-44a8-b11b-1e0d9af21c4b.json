  "input": "",
  "output": "Consuming a plant-based diet has many health and environmental benefits. It can lower your risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Studies have also linked increased consumption of plants to improved mental health. Additionally, a plant-based diet can reduce your contribution to climate change and help conserve the planet\u2019s resources. Animal farming is incredibly polluting, as it produces large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorous and carbon dioxide. Furthermore, with a plant-based diet, you don\u2019t have to consume animal products with antibiotics and hormones, which negatively affects the environment and public health. Plant-based foods require a fraction of the resources that animal-based foods need\u2014they need much less land, water and energy to produce. Eating plant-based can also help reduce food insecurity, as more people could be nourished with fewer resources.",
