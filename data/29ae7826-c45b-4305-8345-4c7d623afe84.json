  "input": "",
  "output": "Computers use binary numbers and binary arithmetic to perform arithmetic calculations. Binary arithmetic is the process of manipulating binary numbers to perform calculations. Binary numbers are composed of a series of ones and zeros, which represent the various numbers in the base-2 numerical system. Binary operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, can be performed by manipulating the bits, or individual ones and zeros, in a binary number.",
