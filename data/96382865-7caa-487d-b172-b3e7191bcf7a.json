  "input": "",
  "output": "Electromagnetic radiation is essential for communication because it can be used to transmit information at high speeds over long distances. The radiation is a form of energy that can be used to send data, such as electrical signals, using waves across an electromagnetic spectrum. This makes it possible to send data through the air as radio waves, satellite signals, or even through fiber optic cables. By using electromagnetic radiation, data can be transmitted quickly and over long distances.",
