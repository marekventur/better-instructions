  "output": "The Hunger Games and Maze Runner are both popular books from the dystopian, young adult genre. Both tales follow the journey of protagonists as they fight to survive a post-apocalyptic world. While the Hunger Games is focused on a teenage girl fighting for her life in an arena-style, gladiator-style competition, Maze Runner is about a group of teens who must navigate through a deathly maze in order to escape the world they\u2019re imprisoned in. Both stories offer unique elements of suspense, adventure, and bravery, with The Hunger Games presenting a more cautionary perspective while Maze Runner takes a more investigative approach.",
