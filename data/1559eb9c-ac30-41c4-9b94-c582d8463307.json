  "instruction": "Explain the concept of a \"zero-sum game\" in layman's terms.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A zero-sum game is a situation in which the total gains and losses of the players sum to zero. This means that any gain by one player must cause an equal loss to another player. This type of situation is commonly found in economy and game theory and can also be found in day-to-day life. For example, a zero-sum game is when two buyers bid at an auction: the winner gains a product while the loser has spent their money with nothing to show in return.",
