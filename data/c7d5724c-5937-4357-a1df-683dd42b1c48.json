  "input": "",
  "output": "Water has several important properties, including its ability to form hydrogen bonds, a high surface tension, and three distinct states of matter - liquid, solid, and gas. It has a neutral pH, a high heat capacity, and is highly polar, which means it is very good at dissolving other substances. Additionally, it has an unusually high boiling point, due to its strong hydrogen bonds, and is essential for life.",
