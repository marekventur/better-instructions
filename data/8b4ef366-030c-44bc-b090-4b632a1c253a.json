One day, she found a bottle washed up on the beach. She opened the bottle and out popped a pirate captain. He was so grateful for his release, he offered to take her sailing. She accepted and soon they were off on a big adventure across the sea. They faced many dangers together, but eventually they made it safely back home. Amy was forever changed by her journey, and never forgot the magical experiences she shared with the pirate captain.",
