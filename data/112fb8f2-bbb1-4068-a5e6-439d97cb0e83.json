  "input": "She is lost in the middle of the forest with no one to help her.",
  "output": "Alice was lost in the forest, her phone long since dead from lack of signal. She wandered for what seemed like miles, until she came across an old woman tending a small fire in a clearing. The woman offered Alice a cup of tea, and Alice explained how she had become lost. The woman smiled and said she knew the way out, if Alice was willing to accept her help. Curious, Alice accepted and followed the woman. After an hour of walking, Alice emerged from the trees and saw her car waiting for her. As Alice thanked the woman, she discovered a small note in her pocket that read: \"If you ever feel like you are lost, sometimes all you need is a little help\".",
