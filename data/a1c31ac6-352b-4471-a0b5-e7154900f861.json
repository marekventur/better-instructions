  "output": "A key feature of a wind turbine is its ability to generate electricity from the kinetic energy of the wind. In modern turbines, this is accomplished through the use of three blades mounted on a vertical axis that rotate in the wind, thus turning a drive shaft connected to an electrical generator. The generated electricity is then fed into the power grid.",
