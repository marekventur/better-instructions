  "output": "One example of a business that can use blockchain technology to improve its operations is a media streaming service. With blockchain, users can make payments in cryptocurrency, which reduces the processing costs of the streaming company while keeping it secure. As well, payment information is securely stored on the distributed ledger which streamlines the payment process and reduces the risk of fraud. Furthermore, it can be used to securely store and transfer digital rights and ownership information, allowing the streaming company to protect its intellectual property.",
