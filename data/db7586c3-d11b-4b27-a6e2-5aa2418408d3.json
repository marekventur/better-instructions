  "output": "Qualitative and quantitative data are two distinct types of data that can be used to answer different types of questions. Qualitative data involves descriptive information that is often subjective and is used to answer questions such as \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow?\u201d. This data usually comes in the form of interviews, text, images and audio. Quantitative data, on the other hand, involves numerical information that is used to answer questions such as \u201chow much?\u201d or \u201chow many?\u201d. This data usually comes in the form of statistics, percentages or other measurements, and is often objective. While qualitative and quantitative data have their differences, they can be used in conjunction to gain a better understanding of a given situation.",
