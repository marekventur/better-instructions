  "output": "Open-ended questions are questions that do not have a single, specific answer. They are usually open-ended and allow respondents to answer in their own words and explore topics more deeply. Closed-ended questions, on the other hand, require a specific answer and provide respondents with a set of predetermined answers to choose from. Closed-ended questions do not allow respondents to elaborate more on the topic and answer in their own words.",
