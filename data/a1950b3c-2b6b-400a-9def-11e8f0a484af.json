  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a young princess living in a large kingdom. By day, she was a warrior fighting for justice, slaying dragons with her sword and shield. But in the dark of night, all she ever wanted to do was dance. She would sneak off to the forest and dance, letting her body move to the music of the stars and the moon. \n\nOne night, as she danced, she heard the distant sound of a violin playing. Entranced, she followed the music, dancing in time with the melody and search for the source of the sound. \n\nIn the distance, she saw a mysterious figure playing the instrument, its face hidden in the shadows as it continued to weave its melody. She stopped to listen, not wanting to disturb the stranger's performance. \n\nThe moment the mysterious figure finished, it put down the violin and stepped out from the shadows. It was a wizard, come to check on the princess and make sure she was alright. The wizard had seen her dancing in the forest, and played for her so that she could keep going even when the music had stopped.\n\nThe princess thanked the wizard for the gift of music and, from that day forward, she and the wizard were not just friends, but partners in adventures and stories to come.",
