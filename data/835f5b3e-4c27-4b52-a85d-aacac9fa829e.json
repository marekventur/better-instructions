  "input": "",
  "output": "Exponential growth is a process where a quantity increases at a rate proportional to its current size. This means the growth rate increases exponentially. For example, suppose the population of a species doubles every year. This type of growth can be represented by a curve on a graph where the line increases at a greater rate over time. Exponential growth can often lead to a rapid increase in quantity or size over a short period of time.",
