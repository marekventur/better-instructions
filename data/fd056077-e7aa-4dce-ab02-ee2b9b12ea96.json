  "output": "One way to make a bedroom look bigger is to use mirrors. Mirrors can create the illusion of more space in the room, as they can reflect light and make the walls seem further away. Additionally, using mirrors in different shapes such as round or octagonal also adds visual interest to a room. \n\nChoosing light-colored walls and minimal d\u00e9cor also makes a room appear larger. White or light pastel colors can make the room look less cramped, while minimal d\u00e9cor can avoid visual clutter which makes a room feel smaller. \n\nUsing large pieces of furniture with clean lines can also create a sense of spaciousness. Avoiding furniture with small details, such as intricate carvings and details, helps to keep the room spacious and open. \n\nFinally, utilizing smart organizational techniques can free up floor space, making the room look larger. Shelves, under-bed storage, and over-the-door organizers can help keep items off the floor, creating more space in the bedroom.",
