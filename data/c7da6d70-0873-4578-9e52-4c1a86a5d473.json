  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between networking and network security is their purpose. Networking is the process of connecting computers, systems, and other devices together to facilitate communication and the sharing of data and resources. Network security, on the other hand, is the practice of protecting these connected nodes, networks, and data from being accessed or damaged by malicious entities. Network security involves activities like encryption, firewalls, monitoring, user authentication, and intrusion detection systems.",
