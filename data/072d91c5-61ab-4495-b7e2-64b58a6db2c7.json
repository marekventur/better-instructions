  "input": "In some cases, the negative effects of tech may not be immediately visible, but tech has been linked to a variety of adverse health outcomes over time. Research has demonstrated that people who are over-absorbed in tech usage are more prone to developing mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. People who are highly engaged in social media, for example, are more likely to feel loneliness and satisfaction in life.\n\nAt present, it is unclear how much of an impact tech has on our mental health, and the literature is inconsistent. Some research suggests that tech can be helpful and beneficial when used in moderation, while other studies point to the potential psychological and neurological consequences of excessive tech use.",
