  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the given two pieces of data.",
  "input": "Piece 1: The temperature is 82 degrees Fahrenheit outside.\nPiece 2: The temperature is 28 degrees Celsius outside.",
  "output": "Both pieces of data present the same temperature, however expressed in different units of measurement. Piece 1states the temperature as 82 degrees Fahrenheit, a unit of temperature measurement used mostly in the United States, while Piece 2 states the same temperature as 28 degrees Celsius, a unit used throughout the world. Fahrenheit is a temperature scale where 0 degrees is absolute zero and water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. In Celsius, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees. The conversion rate between the two is that one degree Celsius is equal to 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.",
