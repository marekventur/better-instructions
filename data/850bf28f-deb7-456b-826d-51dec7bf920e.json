  "output": "For a beginner weightlifter, a good exercise routine would include 3-4 days of strength exercises such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, pull-ups, and bent over rows. These exercises should be done in the 8-12 repetition range, with 2-3 sets per exercise. On the other days, the weightlifter can complete aerobic and anaerobic exercises like HIIT (high intensity interval training) and running. This routine should be supplemented with adequate sleep and healthy nutrition to promote muscle growth and recovery.",
