  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between an internal and an external hard drive is that an internal hard drive is a component found inside your computer while an external hard drive is an independent device connected to your computer through a USB port or other connection type. An internal hard drive is generally larger than an external drive and offers faster transfer speeds, but external hard drives offer more flexibility and portability.",
