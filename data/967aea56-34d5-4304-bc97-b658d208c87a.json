  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the major challenges people are facing today due to climate change is an increase in extreme weather events such as floods, hurricanes, intense drought, and heat waves. These extreme events are becoming more frequent and more severe, impacting communities, economies, and ecosystems in unexpected ways. The effects of climate change are also felt in terms of water and air pollution, ocean acidification, and species extinction. These changes affect the health and wellbeing of individuals and the natural environment, with many of the impacts being felt by those most vulnerable in society.",
