  "instruction": "Given the following context, how would you help a user complete his task?",
  "input": "John has several tasks and he wants to finish all of them in the evening",
  "output": "I can help John by creating a list of the tasks he needs to do, and breaking them down into smaller steps or tasks. I can also suggest ways to help him stay motivated and focused on completing his goals. He can set a timeline so he can estimate the time it will take to accomplish each task. Additionally, he can prioritize his tasks and set aside at least 15 minutes of break in between tasks. Finally, I can also provide reminders of when to start and/or finish tasks.",
