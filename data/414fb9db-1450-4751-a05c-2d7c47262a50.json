  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived two birds in the woods. The first was content with what she had and lived happily, while the second became jealous of her neighbor and began to wish for the same things. To everyone's surprise, the second bird's wish eventually came true, but it still wasn't enough to make her happy. The moral of the story is that jealousy never brings anything good - it can only lead to unhappiness.",
