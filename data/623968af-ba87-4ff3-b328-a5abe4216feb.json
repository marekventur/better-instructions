  "input": "",
  "output": "Black holes have a significant impact on the evolution of galaxies. They swallow up nearby gas and dust, thus suppressing star formation in their surrounding regions. This can lead to the shutdown of star formation in a galaxy, thereby altering its evolution and appearance. In addition, black holes also help to regulate the growth of a galaxy by limiting the amount of material that is available to form stars.",
