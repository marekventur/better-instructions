  "input": "Food waste is becoming a huge issue.",
  "output": "Food waste has become a huge problem in many countries around the world. As populations increase and resources become scarce, there is a danger that food waste could become an even bigger issue, leading to resource scarcity and an increase in global hunger. A large amount of food production in different countries is wasted due to inadequate storage and harvesting techniques, improper transport, and improper waste management. All of these factors contribute to the growing food waste problem, leading to increased food insecurity, resource depletion, and environmental destruction. \n\nApart from this, food waste is also leading to unsustainable farming practices and considerable losses in the supply chain. This is particularly worrying, as it accelerates the destruction of vital ecosystems and habitats, leading to decreased biodiversity and greater climate change. As such, it is essential that we take action to reduce food waste and shift towards more sustainable farming and food production practices.",
