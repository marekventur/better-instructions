  "input": "",
  "output": "A Monte Carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique used to analyze decisions and model the probability of different outcomes. It grabs a large number of random samples from a given population and then uses the samples to make inferences about the population as a whole. It can be used to generate distributions of potential outcomes and to determine the risk associated with different courses of action.",
