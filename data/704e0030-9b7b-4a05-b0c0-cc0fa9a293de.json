  "output": "Making your own BBQ sauce is easy and only requires a few basic ingredients. Begin by combining ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, cider vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper in a medium-sized saucepan. Simmer the mixture on medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer for an additional 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings if desired. Once the sauce is cooled, store it in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 month.",
