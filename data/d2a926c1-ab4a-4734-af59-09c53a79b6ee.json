  "output": "Step 1: Choose a Site - Select a sunny location for planting the tulips and make sure there is sufficient drainage. \nStep 2: Prepare the Soil - Remove any large stones from the soil and work in some well-rotted compost. \nStep 3: Plant the Bulbs - Plant the bulbs 5-8 inches deep and spaced about 5 inches apart. \nStep 4: Water Well - Water the area thoroughly and make sure to keep the soil evenly moist until the foliage of the tulips appears. \nStep 5: Feed and Mulch - After the foliage appears it is a good idea to fertilize the flower beds with a balanced fertilizer and mulch the area with a two-inch layer of compost or straw to conserve moisture.",
