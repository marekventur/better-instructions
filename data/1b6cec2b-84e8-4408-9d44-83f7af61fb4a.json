  "output": "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to create the structure of a webpage. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used for styling and laying out a webpage. HTML is a markup language that provides the structure for a web page and consists of HTML elements and attributes. These elements and attributes define the content and any visual element that appear on a page. CSS is used to modify and enhance the visual appearance of the page. It contains a set of values assigned to elements, attributes and properties that control the presentation of the page. These include layout, color, font, and animation. CSS allows for more flexibility when styling a page. Therefore, HTML defines the structure and content of a website while CSS is used to design it and make it look attractive.",
