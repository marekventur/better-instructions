  "input": "",
  "output": "A storage array is a type of computer data storage system that contains multiple hard disks, all connected together to increase the amount and speed of data access. These disks can be organized and managed in a variety of ways, depending on the needs of the user. The structure of a storage array helps to protect against data loss and facilitate a more efficient way to store and retrieve data.  Additionally, it may offer features such as failover redundancy and automated data replication.",
