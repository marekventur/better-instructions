  "output": "This year, why not celebrate your friend's birthday with an at-home scavenger hunt?  You can set up the challenge by placing clues or presents around the house that they need to find. You can also make it even more enjoyable by teaming up with other friends and making it into a competition. After they've collected all the clues or presents, you can all enjoy a virtual dance party or have a movie night to mark the occasion. It will be a fun and memorable way to celebrate your friend's birthday this year.",
