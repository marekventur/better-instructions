  "input": "",
  "output": "Book clubs have existed since the 19th century as a means of sharing, discussing, and enjoying literature, educational texts, and other works of art. They are often made up of members of the same gender, although some book clubs are created specifically for mixed gender memberships. \nThe purpose of a book club is to serve as a social outlet for members to interact and discuss the topics or themes presented in the book. Additionally, many book clubs also provide educational opportunities, where members may explore topics more deeply or develop opinions on cultural aspects present in the book. Book clubs may also serve as a form of entertainment, through hosting events, games, or social gatherings related to the books selected.",
