  "output": "Moral hazard is a situation in which a person or institution has less incentive to guard against risk when protected from the consequences of their actions. In other words, when one is not exposed to the cost or consequences of actions taken, they may be less inclined to act with caution. This can lead to riskier behavior and subsequent losses for others.",
