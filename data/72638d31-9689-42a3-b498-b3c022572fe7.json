  "output": "Once upon a time, there were five frogs: Lily, Mary, Bob, Emma and Jack. They lived happily in a pond, but one day they decided it was time to venture out and explore the world. So, they said goodbye to their home and set off into the unknown. \n\nThe five frogs soon came across a beautiful garden. They made their way through the meadows and flowers, but Lily and Mary were so excited they forgot to pay attention. They ended up getting lost, and the rest of the frogs had to go and find them. \n\nWhen they finally found Lily and Mary, they realized they had all wandered right into a giant castle. The gates were closed shut and a dragon guarded it. The five frogs were so scared they couldn't move, but then they remembered something - they all knew how to swim! \n\nThey swam around the castle and found a secret passage. They snuck inside and started exploring, and soon enough they found a magical gem. Grabbing the gem, they made their way out of the castle and back to the pond. \n\nThe five frogs were very proud of themselves for their brave adventure. The next day, with the magical gem, they were able to make all of their dreams come true!",
