  "input": "",
  "output": "Hot data storage refers to data that is immediately accessible and is used for current processes. It typically uses faster technologies such as RAM, SSD, and NVMe for storage. Cold data storage is data that is not immediately accessible and is used for less frequently accessed data. Cold data storage typically uses slower technologies such as hard disk drives and tape backup systems. Hot data storage is faster but more expensive than cold data storage and is used when quick access is required. Cold data storage is slower but more economical and is used when access is not required on a frequent basis.",
