  "output": "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where labeled data is used to create a model that can make predictions about unlabeled data. In supervised learning, the training dataset consists of data that has already been labeled with the correct output, or the target value. The algorithm then learns from this labeled data and is able to make predictions on new, previously unseen data. Supervised learning is commonly used in image recognition, natural language processing and most machine learning tasks.",
