  "input": "Data: 10,000 images of animals",
  "output": "I would outline the steps to conduct analysis on the given data of 10,000 images of animals. The first step would be to clean the data and remove any irrelevant or incomplete images. The second step would be to explore the data, determining the number of classes and any common characteristics. The third step would be to preprocess the data, such as resizing and normalizing the images, to prepare them for modelling. The fourth step would be to model the data, either using supervised or unsupervised learning, depending on the desired outcome. The fifth step would be to evaluate the model and its results, measuring accuracy and fine-tuning parameters. Finally, the sixth step would be to interpret the results and make actionable decisions based on the outcome.",
