  "input": "",
  "output": "A machine learning algorithm for predicting the price of a house could be based on linear regression. The algorithm would use various features about the house such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, condition of the house, etc. to determine the price. The model would be trained based on input data and be able to make predictions about the price of a house that has not been seen before.",
