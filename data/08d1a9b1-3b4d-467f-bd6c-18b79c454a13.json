  "output": "The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is an amendment to the US Constitution that seeks to ensure equal rights on the basis of sex. The amendment was proposed in Congress in 1972, but did not receive enough votes for passage. If passed, the amendment would guarantee the rights of both men and women and prohibit any arbitrary discrimination based on sex. The ERA ultimately seeks to provide equality for women to ensure fairness in the workplace and in society.",
