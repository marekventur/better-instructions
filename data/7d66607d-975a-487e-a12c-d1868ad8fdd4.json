  "input": "The roads in the city are highly congested during rush hour.",
  "output": "An impractical solution to this problem would be to ban all cars from the roads during rush hour. This would be unfeasible as it would mean that people would be unable to get to work or school and make many everyday activities difficult or impossible. It would also cause mass disruption as it affects so many people's lives.",
