  "output": "The creative process is like running a marathon - it takes dedication, perseverance and hard work. It's also like being an artist and painting a masterpiece - each decision requires thought, creativity and skill. It's also like solving a complex puzzle, as you have to take disparate pieces of information and fit them together to create something new and meaningful.
