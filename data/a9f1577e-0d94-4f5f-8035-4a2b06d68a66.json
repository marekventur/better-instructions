  "output": "Let n = 25.\n\nStep 1: Declare an integer variable sum to store the sum of the first n even numbers. \n\nStep 2: Initialize sum to 0.\n\nStep 3: Run a loop from 2 to 2n with an increment of 2.\n\nStep 4: In each iteration of the loop, add \u2018i\u2019(the current index of the loop) to the sum. \n\nStep 5: After the loop, print the value of \u2018sum\u2019.\n\nStep 6: Exit the program. \n\nThus sum of the first 25 even numbers is 650.",
