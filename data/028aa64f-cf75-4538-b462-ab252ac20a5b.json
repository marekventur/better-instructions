  "output": "I recently read the book The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by V.E. Schwab, which explores complex themes of family relationships. It follows the life of Addie, a woman from the 18th century who makes a Faustian bargain to gain her own immortality - but in exchange, no one will remember her. It follows her as she travels throughout time and deals with the effects her bargain has had on her relationships with family.",
