  "input": "",
  "output": "There are some steps that you can take to address this concern. Firstly, it\u2019s important to set a good example yourself by cutting down on the usage of technology, particularly in front of your child. Some other ideas include setting tech-free times and places in the house, such as during meal times or in the bedroom; setting up rules on device usage, such as a ban on screens during the week; and helping your child find alternative activities, such as outdoor play, reading, or taking up a hobby. Ultimately, it is important to be consistent and patient, while helping your child to make better choices.",
