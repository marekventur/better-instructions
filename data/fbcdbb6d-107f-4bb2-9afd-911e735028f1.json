  "input": "Essay Text:\n\nAn essay is a piece of writing that conveys the writer's opinion on a subject. It consists of a combination of facts and thoughts on the topic at hand.",
  "output": "The machine learning program should be designed to detect copied text by comparing the essay with existing written material. The program should analyze the essay for patterns such as sentence structure and length, common phrasing, and repetition of words or phrases. The program should also take into account the context of the essay, as some copying can be subtle and difficult to detect.",
