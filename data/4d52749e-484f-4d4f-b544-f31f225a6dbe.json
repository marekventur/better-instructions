  "input": "Quantum Entanglement",
  "output": "Quantum Entanglement is a phenomenon that occurs when two particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle affects the state of the other, no matter how far away they are from each other. This connection between two particles is called entanglement, and the particles are said to be entangled with each other.",
