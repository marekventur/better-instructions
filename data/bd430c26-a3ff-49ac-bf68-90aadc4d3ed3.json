  "instruction": "Explain why the death penalty should be abolished.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The death penalty should be abolished because it does not act as a deterrent for crime, it is irreversible, and it can lead to the execution of innocent people. Furthermore, the death penalty perpetuates the cycle of violence by not providing rehabilitation or the opportunity for redemption. It also disproportionately affects members of minority groups and the economically disadvantaged.",
