  "output": "To tune a 6-string acoustic guitar, start by selecting a reference note, such as the low E string. Using a tuning fork, play the reference note and pluck the corresponding string on your guitar. Adjust the string's tuning peg until the note sounds the same. Then repeat this process for each of the strings from low to high - E, A, D, G, B, E. Make sure to check the notes often when you're tuning as the strings can quickly slip out of tune. Finally, once all of the strings are in tune, give it a once-over, playing each string to ensure it is still in tune.",
