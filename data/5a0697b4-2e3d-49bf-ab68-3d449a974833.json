  "input": "",
  "output": "Starting to save money begins with creating a budget and tracking spending. People should make sure the money they are saving is going into an account that has a good return rate, and they should start small. It can also help to automate transfers to savings accounts, automate bill payments, find cheaper alternatives for spending unnecessarily, and set up a savings account with a designated purpose, such as retirement or a certain goal.",
