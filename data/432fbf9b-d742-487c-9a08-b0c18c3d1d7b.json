  "input": "No input",
  "output": "The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on people in India has been severe and far-reaching. Many businesses have shuttered, leaving millions of people without work, at the same time essential supplies such as food are facing increased demand and decreased supply, leading to price hikes. From an economic perspective, unemployment has risen significantly, many people who had no access to banking prior to the pandemic have been unable to access the benefits of the government's relief funds, and several large projects have come to a halt resulting in short-term losses. In the long-term, there could be a decreased demand in the market, a decrease in the investments from the government, and an increase in poverty.",
