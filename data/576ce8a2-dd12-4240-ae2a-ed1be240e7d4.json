  "input": "",
  "output": "The quote implies that success in life does not depend on the luck of having favorable circumstances or lucky opportunities, but rather on the ability to make the most of what is at hand. One must be able to think creatively, take calculated risks and make difficult decisions in order to turn any situation into a success. The message is that having the right cards is not enough, one must also know how to play them in order to win.",
