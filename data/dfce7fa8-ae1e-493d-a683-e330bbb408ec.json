It creates and manages an investment portfolio tailored to individual investors' needs, using data from the investor to assess their risk tolerance, goals, and time horizon. The robo advisor uses algorithms to allocate investments in a portfolio that can help pursue the investor's financial goals. In order to use a robo advisor, the investor has to fill a questionnaire to assess their risk profile, financial goals and time horizon. After that, the robo advisor will provide recommendations on the best investment portfolio for the investor.",
