  "input": "",
  "output": "Two ways to ensure data security are using strong passwords and implementing multi-factor authentication. Strong passwords should include a combination of letters, numbers, and characters and should not use words that can be easily guessed. Multi-factor authentication requires users to enter a username along with a one-time code sent via text message or email. This extra layer of security can help protect against unauthorized access to personal accounts.",
