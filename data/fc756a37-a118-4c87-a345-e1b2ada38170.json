  "input": "",
  "output": "Biofuels are a promising renewable energy source because they are clean burning and can be efficiently produced from a variety of plant materials. They could potentially provide an alternative to burning fossil fuels, reducing our reliance on dwindling supplies of oil and helping us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, biofuels are also cost-effective and offer the potential for greater energy independence.",
