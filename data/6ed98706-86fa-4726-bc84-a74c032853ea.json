  "output": "My concept for a new mobile application is a language learning game. The game would focus on teaching users a foreign language through fun and interactive activities. Features would include level progressions, rewards, and translation tools to test users understanding of the language. The app would be designed to be self-contained so that users do not need an internet connection to use it.",
