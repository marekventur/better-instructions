  "output": "The day was foggy in the imaginary village of Forestclaw, and the only thing louder than the loud, persistent crickets was the explosion. Old Skipbuck, a forgetful gadget inventor, had once again created a contraption that he hadn't fully tested. His invention had produced the explosive loud noise, and soon villagers gathered around Skipbuck's house to investigate. He had been so sure he had it right this time - but was proven wrong.",
