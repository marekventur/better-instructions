  "output": "Evolution is the process by which living things change over time. It is how species become adapted to their environments and how new species are formed. Evolution is a process that happens over thousands of years and is driven by natural selection. It means that the animals and plants that are best adapted to their environment will survive and pass on their genes to the next generation.",
