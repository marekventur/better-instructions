  "instruction": "How does a heart pump blood to the body?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The heart pumps blood throughout the body, beginning with the right atrium and ventricle and ending with the left atrium and ventricle. The blood travels from the right side of the heart, through the lungs to receive oxygen, and then to the left side of the heart. From there, it is pumped out to the rest of the body through a network of blood vessels. These vessels become increasingly narrower until they reach the arteries, capillaries, and finally the veins. The oxygen-rich blood is then circulated to cells throughout the body and the cycle is repeated.",
