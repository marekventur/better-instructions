  "instruction": "Come up with an experiment to test the impact of a new product.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The experiment would involve two groups: the control group and the experimental group. The control group would be exposed to the product in its current state and given instructions on its use. The experimental group would also be given instructions on the product's use, but would be exposed to the new product version. The results of the experiment would be measured through surveys and focus groups. The aim of the experiment is to assess the level of user satisfaction and acceptance of the new product versus its current state. The survey or focus group discussion could also address any technical or product-related issues that arise when using the new version.",
