  "input": "COVID-19 pandemic",
  "output": "The economic cost of the COVID-19 pandemic has been immense. Global GDP is estimated to decrease by $3.9 trillion this year as a result of coronavirus-induced measures. Additionally, the total number of unemployed persons worldwide is expected to surpass 195 million in 2020; this is 20 million more than in 2019. In many countries, businesses are barely surviving, and in some cases, gone. In the worst-hit areas, supply chains have been completely disrupted, causing massive losses to the global economy. Furthermore, inequality levels have risen due to the pandemic, and poverty is predicted to escalate significantly.",
