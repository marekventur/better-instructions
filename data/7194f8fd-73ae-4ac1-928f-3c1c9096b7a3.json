  "output": "A principle of economics that supports free trade is the law of comparative advantage. This states that even if one country can produce a good or service more efficiently than another country, the two countries can still benefit from trading with each other. This is because each country has the ability to produce something more efficiently than the other, and so both countries can benefit from trading with each other.",
