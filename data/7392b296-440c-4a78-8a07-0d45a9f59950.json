  "output": "Social media affects our daily lives in a multitude of ways. It allows us to stay connected with friends and family, give us access to news and information, and offer a platform to share our ideas and thoughts. It also provides us with entertainment and can increase our sense of belonging by connecting us to like-minded people and groups. However, it can also lead to feelings of isolation and comparison, and can make us more likely to be exposed to cyberbullying, trolling, and other forms of harm.",
