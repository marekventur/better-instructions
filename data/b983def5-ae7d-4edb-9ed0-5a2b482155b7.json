  "instruction": "Explain the differences between synaptic plasticity, habituation and adaptation.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Synaptic plasticity is the process in which neural pathways can change with experience; neurons can either strengthen or weaken their connections with one another based on the amount of neuron activity. Habituation is the decrease in response to a repeated stimulus, while adaptation is the adjusting of the response of the organism to the environment. Synaptic plasticity changes the actual structure of the neuron, while habituation and adaptation merely alter how the neuron responds or behaves.",
