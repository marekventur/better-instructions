  "instruction": "Implement a program that randomly generates a password.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "This program will generate a random, secure password by randomly selecting characters from a predefined character set. The program will start by defining the character set which will contain upper and lowercase Alphabetic characters, numeric digits and special characters. The length of the password entered by the user will be used to determine the number of characters left in the character set. Then the program will use a random number generator to randomly select characters from the character set based on the length that was entered. Once the character selection is complete, the program will output the randomly generated password to the user.",
