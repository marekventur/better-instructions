  "output": "I would recommend the movie Searching. It's a captivating mystery with a unique structure, told entirely through computer screens. The story follows a father in his search for his missing daughter, and the events that follow unfurl at an engaging pace. The movie is a testament to how technology can be used to deceptive ends, and how easy it is to use technology to learn more than we might want to know.",
