  "output": "Ultraviolet radiation has many important roles in our environment. It helps to break down pollutants in the atmosphere, preventing them from reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. It also aids in the production of Vitamin D in humans, and helps to protect plants from ultraviolet damage. Finally, it is believed that the ozone layer helps to block out harmful UV radiation, protecting the Earth\u2019s surface and its inhabitants.",
