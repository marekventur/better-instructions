  "output": "Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that every point mass attracts every single other point mass by a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. It states that the gravitational force between two bodies decreases as the square of the distance between them increases.",
