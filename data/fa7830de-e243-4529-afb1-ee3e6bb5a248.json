  "output": "Recently, a study involving artificial intelligence was conducted in which AI was used to detect early signs of Alzheimer's Disease. The AI-driven algorithms were able to accurately predict the disease based on scans and brain inputs from participants. This marked a major milestone in the field of healthcare, as it could drastically reduce the cost of early diagnosis of the disease and save countless lives. Studies like these showcase the potential of AI to create a more efficient healthcare system, one where patients would receive the treatment they need in time.",
