  "output": "Improving writing skills involves evaluating one\u2019s current skill level, setting goals, and practicing regularly. \n\nTo begin, assess the current skill level. This can be done via self-assessment, or by taking a writing assessment with a language expert. This will provide a baseline from which to improve. \n\nSet specific goals. These can be related to grammar, sentence structure, punctuation, style, etc. Link the goal to an activity, such as reading books or articles in the area which the goal is related to, or practicing timed-writing exercises.\n\nLastly, practice regularly. Writing should become a routine, just like any other activity. Start by writing for short periods, then gradually increase the time. Rewrite the same material, rereading and editing it - this will sharpen the skills. Focus first on topics or works related to the goals, then write on topics which are of interest.\n\nWorking on these steps week by week will eventually lead to an improvement in writing skills.",
