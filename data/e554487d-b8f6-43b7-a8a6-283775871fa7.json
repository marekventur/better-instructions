  "input": "Apriori Algorithm",
  "output": "The Apriori algorithm is a popular algorithm used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules in a given dataset. It works by scanning the data set and searching for subsets or combinations of items that appear together frequently. The algorithm then uses the discovered frequent itemset to generate a set of association rules which can be used to make inferences about the data.",
