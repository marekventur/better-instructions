  "input": "",
  "output": "The recruitment process during the COVID pandemic should be conducted with extra caution. First, HR departments should consider holding virtual interviews instead of face-to-face. They should also screen potential candidates by asking questions to ensure that no one has been exposed to the virus. They should also ensure that candidates dress professionally for the virtual interviews. Furthermore, in order to reach out to potential candidates, HR departments should use online job postings and advertise for remote job roles.",
