  "input": "The Reproductive Justice Movement",
  "output": "The Reproductive Justice Movement is a interrelated social movement that seeks to ensure everyone has the rights, resources and freedom to control their bodies, genders, sexualities, and reproductive lives. The movement is intersectional, aiming to bridge the gap between reproductive rights, health, and justice by addressing how racism, sexism, poverty, and other socio-economic factors affect reproductive and sexual rights. It recognizes that women of color, LGBTQIA+ people, immigrants and non-English speakers, people with disabilities, and low-income individuals face greater historic and likely future oppression than those privileged in the same area.",
