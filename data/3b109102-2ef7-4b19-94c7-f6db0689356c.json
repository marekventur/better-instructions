  "output": "The beach at sunrise is a breathtaking sight. The horizon glows with the golden hues of the morning sun, soft waves rolling onto the shore and reflecting the sun\u2019s rays in dazzling brilliance. The sky is often streaked with dazzling shades of pink and orange, while the horizon shimmers with a deep blue hue. The sand glitters with thousands of broken shells, each one catching the light of the morning sun. Seagulls and other shore birds can be heard chirping, adding to the peaceful atmosphere.",
