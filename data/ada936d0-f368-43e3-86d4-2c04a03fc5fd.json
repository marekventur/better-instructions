  "instruction": "Design an AI-based system to detect suspicious activity in an office building",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The AI-based system should be able to detect any suspicious activity in an office building. It should use sensors to detect suspicious sounds, movements, and abnormal temperature variations. Additionally, the system should use facial recognition and license plate readers to identify any suspicious individuals or vehicles. It should also be able to monitor incoming and outgoing data, analyze for suspicious activity, and alert security personnel if necessary. Finally, it should provide features such as track-and-trace, improved access control and enhanced monitoring through historical data analysis.",
