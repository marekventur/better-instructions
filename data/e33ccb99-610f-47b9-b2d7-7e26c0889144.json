  "output": "A winding river moves through the town,\nGently but strong and graceful, always in town,\nIt sparkles and glistens like a diamond in a crown,\nFlowing freely, swiftly, joyfully and sound.\n\nIt brings freshness and life with each ebb and flow,\nTo green fields, gardens, and much that is below,\nThe people feel its presence wherever they go,\nMaking lovely music, a burble and a low. \n\nThe river meanders along the winding way,\nEnriching each place it passes through day by day,\nBringing kindness and life to everyone it meets -\nIt brings hope, and joy with its playful, gentle beats.",
