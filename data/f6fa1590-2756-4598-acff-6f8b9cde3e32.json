  "instruction": "How does debt consolidation work?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Debt consolidation is a way to combine multiple debts into one debt with one payment each month. It usually involves taking out a loan from a bank or other lender in order to pay off multiple smaller debts. The debt consolidation loan will usually have a lower interest rate than the original debts, allowing for a lower overall payments. The money from the loan is used to pay off the smaller debts, and then the borrower will owe only the loan and the associated interest. Usually, the loan is federally-guaranteed and can stretch out payments over a longer period of time.",
