  "input": "",
  "output": "XYZ School requires all students to be up-to-date on all recommended immunizations for their age and be aware of the latest health information. All students must provide proof of up-to-date immunizations on or before the first day of school. Parents/guardians of new students who do not have proof of up-to-date immunizations must provide proof that their child has begun the vaccine series before they are allowed to attend school. For each immunization, school personnel will inform the parent/guardian of compulsory immunization requirements. The school will maintain a record of all immunizations, and parents/guardians must keep their child\u2019s record up-to-date. \n\nExemptions for medical or religious reasons are available. However, to be eligible for an exemption, the parent/guardian must submit a signed statement from a medical professional to school personnel stating that the student cannot receive certain vaccines due to a medical condition, or submit an affidavit stating that the immunization is contrary to their religious belief. \n\nXYZ School will also comply with N.C. law regarding emergency vaccinations. Emergency vaccinations will be administered at the discretion of the school.",
