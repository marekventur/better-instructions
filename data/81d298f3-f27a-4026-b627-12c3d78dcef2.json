  "output": "Climate change can have serious effects on the environment. It leads to a rise in average temperatures and an increase in extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes. Rising temperatures can also cause glaciers to melt, leading to a rise in the sea level. Warmer temperatures can also disrupt ecosystems, leading to species extinction and shifts in biodiversity.",
