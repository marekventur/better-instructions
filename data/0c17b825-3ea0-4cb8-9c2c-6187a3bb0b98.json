  "input": "",
  "output": "The US COVID-19 testing strategy has been criticized for its slow rollout, gaps in access, and inability to provide timely results to people who need them. Testing capacity was not adequately increased in the early stages of the pandemic, resulting in massive shortages of supplies and testing kits. This was compounded by the limited access to testing for certain demographic groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and low-income individuals. Additionally, the tests available could not provide timely results, resulting in a further backlog in data, which slowed the process of contact tracing and hindered the ability to control the spread of the virus.",
