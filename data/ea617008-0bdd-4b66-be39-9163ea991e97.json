  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a magical bird named Dari. Dari was a beautiful peacock, but with a secret. Whenever Dari opened its wings, a different world appeared around it. Dari could travel to anywhere it wanted and see anything or anyone.\n\nDari used its powers to explore the world and help others. It flew over the oceans and saw creatures no human had ever seen before. It flew over the deserts sand met nomadic people living in tents. It even flew to space and saw the stars close up! \n\nWherever Dari flew, people looked up in awe and joy. They thanked the magical bird for bringing them hope and happiness.\n\nThe end.",
