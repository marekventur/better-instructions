  "instruction": "Design a mobile app for disorganised people.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A mobile app for disorganised people could include features such as calendar and task management, automatic reminders, and voice prompts for quick reminders. It should also prioritize tasks and allow for easier categorisation of tasks which could be sorted and filtered by priority, date, or even keyword. Integrating artificial intelligence capabilities could allow users to set up schedules, goals and patterns as well as detecting patterns over time. Additionally, having a minimal yet intuitive user interface with a \u2018jump in anywhere\u2019 approach is essential since disorganised people are easily frustrated. A task list and calendar should be freely accessible and quickly accessible from the home page of the app. Finally, the app should also provide detailed and visual tracking/monitoring of task completion rates.",
