  "input": "Piezoelectricity is an electricity-generating phenomenon observed in certain crystals, such as quartz, tourmaline, and topaz. Piezoelectricity is created when a pressure is applied on the crystal and causes opposite charges to move to the crystal's two opposite sides. The pressure can be mechanical, thermal, or acoustic; the generated voltage can be voltage, electric current, or charge.",
