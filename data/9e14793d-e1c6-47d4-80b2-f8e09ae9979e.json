  "output": "A \"Pay-What-You-Want\" pricing model might be used by a small cafe where customers can pay whatever they want for their coffee. The cafe may keep a suggested price of $3, but customers are encouraged to pay any price they can afford. This helps the cafe keep their doors open while still accommodating those with less disposable income.",
