  "instruction": "Provide a persuasive argument for why animal testing should be banned.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Animal testing should be banned because it is cruel and inhumane, unnecessarily costly, and unreliable. It is cruel because it causes fear and distress to animals, and in many cases can lead to death. It is expensive because the same results can often be obtained through more humane and reliable methods such as computer modelling or cell cultures. Additionally, animal testing is not as reliable as other testing methods due to the physiological differences between species, making any results difficult to generalize to humans. It is clear therefore that testing on animals should be stopped in favour of better methods that use fewer resources while providing more reliable results.",
