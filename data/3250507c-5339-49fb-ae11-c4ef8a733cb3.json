  "output": "Once upon a time there was a boy who had a sudden recollection of a forgotten memory. He remembered going to the beach with his family many years ago. He remembered the smell of salty air and the roar of the waves. It was so vivid he could almost taste the sea breeze. He smiled and hugged his family as they made sand castles, watched the sunset, and enjoyed the moment. But then the moment passed, and he was left with a forgotten memory that he would never forget again.",
