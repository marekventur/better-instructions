  "instruction": "How does heat affect the rate of a chemical reaction?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Heat increases the kinetic energy of a reaction and helps to break down existing bonds, forming new products. As a result, heat increases the rate of a chemical reaction by allowing more molecules to come into contact with each other, thus increasing the frequency of collisions and the number of successful reaction pairs.",
