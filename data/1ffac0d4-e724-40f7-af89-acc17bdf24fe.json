  "output": "A student studying for an exam should create a schedule that includes: \n1. Making a study plan. Break down the material that needs to be covered, and set specific daily goals to review the material. \n2. Set up a quiet, comfortable study space. Make sure there are no distractions such as TV or music. \n3. Set aside blocks of time for studying. Set a timer for each block, and focus strictly on studying during that time. \n4. Take breaks. Spending too much time studying can lead to burnout, so take regular breaks to rest your mind and body. \n5. Make use of study tools such as flashcards, practice tests, and online resources. \n6. Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep affects concentration and focus, so make sure to get an appropriate amount of rest on a consistent basis.",
