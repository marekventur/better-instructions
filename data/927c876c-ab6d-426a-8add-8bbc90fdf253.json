  "output": "The debate about the potential benefits and drawbacks of artificial intelligence is ongoing. On one hand, AI offers many potential advantages, such as accelerating research and development, aiding in disease detection, and providing enhanced customer service. AI is also expected to save jobs by automating mundane tasks and eliminating human error.\n\nOn the other hand, AI raises potential ethical concerns, as well as vulnerabilities in data security. AI has already been leveraged for nefarious purposes, such as deep fakes, and there is a possibility that malicious actors could abuse AI to manipulate public opinion and discredit public voices. In addition, the displacement of human labor by automation is a concern, as it could create economic instability.",
