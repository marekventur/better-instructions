  "output": "The Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War were two of the largest and deadliest conflicts of the 20th century. The Cuban Missile Crisis involved a standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union over Soviet nuclear missile bases in Cuba, while the Vietnam War was a prolonged military conflict in Indochina between the North, which was backed by the Soviet Union and the South, which was backed by the United States. The Cuban Missile Crisis unfolded over a period of 13 days in October 1962, with the resolution coming in the form of a diplomatic agreement. The Vietnam War lasted for 19 years, beginning in 1954 and ending in 1973, with the signing of the Paris Peace Accords. While both of these conflicts were Cold War related, they were also very different in terms of causes, objectives, strategic objectives and outcomes. The Cuban Missile Crisis did not result in any direct military conflict and was resolved primarily through diplomacy and the decision to withdraw nuclear weapons from Cuba. On the other hand, the Vietnam War was a prolonged series of battles resulting in significant losses for both sides. The Vietnam War also had a significant impact on the United States, as it highlighted the realities of a prolonged conflict and the limits of U.S. military intervention. Additionally, the Vietnam War also drastically changed the way public opinion viewed the military and the use of force.",
