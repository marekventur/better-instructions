  "output": "The protagonist of \"Catch-22\" is Yossarian, an American airman serving in Italy during World War II. Yossarian is an individualistic, iconoclastic figure who attempts to survive by thwarting the arbitrary and chaotic regulations of the military. Yossarian styles himself as an \"everyman\" who is driven by a dual struggle: escaping death in combat, and outwitting the military bureaucracy that perpetually states that \"catching 22\" would be easier.",
