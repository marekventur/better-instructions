  "input": "",
  "output": "The main differences between laptops and desktop computers are their form factor, size, portability, and power consumption. Laptops are much more portable than desktop computers, as they are small and lightweight and can be taken almost anywhere. Desktop computers are less portable, but they tend to be more powerful than laptops due to their larger size and the ability to upgrade certain components. Additionally, laptops typically have a lower power consumption and a smaller screen size compared to desktops. Finally, desktop computers tend to provide better-quality video, audio, and gaming performance than laptops.",
