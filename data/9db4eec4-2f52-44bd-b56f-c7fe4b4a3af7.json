  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a virus and a worm is that a virus requires user interaction to spread, while a worm can spread itself from one computer to another on its own. Viruses can modify files and damage data, whereas worms are generally designed to replicate themselves and spread to other computers. Viruses can also spread to other computers through infected media and files, whereas worms usually exploit security vulnerabilities to spread.",
