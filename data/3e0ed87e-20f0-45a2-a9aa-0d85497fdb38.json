  "output": "The Pythagorean Theorem is an equation used to calculate the sides and angles of a right triangle. The theorem states that the square of the lengths of the sides of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of its two shorter sides. In other words, a2 + b2 = c2, where a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides and c is the length of the hypotenuse.",
