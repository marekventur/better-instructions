  "input": "",
  "output": "The process of turning code into something useful is known as compilation. It is a multi-stage process that begins by transforming the source code written in a programming language into an intermediate language known as bytecode. This bytecode is then processed by a virtual machine which translates the bytecode into an executable machine-readable format. Finally, the compiled executable is then run on a computer, where it is able to execute instructions and produce the desired output.",
