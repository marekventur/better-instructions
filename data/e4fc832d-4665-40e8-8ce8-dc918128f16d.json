  "instruction": "Identify and explain two benefits of living in a society.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Living in a society has many benefits. One is that it allows us to access resources that are out of reach to us as individuals. As a society, we are able to pool resources and work together to obtain items that no one of us would be able to attain alone. This creates a greater quality of life for everyone in the society. \n\nAnother benefit of living in a society is the sense of community and belonging it provides. By living in a society, we are part of an interconnected web of relationships, where we can have a positive influence and support each other. We have people to turn to, and this can be invaluable when we face difficult challenges in life.",
