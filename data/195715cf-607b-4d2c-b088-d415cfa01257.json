  "input": "",
  "output": "The twelve-bar blues pattern in the key of A is: A-A-A-A-D-D-A-A-E-D-A-E. It begins with four bars of the I chord (A), followed by two bars of the IV (D), back to two bars of the I chord, one bar of the V (E), another two bars of the IV, and finally two bars of the V. This repeating pattern can be used when writing and playing a musical composition in the blues style.",
