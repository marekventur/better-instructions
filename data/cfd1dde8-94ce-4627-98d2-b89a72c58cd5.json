  "input": "",
  "output": "Encryption is an important part of online security because it enables users to protect their data from unauthorized access. When data is encrypted, it becomes unreadable and unusable to anyone who doesn't have the encryption key. This way, even if someone were to gain access to the data, they would not be able to make use of it. Encryption is the best way to ensure that data remains secure and protected from malicious individuals and cyber attacks.",
