  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm to find the next palindrome number given a starting point is as follows:\n\nStep 1: Take the number as the starting point.\nStep 2: Reverse the number, call it nrev.\nStep 3: If nrev is greater than the starting point, then nrev is the next palindrome.\nStep 4: If nrev is less than the starting point, add 1 to the starting point, then calculate nrev for the new number. If nrev is greater than the new number, then nrev is the next palindrome.\nStep 5: If nrev is still lesser than the new number repeat steps 4 and 5 until the next palindrome is found.",
