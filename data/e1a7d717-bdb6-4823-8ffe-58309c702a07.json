  "output": "Global warming is having a significant and damaging impact on the most vulnerable parts of the world in multiple ways. Rising sea levels, increased temperatures, and changes in weather patterns are leading to more droughts and floods, reduced food production, the spread of diseases, and the increased prevalence of extreme weather events. These effects are particularly severe in regions with already limited resources and poverty-stricken populations, leading to widespread displacement and livelihoods lost.",
