  "input": "",
  "output": "A specific example of a conflict of interests is when a company employs its owner's family members. This can lead to a conflict of interests because the family members may not be hired on the basis of their qualifications or job experience, but instead because of their connection to the owner. This can create an unequal situation where their performance may not be held to the same standards as other employees.",
