  "instruction": "Explain the concept of tail recursion using a programming language",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Tail recursion is an optimization technique used in recursive functions that allows a function to call itself without having to store the previous state of the program. This is done by replacing the recursive call with a loop, thus eliminating the need to store the previous state on the stack. As an example, the following code in Python demonstrates a tail recursive function that finds the sum of the first n numbers:\n\ndef tail_recursive(n, result):\n    if n == 0:\n        return result\n    else:\n        return tail_recursive(n - 1, n + result)\n\nsum = tail_recursive(5, 0)",
