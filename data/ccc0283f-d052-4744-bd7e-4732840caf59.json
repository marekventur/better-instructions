It remains to be seen what the long-term implications of the crisis will be, but economists have warned that some sectors may take years to recover.",
  "output": "The coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on the global economy. With lockdowns in place, many businesses have been forced to shut their doors and an unprecedented number of people now find themselves out of work. \n\nAlthough the full extent of the economic damage caused by the pandemic will only become clear over time, economists have warned that some sectors may take years to recover. For this reason, it\u2019s important to consider the short-term and long-term effects of the crisis and make plans now to mitigate the damage.\n\nIt is clear that the coronavirus pandemic has already had a significant impact on the economy, and it is likely that this impact will be felt for years to come. It\u2019s up to all of us to work together to ensure that the economic damage caused by the pandemic is minimized as much as possible.",
