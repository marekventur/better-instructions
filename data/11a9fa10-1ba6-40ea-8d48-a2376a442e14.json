  "input": "",
  "output": "The underprivileged have the advantage of having an open perspective, which can give them an edge when it comes to seeing things from different angles and looking at opportunities that can benefit them. They often have a better understanding of what life is like in different walks of life, and a better appreciation for others. This understanding can often lead to a more adaptive and creative outlook, making it easier to find solutions and achieve success.",
