  "output": "Monica was a woman of legendary beauty, she had been born with an enchanting and delicate face that could mesmerize anyone she came across. Everywhere she went, she was surrounded by admirers and suitors, yet Monica was determined to find true love, not just admiration. \n\nOne day, she heard of a wizard living in a nearby village and was certain that he could make her dreams come true. She packed her things and set off to visit the wizard, driven by her desire for true love. After a long journey, she arrived at the wizard's house and knocked on the door, but there was no answer. \n\nGrowing increasingly impatient, Monica searched around the house and eventually, she found a secret door. Excited to find the wizard, Monica opened the door and was surprised to find that the wizard was in fact...her own reflection! She had been searching for true love the whole time without realizing that her own beauty was enough to make her dreams come true.",
