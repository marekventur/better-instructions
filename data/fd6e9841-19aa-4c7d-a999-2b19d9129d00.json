  "input": "",
  "output": "To build a paper airplane, first fold an 8.5x11 inch piece of paper in half lengthwise. Then unfold and fold down the top corners towards the centerfold. Once the paper is shaped into a triangle, fold the sides inwards to meet the center fold. Flip the paper over and fold down the top layer of the triangle to make a flap. At the top of the folded flap, make two inverted pleats and secure the ends in the center. Flip the paper over and fold the sides in to fit the length of the paper and create wings. Lift the wings up slightly to create the flying shape of the airplane and throw it to watch it soar.",
