  "output": "An artificial neural network is composed of several layers of nodes or neurons that are connected in a specific configuration. The nodes in each layer are connected to all the nodes in the previous layer, and each connection has an associated weight. Data is fed into the network and propagated through the layers, with the weights of the connections adjusted based on the data. The output of the network is the result of the calculations performed by the neurons in the final layer.",
