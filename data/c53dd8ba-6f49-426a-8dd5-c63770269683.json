  "output": "A strategy for developing artificial intelligence should include several components. First, it is important to have a clear goal and understanding of the desired outcome. Then, it is important to collect and label data. Additionally, it is important to develop algorithms that can process this data and understand how to make decisions and predictions. It is also important to evaluate and refine the algorithms, as well as to evaluate the overall performance of the system. Finally, it is important to deploy the system and monitor it for performance.",
