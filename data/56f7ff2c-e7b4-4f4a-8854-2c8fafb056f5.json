  "input": "",
  "output": "A computer reads data from the internet by establishing a connection to the web server, then sending a request for a particular file or page, and then downloading the data from the server. This is usually done by a web browser but other programs, such as databases, can also contact web servers for data. The data is then stored in a computer's memory in a structured format so that programs can access and process it.",
