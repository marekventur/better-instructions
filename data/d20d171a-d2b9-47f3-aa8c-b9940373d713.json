  "input": "Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to \u201clearn\u201d (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as \u201ctraining data\u201d, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.",
