  "input": "",
  "output": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to gain experience and improve performance. Machine learning algorithms use statistical techniques to find patterns in data that traditional programming does not detect. Traditional programming is a coding process that requires direct instructions to process data and produce results. It does not learn from experience and relies on rules-based programming to process data.",
