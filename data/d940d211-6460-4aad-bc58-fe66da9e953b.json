  "output": "Once upon a time in a far away land, there lived a beautiful princess named Aurora. Aurora was the only daughter of the King and Queen of the kingdom, and everyone she met wanted to be her friend.\n\nOne day, the Princess received a mysterious package. Inside was a small wooden music box, delicately carved with intricate patterns. When Aurora opened it, she heard the most beautiful melody fill the air. She was so enchanted by the sound that she closed it immediately and held it close to her heart.\n\nA magical voice then whispered to her, \"Dear Princess, this music box has been specially crafted to grant your greatest wishes. Open it when the time is right and you shall see what wonders await you\".\n\nAurora was excited to find out what kind of power the music box held, but was afraid of what might happen if she opened it too soon. She decided to keep it safe in her room and bring it out only when she really needed it.\n\nOne night, when Aurora was feeling especially lonely, she opened the music box and immediately heard the same beautiful melody fill the air. She also saw a bright light form in the center of the room, and out came an enchanting figure that identified itself as her guardian angel.\n\nThe angel told her that the music box was her ticket to fulfilling her dreams, and so she was granted three wishes. Her first wish was to have true and loyal friends who would always be by her side, the second wish was to find her one true love, and the last wish was to become the most powerful and respected ruler the kingdom had ever seen.\n\nThe angel granted each wish, and after returning back to the heavens, it was said that Princess Aurora had changed the kingdom forever. She was loved by all her subjects, and her reign was remembered as a true golden era in the kingdom's history.\n\nThe magical music box was passed down from generation to generation, and its secrets were kept safe from prying eyes. Over the centuries, Aurora's wishes had come true, and her kingdom flourished and grew under her guidance. The magical music box was a reminder that anything was possible if you just believed.",
