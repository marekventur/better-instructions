  "instruction": "Explain how an object can spin in the air",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An object spinning in the air is caused by its momentum. When an object is thrown, the spinning motion can be created by a combination of forces, including gravity, thrust from the throws, aerodynamic drag and lift, and friction. As the object begins to move through the air, various forces act on it, resulting in the spinning motion.",
