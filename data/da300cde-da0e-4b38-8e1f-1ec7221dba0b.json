  "instruction": "Compare carbon dioxide emissions from electric and petrol-powered cars",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Electric cars produce significantly less carbon dioxide emissions compared to petrol-powered cars. Emissions from electric vehicles are much lower overall since they don\u2019t release greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. For example, a petrol-powered car emits around 100-200g of CO2 per kilometer, whereas an electric car produces zero emissions. Electric cars are thus more environmentally friendly than their petrol-powered counterparts.",
