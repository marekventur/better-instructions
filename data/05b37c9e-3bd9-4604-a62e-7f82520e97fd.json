  "output": "A classic example of an imagemap is an interactive map of a city. Each part of the image is linked to a different page of information. For example, the image may contain different regions of the city, each of which is linked to a page containing detailed information about that area. When the user clicks on a certain region of the map, they are directed to the corresponding page. This makes it easy to navigate the city's attractions, streets, and other locations.",
