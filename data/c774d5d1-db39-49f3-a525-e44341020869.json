  "output": "Supply and demand is a fundamental concept in economics that refers to the interaction between buyers and sellers in a market. It is based on the principle of the price influencing the quantity of goods demanded and supplied. The demand for a product is influenced by its price and availability, and how much utility it provides to consumers. The supply of a product, meanwhile, is determined by the price of the product, the availability of resources to produce it and the costs of production. Supply and demand work together, with increases in the demand leading to increases in the supply and vice versa. This helps to determine the equilibrium price of the product in the market.",
