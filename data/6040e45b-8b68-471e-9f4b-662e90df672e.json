  "output": "One way to solve the problem of inequality in education is to ensure access to quality education for all children, regardless of their socio-economic background. This can be done by offering more public funding for schools in disadvantaged communities and providing children from these areas with scholarships and other support. Additionally, governments should implement policy changes, such as reducing class sizes and providing additional teacher training to ensure that all students receive the best possible education. Finally, programs should be implemented to engage parents in their child\u2019s educational success, in order to ensure that every child has access to quality educational opportunities.",
