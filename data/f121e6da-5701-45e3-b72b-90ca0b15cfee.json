  "input": "What are some ethical considerations when using AI?",
  "output": "When using AI, some of the ethical considerations involve making sure that the data used to train the AI algorithms is accurate and unbiased, so as to prevent any kind of discrimination. Additionally, when AI is used in decision making, the human oversight should not be completely removed, and it is important to ensure that there is a process in place for correcting any wrong decisions. Furthermore, any AI algorithms should be designed to be transparent and explainable, so that their decisions can be understood and validated.",
