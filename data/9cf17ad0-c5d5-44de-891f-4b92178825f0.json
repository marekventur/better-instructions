  "input": "",
  "output": "DNA and RNA are both nucleic acids, but they differ in many ways. DNA is a double-stranded molecule while RNA is a single-stranded molecule. DNA is most commonly found in the nucleus of a cell, while RNA is usually found in the cytoplasm. DNA is a stable molecule and can store genetic information for long periods of time, while RNA is a transient molecule and its information is usually used in a limited amount of time. DNA is used to create proteins, while RNA is used to carry instructions from DNA to ribosomes to create proteins.",
