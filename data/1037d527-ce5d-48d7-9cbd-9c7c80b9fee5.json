AI-driven algorithms can also identify patterns and correlations in the data, and can suggest the best course of action based on desired outcomes. Furthermore, AI can help in automating certain routine tasks, freeing up human resources to focus on more important and complex tasks. Thus it is clear why AI can contribute to better decision-making.",
