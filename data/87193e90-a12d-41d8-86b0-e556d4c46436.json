  "input": "",
  "output": "Helena from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream is a passionate yet naive young woman, deeply in love with Demetrius. In her desperation to win him over, she is willing to do whatever it takes - even if it means chasing him through the woods and competing with Hermia for his affections. She is also brave, standing up to Oberon and Titania when they enchant Demetrius and nearly gets her wish before the course is righted. Despite being overlooked by those around her and enduring numerous failed attempts to win Demetrius, she perseveres and remains true to what she desires most, displaying a kind of resilience and determination that is admirable.",
