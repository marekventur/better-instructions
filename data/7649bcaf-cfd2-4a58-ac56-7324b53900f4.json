  "output": "The industrial revolution was a period of major changes in manufacturing, agriculture, mining, transportation, and technology that began in the late 1700s in Britain and spread to Europe and North America. During this period, new manufacturing techniques, improved efficiency of steam power, and the invention of new machines, such as the power loom, made it possible to produce goods on a much larger scale than before. This transformation led to an increase in both population and economic growth, creating a new capitalist economy based on the production and sale of goods.",
