  "instruction": "Describe how oceanic currents are formed",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Oceanic currents are formed when winds, tides, temperature differences, and salinity gradients combine to create a flow of water. Winds cause surface currents, while tides create a movement of water in a vertical plane. Temperature differences create thermohaline circulation and shape oceanic currents, while salinity gradients influence the density of water, which in turn affects the movement of water.",
