  "output": "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format to another for storage or transmission. Data is encoded using an algorithm, which is designed to represent the data in a specific way. This encoding allows the data to be transmitted efficiently, while still allowing the data to be interpreted by the recipient. \nData decoding is the process of reverse engineering the encoded data back into its original form. This can be done by using the same algorithm used to encode the data, or by using another algorithm that is designed to decode specific data types. This decoded data can then be used for any desired purpose.",
