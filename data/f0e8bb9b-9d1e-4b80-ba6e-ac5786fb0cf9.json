  "instruction": "Create a scientific experiment that would test gravity on humans",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An experiment to test gravity on humans could involve having a group of participants stand on a level surface and then recording the force that the earth applies on them by measuring the pressure on their feet. Participants could be asked to stand in different postures, such as leaning forward or backward, and angles, such as to the left or right. The results would be measured with a force plate and the data analyzed to see how the force of gravity affects the human body.",
