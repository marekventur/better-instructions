  "input": "Boiling an egg",
  "output": "An experiment to determine the length of time it takes to boil an egg could involve boiling a certain number of eggs in an open pot of water. Then, time how long it takes for each egg to reach the desired level of coagulation. The result of each egg can be compared to the control and averaged to determine the average boiling time for the experiment.",
