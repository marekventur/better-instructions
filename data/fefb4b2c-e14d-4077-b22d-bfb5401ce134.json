  "output": "The night is alive with stars, \nShimmering and twinkling above.\nThe night sky is a blanket of light,  \nEndless and ineffable love. \n\nThe stars are a reminder of beauty and hope,\nA silent witness to time that ebbs and flows. \nOur gaze is transfixed, we cannot help but to cope,\nWith the wonders of a star-filled night that glows. \n\nEven when darkness cloaks the sky, \nThe stars keep burning so bright.\nTheir cool, shining light mesmerize and inspire, \nLeading us onward and away from ordinary plight.",
