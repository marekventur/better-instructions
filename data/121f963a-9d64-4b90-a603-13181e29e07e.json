  "output": "Machine Learning is like a student studying for an exam. The student is provided with a collection of data and resources to learn the subject, then they must deduce the best way to answer the questions based on the material they have encountered. With this knowledge, they can then attempt to answer the exam questions correctly. Similarly, when a machine is provided with data, it must draw upon its observations to identify the best output to provide a desired result.",
