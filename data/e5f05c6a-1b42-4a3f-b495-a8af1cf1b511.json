  "input": "",
  "output": "The cassowary is a large and powerful bird native to Indonesia, New Guinea, and northeastern Australia. Its strong legs and feet are well adapted for navigating the dense rainforest undergrowth. Its distinctive three-toed feet are equipped with sharp claws that allow it to jump over obstacles, climb steep slopes, and forage for food. Its unique physiology also helps to regulate its body temperature during the hot and humid conditions in the tropical regions where it lives. In addition, its brightly colored feathers are used to warn other birds and predators of its presence. Cassowaries use their sharp claws to defend themselves from potential predators, and their heavy bodies provide stability when they are running. Furthermore, the cassowary's food-digesting system is adapted to process the large variety of fruits and soft vegetation that makes up a large part of its diet.",
