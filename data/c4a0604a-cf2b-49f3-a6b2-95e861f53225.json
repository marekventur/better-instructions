  "input": "",
  "output": "A neuron is a basic unit of the nervous system that sends electrical signals throughout the body. It is composed of a cell body, dendrites, and an axon. A synapse, on the other hand, is a junction between two neurons that enables them to communicate electrochemically. It consists of an axon terminal, a synaptic cleft, and a dendrite. Neurons transmit electrical signals while synapses transmit chemical signals, allowing neurons to communicate over longer distances.",
