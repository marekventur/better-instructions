  "output": "Amid protests for police reform across the United States, attention has shifted to the little-known aspects of police power such as police contracts. These contracts are created by union negotiations between police management and local governments, and dictate the terms of work, pay, and discipline. Police unions argue that such contracts ensure justice for officers and prevent favoritism or discrimination. Critics claim that the contracts block accountability and reform efforts, as well as protect officers accused of misconduct. Despite calls to revisit these contracts, the process is slow and laborious. Police reform activists hope that large-scale mobilization may put the pressure needed to reform these contracts and make a change in police practices.",
