  "input": "",
  "output": "In the small town of Maplewood, there is an old, gnarled tree that stands in a dense forest. The locals know it as the Haunted Tree, and it is said to be the home of a menacing spirit. On certain nights, a loud scream can be heard coming from the great oak- a warning for those who would dare venture too close. Over the years, it was said that anyone who had the misfortune of brushing up against the tree was cursed with bad luck and doom. Any who seek to defy the warning of the Haunted Tree are likely to find themselves in a heap of trouble.",
