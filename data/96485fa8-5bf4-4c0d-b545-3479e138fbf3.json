  "input": "",
  "output": "The Principle of Complementarity of Structure and Function is a fundamental principle of biology which states that the structure of an organism or its parts is determined by its function. This means that the character of an organism is determined by its ability to detect, process and respond to environmental cues. This principle is used to explain how certain changes in the structure of an organism allow it to better carry out vital functions, such as predator avoidance or reproductive success.",
