  "output": "Verse 1:\nSitting here in the park, sights and smells of nature\u2019s art,\nGazing up at the sky, finding peace in a tranquil try, \nBirds are chirping a song, dragonflies a comforting throng, \nChildren playing with joy, take a breathe and enjoy the new toy.\n\nVerse 2:\nGentle winds brushing over my face, finding solace and comfort in this place, \nThe sun is warm and inviting, reminding me to keep fighting, \nPeaceful pond over by the bench, all these sights I won\u2019t forget.\n\nChorus:\nAh, such a peaceful day in the park, \nEverything is so peaceful and stark, \nMy worries drift away with the wind,\nYes, such a peaceful day in the park. \n\nVerse 3:\nRolling hills in the background, the sky is so welcoming, \nGrass so green, trees so tall, everything here feeling so small, \nButterflies are playing their game, as the sun starts its descent in the frame, \nTaking in this moment of joy, all I need is some warmth from the sun above.\n\nChorus:\nAh, such a peaceful day in the park, \nEverything is so peaceful and stark, \nMy worries drift away with the wind,\nYes, such a peaceful day in the park. \n\nVerse 4:\nClouds rolling by, so quiet and slow, \nLoved ones close, feeling ready to go, \nWinding river down the right, ducks and geese taking flight, \nThe park is so calming and serene, I wish I could stay here 'til unseen.\n\nChorus:\nAh, such a peaceful day in the park, \nEverything is so peaceful and stark, \nMy worries drift away with the wind,\nYes, such a peaceful day in the park.",
