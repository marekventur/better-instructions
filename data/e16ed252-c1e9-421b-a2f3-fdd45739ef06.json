  "input": "",
  "output": "The social implications of having a surveillance society include the potential for increased surveillance of citizens, which can lead to a decrease in personal privacy and a feeling of being watched at all times. Additionally, surveillance can lead to a culture of fear and mistrust, as citizens may feel like they are being monitored and judged by authorities. Finally, surveillance can be used to target different groups or individuals, which can lead to inequality and injustice.",
