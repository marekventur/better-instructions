  "instruction": "Explain why decision trees may be better than linear models for certain problems.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Decision trees are better than linear models for certain problems because they are able to capture non-linear relationships between predictors and outcomes. They are also able to account for interactions between predictors, and can easily interpret and visualize the results. Decision trees are great for finding the most important predictors in a dataset, as they can quickly identify which factors significantly influence a model's outcome. Finally, they are more flexible than linear models and can be adapted to different situations by tweaking the parameters.",
