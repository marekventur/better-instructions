  "output": "Circadian rhythm is the internal 24-hour clock of the body that regulates many physiological processes, such as sleep\u2013wake cycles. Circadian rhythm is controlled by the hypothalamus in the brain, and is based on the daily changes in light and darkness levels as well as several hormones that are released at different points throughout the day. The body's physiological processes are synchronized to the external environment in order to regulate its own work-power balance and maximize the effectiveness of its many daily activities. Places with an inconsistent day-night cycle, such as on a plane or in an area with a constantly changing environment (e.g. in the Arctic), can affect one\u2019s circadian rhythm and cause disruption of the natural balance.",
