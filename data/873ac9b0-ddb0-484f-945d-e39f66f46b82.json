  "output": "To use a pressure cooker, first make sure that the lid is on securely and the vent is open. Put the filled pressure cooker on the stove over medium-high heat and bring it up to pressure. Once the desired pressure is reached, turn the heat down to low and time the cooking process. Once the timer is done, turn off the heat and allow the cooker to cool down until the pressure is completely released. Then, open the lid carefully and enjoy the cooked food.",
