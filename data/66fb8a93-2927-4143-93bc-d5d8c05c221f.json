  "input": "",
  "output": "Two ethical issues that arise in technology are privacy and data security, and the use of algorithms to make decisions. With the prevalence of technology, privacy and data security are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Companies are collecting and using large amounts of personal data and algorithms are often used to determine outcomes. Both of these can lead to ethical dilemmas such as the potential for data to be used to discriminate or the misuse of algorithms to manipulate people or outcomes.",
