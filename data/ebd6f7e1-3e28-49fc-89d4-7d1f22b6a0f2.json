  "instruction": "Design a room with a beach theme.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The design of the room is influenced by beach elements. The walls are painted with a light blue color, creating an atmosphere of tranquility and relaxation. Large windows or glass paneling allow for plenty of natural light to enter the room, giving it an airy feel. The bed is a replica of a boat, with white-painted wood and blue accents to emphasize the beachy theme. The bedding is white and light blue, accented with shells and other beach-themed trinkets for a cozy feel. The dresser and nightstands are asymmetrical and painted a light shade of yellow, contrasted with bright white trim to create a beachy aesthetic. Along the wall is a built-in wardrobe, painted white, with a pop of red. The room is completed with a rug in a web pattern of various shades of copper, tan, and dark blue, echoing the natural elements of the beach.",
