  "output": "A spring day is usually filled with a warm breeze, the scent of freshly bloomed flowers and the sound of songbirds echoing through the air. The sun is bright and the sky is a clear, beautiful blue. Everything looks alive and in motion - the trees are green and new leaves are sprouting, the grass is lush, and the blooms in the gardens are vibrant. The air is filled with the cheerful chirps of the birds and the occasional buzzing of the bees.",
