  "input": "",
  "output": "Idea 1: Allow natural light into the classroom. \nDetails: Install larger windows for better lighting and ventilation. Place some small plants in the classroom for a more pleasant environment. Have adjustable shades that can be closed when necessary or to reduce glare during presentations. \nIdea 2: Create an open work space. \nDetails: Move the tables and chairs around to create an open space. Take away any physical barriers between the students and the teacher. Have comfortable chairs that ensure students can sit properly throughout the class. Provide bean bags or cushions to make the seating more comfortable.",
