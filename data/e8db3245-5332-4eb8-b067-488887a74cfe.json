  "output": "Once there was a person who always ignored safety regulations when they were working. Every time they were told to wear safety glasses, use protective clothing, or use other safety measures, they just shrugged them off, thinking they would be fine without them. One day, while they were working, they were struck by a spark and were injured. From then on, they realized how important it is to follow safety regulations.",
