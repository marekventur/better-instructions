  "input": "",
  "output": "Setting boundaries in relationships is important to ensure both parties feel safe, respected and valued. Boundaries can help to maintain the balance of power in the relationship, as they clearly define what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. They promote open and honest communication, which can help both parties understand their roles and expectations in the relationship. Finally, boundaries can help both parties engage in healthier behaviors, as the boundaries set will help to prevent conflicts and toxic behavior.",
