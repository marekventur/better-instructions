  "output": "1. Practice mindfulness: mindfulness is a great tool for relieving anxiety. Take time to focus on the present moment - breathing, sounds, sensations and thoughts - and let the anxious thoughts drift away. \n\n2. Exercise: physical exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters that can help to improve your mood and reduce anxiety. \n\n3. Connect: talking to family, friends and professionals can help to alleviate feelings of anxiety, particularly when you're feeling overwhelmed. Make sure to reach out if you need additional support.",
