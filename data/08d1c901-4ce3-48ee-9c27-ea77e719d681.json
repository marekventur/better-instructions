  "input": "",
  "output": "Data-driven decisions are often better than decisions based on instinct alone for two primary reasons. First, data-driven decisions are based on actual evidence and are likely to be more accurate than decisions based on a biased opinion. Second, data-driven decisions are more easily communicated, accepted, and understood because they are backed up by facts and research. They also help to limit subjectivity and personal prejudice, as data can objectively evaluate the merits and drawbacks of any decision.",
