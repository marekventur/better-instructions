  "output": "President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s Administration had a large role in bridging the gap between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He set up the \u201cOpen Skies\u201d policy which allowed both nations to fly aircraft over other countries and allowed the exchange of information that could have potentially been used in espionage. He also sought to limit the arms race by proposing the \u201cAtoms for Peace\u201d program, which was designed to provide a peaceful alternative to the Cold War. In addition, Eisenhower developed the policy of \u201cPeaceful Coexistence\u201d which was designed to improve economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries. All of these initiatives helped to reduce tensions between the two nations, leading to a reduction in military conflicts and improved diplomatic relations.",
