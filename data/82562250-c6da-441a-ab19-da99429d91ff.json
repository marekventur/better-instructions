  "input": "",
  "output": "Wind turbines work by harnessing the energy of the wind. Wind turbines have long blades which turn in the wind, causing a shaft to turn and spin a generator. The generator then converts this kinetic energy into electrical energy which is then fed into the electrical grid.",
