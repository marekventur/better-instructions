  "output": "One way to stop even minor forms of cyberbullying is to talk to your children about respecting others online. Emphasize the importance of being kind and respectful, and remind them that they should never post hurtful comments or messages or use technology to harass others. Teach them to use the \"block\" or \"ignore\" functions of their social media and to report cyberbullying if they observe it.",
