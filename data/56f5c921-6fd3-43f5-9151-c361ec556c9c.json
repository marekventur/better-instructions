  "output": "One game suitable for a group of 8 people is Trust Me. The goal of the game is for each player to accurately guess the other players\u2019 answers to a predetermined question.\n\nEach player will write down their answer to a question, such as \u201cWho is your favorite actor?\u201d, on a piece of paper and fold it. Once everyone has done this, the papers are placed in the middle of the table and players take turns drawing one answer each. The player then has to guess who wrote the answer and the other players have to guess if the player is right. Players can win points by accurately guessing answers and trusting other players\u2019 guesses. The winner is the player who accumulates the most points.",
