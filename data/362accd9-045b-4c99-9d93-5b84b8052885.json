  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce energy consumption in households is to install energy-efficient appliances such as ENERGY STAR appliances. Additionally, households can switch to Energy Star certified light bulbs, use programmable thermostats to regulate temperature settings, and unplug or turn off appliances when not in use. Other changes that can help reduce energy consumption include using natural light during daytime hours, installing solar panels, and taking advantage of utility company programs such as off-peak pricing.",
