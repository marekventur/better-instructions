  "input": "",
  "output": "PH levels play an important role in plant growth. Plant roots act as a pH regulator, releasing and absorbing hydrogen ions to balance the soil's pH. If the pH level is too low or high, it can interfere with the plant's ability to absorb essential nutrients, effecting its growth and health.",
