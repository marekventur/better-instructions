  "output": "The wise old sage had a long white beard and wore a deep blue hooded robe that was covered in patches. His eyes were the color of the sea and carried the weight of centuries of experience. He was a master of philosophy and storytelling, often sharing ancient tales that held deep life lessons. He carried a wisdom that could only be earned through long hard years of study, and his knowledge was sought out by the youth of the kingdom.",
