  "input": "",
  "output": "Anaerobic exercise consists of short bursts of high intensity activity, while aerobic exercise consists of continuous, low intensity movement. Aerobic exercise increases heart, lung, and circulatory health and is great for weight loss, while anaerobic exercise builds strength, power, and speed, and builds lean muscle mass. These two types of exercise work together to improve overall health and performance, and can be combined for even greater benefits.",
