  "output": "The algorithm takes an array of N integers, A[1], A[2]\u2026, A[N] and performs a bubble sort to create a new sorted array B[1], B[2]\u2026, B[N]. Starting from index 2, it compares each element A[j] with its immediate predecessor A[j-1]. If A[j] is smaller than A[j-1], the two elements are swapped and j is decremented by one. This process is repeated until A[j] is no longer smaller than A[j-1] or j = 1.",
