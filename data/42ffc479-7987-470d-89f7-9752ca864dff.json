  "output": "The five data analysis methods are descriptive analysis, inference analysis, predictive analysis, prescriptive analysis, and optimization analysis. Descriptive analysis is used to describe the relationships between data sets and summarizing the data. Inference analysis is used to identify cause and effect relationships between variables. Predictive analysis is used to determine the likelihood of certain outcomes. Prescriptive analysis is used to identify the right solution to a certain problem. Lastly, optimization analysis is used to optimize processes and outcomes.",
