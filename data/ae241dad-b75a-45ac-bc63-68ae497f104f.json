  "output": "A fun way to do a science experiment is to grow a crystal garden. Gather together some Epsom salts, a shallow tray, and some food coloring. Place a small amount of water in the tray and sprinkle it with Epsom salts. Once the water has been absorbed, add a few drops of food coloring to give your crystals some color. Let your crystal garden sit overnight and the next day you will have created a colorful and fun crystal garden.",
