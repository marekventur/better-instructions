  "input": "",
  "output": "A domino effect is a chain reaction where small causes lead to larger and larger consequences. For example, a small pebble being dropped into a calm lake can cause a series of ripples that get increasingly larger as they reach the shore. Similarly, one small event can lead to a long chain of other events, all leading to a large outcome that none of the smaller events could have foreseen on their own.",
