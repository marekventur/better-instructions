  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a man named John who found himself stranded on a desert island. He had no clue how he got there, or how he would survive. But John was resilient, and he was determined to make the best of his situation. He learned how to survive on the island, and managed to build himself a little hut out of the materials he found around. He also made some weapons, such as a bow and arrows, and spears to defend himself. One day, John made a remarkable discovery - a chest hidden away under a thick layer of sand. Inside the chest, he found a map that showed the way to civilization. With newfound hope, he built a raft and journeyed across the sea. Finally, John made it back home, recounting his incredible story along the way. He never forgot the lessons he learned on the island, which he carried with him for the rest of his life.",
