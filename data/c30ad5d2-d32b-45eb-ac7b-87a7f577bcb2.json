  "output": "In 2012, scientists discovered the Higgs boson particle, sometimes referred to as the \u201cGod particle\u201d. This particle is believed to be the key factor in giving other particles mass, which is important to explain why some particles have mass while others do not. The discovery confirmed the Standard Model of particle physics, a theory developed by scientists to explain the fundamental nature of matter.",
