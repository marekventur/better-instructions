  "output": "The use of technology in the criminal justice system has led to both positive and negatives outcomes. First, the use of technology has allowed for the collection and collation of evidence in a faster, more efficient manner than ever before. This has improved the accuracy and reliability of court decisions, which has in turn improved the accuracy of justice being served. Technology has also made it easier to track offenders, which has improved the efficiency and accuracy of the criminal justice system.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some potential negatives associated with technology in the criminal justice system. First, there is the potential for abuse of technology, as those with access to certain types of technology may be able to manipulate forensic evidence or track offenders without consent. There is also the potential for human error or bias, as machines are not infallible and may make mistakes in certain situations. Finally, technology is expensive, and may be prohibitively so for many jurisdictions, making it difficult for them to access new technologies and benefit from the improvements they provide.",
