  "input": "",
  "output": "I predict that advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) will lead to significant disruption to the job market, resulting in a shift towards more automated and digital roles. Some jobs will become obsolete as AI takes on more tasks and responsibilities, while some roles may remain but become more specialized. Jobs requiring human interaction and emotional intelligence will be more resilient to disruption.",
