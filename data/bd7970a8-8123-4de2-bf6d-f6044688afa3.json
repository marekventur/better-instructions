  "output": "A great way to teach an 8-year-old geography is by creating a globe scavenger hunt. Start by having the child locate and identify the continents on the globe and list the countries in each continent. Then create a list of questions about each continent, such as the capital city of each country and important geographical features. The child can answer the questions by looking at the globe and finding the answers.",
