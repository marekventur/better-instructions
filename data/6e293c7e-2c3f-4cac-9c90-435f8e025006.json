  "output": "Robots can be used to assist with disaster relief in a variety of ways. Robots can be deployed to search for survivors in dangerous or inaccessible areas. They can also be used to transport supplies to remote areas or evacuate injured people. Robots can help detect hazardous substances in the environment and conduct reconnaissance and survey missions to determine the extent of the damage. Finally, robots can also be used to assist with removal of debris and infrastructure restoration.",
