  "input": "",
  "output": "Algorithmic complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm requires to complete a task, while algorithmic efficiency is a measure of the amount of work needed to complete a task. Algorithmic complexity is measured by the number of operations required to finish a task, and algorithmic efficiency is measured by the time it takes for a task to be completed. For example, an algorithm that runs in linear time (O(n)) is more efficient than an algorithm that runs in quadratic time (O(n^2)) because it will take less time to finish a given computation.",
