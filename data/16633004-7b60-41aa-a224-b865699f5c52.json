  "input": "",
  "output": "The Battle of Waterloo, fought in 1815, marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the restoration of power to the monarchies of Europe. It also saw the start of the Concert of Europe, which was a system of states that tried to maintain peace and preserve the balance of power on the continent. Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo ushered in an era of increased cooperation between the European powers and greatly weakened French influence in Europe. The establishment of the Concert of Europe also led to the suppression of revolutionary and nationalistic movements, and helped to keep Europe at peace for nearly a century.",
