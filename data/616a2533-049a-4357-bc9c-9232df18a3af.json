  "output": "Yes, here is a simple recipe for a two-person chocolate cake. You will need 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup butter or margarine, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon baking powder, and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0. Grease an 8-inch round cake pan with butter or non-stick cooking spray. In a medium bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder, sugar and baking powder and mix together. Add the butter, eggs and vanilla and mix until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool before turning it out onto a plate and serving.",
