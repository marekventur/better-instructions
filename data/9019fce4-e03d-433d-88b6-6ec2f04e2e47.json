  "output": "Cross-validation and out-of-sample testing are two methods of validating machine learning models. Cross-validation is a technique that divides the data into a training and a testing set, where the model is trained on the training set and tested on the testing set. Out-of-sample testing is a validation technique used to evaluate the accuracy of a model with unseen data. Both techniques are used to evaluate the accuracy of a model, as well as to mitigate the risk of overfitting. However, cross-validation is more suitable for small data sets, while out-of-sample testing is better suited for larger, more complex data sets.",
