  "input": "",
  "output": "One limitation of GPT models is that they require a lot of data to generate realistic and accurate responses. GPT models also struggle with understanding complex causal relationships and context-dependent reasoning tasks. Additionally, GPT models are prone to producing repetitive, biased, and factually inaccurate content that can be difficult to detect.",
