  "instruction": "Explain why the moon looks different on different nights.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The moon looks different on different nights due to the fact that the moon is constantly changing its position in the sky relative to the Earth. As it orbits the Earth, the moon's position changes every night. This means that the angle at which sunlight reflects off the moon changes and that the moon is illuminated differently, resulting in different looks on different nights. Additionally, the moon travels through different phases every month and during a full moon, it is fully illuminated, appearing bigger and brighter than usual.",
