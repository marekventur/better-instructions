  "output": "Once upon a time, there was an old apple tree that grew in a meadow. Every day, a small robot called Botron would come by to take one apple from the tree and enjoy its sweet taste. Botron was so attached to the tree that it often spoke to it, thanking it for its delicious apples. One day, the tree noticed that the robot's movements were getting slower and slower. It quickly realized that its apples were the cause, and so it decided to start giving Botron fewer apples each day. In this way, the robot could keep coming back for more, and the apple tree could stay healthy. And from that day on, Botron and the apple tree lived peacefully and happily in the meadow.",
