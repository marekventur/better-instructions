  "input": "",
  "output": "Once upon a time there were two siblings, Julie and John. John was always the overachiever and Julie, the younger sibling, often felt inadequate and jealous of her brother. When Julie got an invitation to a party and her brother did not, she felt as though she'd finally one up on him. However, John was determined to attend the party and resorted to sneaking out of the house at night. He arrived at the party only to find that Julie had been the one that had received the invitation, and the two siblings got into a heated argument. In the end they came to the realisation that they were stronger together than apart and decided to support each other in the future.",
