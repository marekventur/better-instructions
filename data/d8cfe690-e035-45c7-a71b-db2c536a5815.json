  "input": "",
  "output": "Both microwave ovens and convection ovens are used to heat and cook food. The main difference is that microwaves heat food quickly and use radiation, while convection ovens use circulated hot air to heat food. Microwave ovens are also better for defrosting and reheating food, while convection ovens are better for baking, roasting, and crisping foods.",
