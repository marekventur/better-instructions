  "input": "",
  "output": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses abstractions to create models based on the real world. It employs four main principles: object orientation, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. Object orientation is the concept of organizing code around objects rather than functions and how they interact with each other. Polymorphism is the ability of classes to be extended and modified on-the-fly using inheritance and subclasses. Abstraction allows for the removal of unnecessary details from complex systems, allowing for a better focus on key processes. Encapsulation is the process of combining related data and functions into a single unit which can be manipulated as a single entity.",
