  "input": "",
  "output": "Going to the grocery store helped Little Red Riding Hood because it allowed her to buy a basket of food to take to her grandmother. This enabled her to complete the errand that her mother had given her and also prepared her for when she encountered the Big Bad Wolf on her way. She was able to scare off the Big Bad Wolf with the items she had bought at the store and make it to her grandmother's house safely.",
