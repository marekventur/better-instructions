  "output": "Snip Snap Snorp is a card game that is played with a standard 52-card deck. In this game, the objective is to have the lowest card value at the end. The game starts with each players receiving 3 cards and by the end of the game each player should have the same number of cards. The player who starts is chosen randomly and the turn moves in a clockwise manner. \n\nThe basic rules for this game are as follows: \n1. Each player on their turn must put down one card, either singly or in pairs, threes or fours. \n2. When the card is placed on the table, the next player must either \u201csnip\u201d (pick up the card), \u201csnap\u201d (pick up the card and discard another card from their hand) or \u201csnorp\u201d (declare that they cannot pick up the card). \n3. If a player can pick up the card, then they may add one of their cards to the set, or create a new set. \n4. When all players have passed their turn, the player with the lowest card wins the round. \n5. The first player to get rid of all of their cards wins the game.",
