  "input": "",
  "output": "Rich soil is composed of a mixture of minerals, nutrients, organic matter, and microorganisms. The minerals contribute to soil structure and provide essential elements like calcium, magnesium, and potassium that are important for plant growth. Nutrients, contained in organic matter, provide essential plant nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Microorganisms work to break down organic matter, releasing and cycling essential nutrients in the soil. This rich soil is essential for optimal plant growth.",
