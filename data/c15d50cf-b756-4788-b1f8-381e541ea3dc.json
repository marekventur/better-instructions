  "output": "Jimmy had an egg that he wanted to make into an omelet. He looked inside his fridge and saw a block of cheese and an onion. He had a brilliant idea to create the perfect cheese omelet by combining the three ingredients. He diced the onion and grated the cheese, combined them together with the egg, and started to cook. The result was a delicious and flavourful omelet that he was proud to share with his friends.",
