  "output": "Whales are one of the most amazing creatures on our planet! They are the largest living mammals and have adapted to nearly every ocean on Earth. I find one of the most fascinating facts about whales is that they produce different types of sounds to communicate with one another. Recent studies have shown that some whale populations produce distinct dialects of music and sound, which help them to distinguish each other. I'm also particularly intrigued by the possibility of whales with longer lifespans, as the average age of living whales ranges from 40 to 80 years old, compared to humans which max out around 100 years. All these facts make whales one of the most extraordinary and fascinating animals on earth.",
