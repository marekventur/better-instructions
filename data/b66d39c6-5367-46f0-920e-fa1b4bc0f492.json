  "input": "",
  "output": "It is predicted that the new popular fashion trend for the fall season will be knee-length, oversized trench coats with wide lapels. Trench coats paired with ankle boots and belts are expected to be extremely popular and will be seen on the streets, Instagram, and fashion magazines. The trend is expected to be a combination of comfort and chic, making it perfect for those autumn days when it is slightly chilly but still warm enough to wear a light coat. This is an ideal transition piece for the transition between season and we expect it to dominate the fall 2020 fashion scene.",
