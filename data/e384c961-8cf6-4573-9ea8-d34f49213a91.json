  "input": "",
  "output": "Technology has changed the way people communicate by enabling them to communicate quickly, easily, and efficiently, without the need for physical interaction or face-to-face interaction. This can be seen through the proliferation of texting, emails, social media, and other communication apps which allow people to communicate with others who are located far away. Additionally, technology has enabled people to share their ideas and stories with others more easily, and has allowed for more collaboration and communication between people who may have otherwise been unable to do so.",
