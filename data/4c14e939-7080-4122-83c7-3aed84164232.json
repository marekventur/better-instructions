  "input": "",
  "output": "An AI system typically consists of three key components: a data source, an algorithm, and a learning model. The data source is the starting point, providing the AI with information to work with. The algorithm is the code that enables the AI to manipulate the data according to set rules and parameters. The learning model is used to adjust the AI's understanding of the data as it encounters more information. Ultimately, the AI's output is produced by a combination of these three components.",
