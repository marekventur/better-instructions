  "input": "Climate change is becoming an increasing concern across the world as temperatures continue to rise and record levels of extreme weather events are recorded. This is due to the human action of creating greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, which trap heat and act like a blanket around the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The effects of climate change are already being witnessed, from floods to droughts, and are expected to even worsen if the climate is allowed to continue heating up. Therefore, it is vital for people to reduce the production of greenhouse gases, through sustainable and renewable energy sources, as well as other proactive measures.",
  "output": "Climate change has become a global concern, as temperatures continue to rise and human-caused greenhouse gas emissions trap heat and work like a blanket completely surrounding the atmosphere. This is already leading to extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, and the situation is expected to worsen if the climate continues to heat up. To mitigate the consequences of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is essential to transition to more sustainable and renewable energy sources and take other proactive measures.",
