  "instruction": "Generate an algorithm that can solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm would first accept an input that consists of the cities to visit and the distances between each pair of cities. Then it would use an optimization algorithm such as dynamic programming or simulated annealing to generate the best tour. The output of the algorithm would be the optimal tour and its corresponding total distance travelled.",
