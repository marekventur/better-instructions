  "output": "To paint a room, start by clearing the room and covering furniture and floors in drop cloths. Then, wash down the walls and let them dry. Next, use masking tape to tape up trim, windows, and doors. After the areas are taped, apply an even coat of primer or sealer with a roller or paintbrush. Allow the primer or sealer to dry, then apply a coat of paint. Make sure to use an even, overlapping stroke when painting. Once the first coat is dry, apply a second coat if needed. Finally, remove the o tape, let the paint dry, and enjoy your newly painted room.",
