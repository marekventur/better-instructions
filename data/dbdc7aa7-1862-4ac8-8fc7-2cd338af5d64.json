If possible, position it away from any sources of distraction such as TVs or computers, and make sure it is free of clutter and other distractions. The room should have enough space to spread out textbooks, notes, and other materials, and it should be equipped with any necessary supplies such as a laptop, pen, paper and textbooks.
