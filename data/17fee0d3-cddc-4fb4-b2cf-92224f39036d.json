  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a magical tree on the edge of a small village. It was said that if you whispered a wish to the tree, it would bring that wish to life.\n\nOne night, a young girl named Eliza stumbled upon the tree and made a wish for a true friend. The next day, she woke up to find an adorable puppy lying at the foot of the tree. The puppy was her true friend, given to her from the tree.\n\nFrom then on, Eliza and her pup were inseparable. Everywhere she went, her pup was with her. She would take him for walks, feed him his favorite treats, and tell him stories before bed.\n\nThe magical tree continued to bring true friends and wishes to life for many years until one day, it mysteriously vanished. The villagers were devastated but comforted by the idea that the tree had left to find other villages in need of its magical powers.",
