  "output": "To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless classic that tells the story of the lost innocence of childhood in a small southern town. Through the narrator, a gutsy young girl Scout, the reader is taken on a journey exploring the themes of racism, injustice, and human goodness. The characters are well-drawn, the dialogue is sharp, and the surprise ending packs a powerful punch. It is a book that will stay with you long after you read the last page.",
