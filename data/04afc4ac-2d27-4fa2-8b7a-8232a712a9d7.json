  "output": "Cultural relativism is the principle that an individual's beliefs and activities should be understood by others in terms of that individual's own culture. It recognizes that a person's values, beliefs, and behaviors are shaped by their culture and that different cultures have different norms and values. Cultural relativism also holds that all cultures are equally valid and should not be judged against a single standard.",
