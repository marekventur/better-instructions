  "output": "I would create an explanatory hypothesis for the observation that more young people are taking up apprenticeships than ever before. My hypothesis would be that the rising cost of college tuition and the lack of available jobs are driving young people to pursue apprenticeships instead. With college tuition fees rising and low-paying jobs being the only option in many areas, young people are turning to apprenticeships as an alternative way to gain skills and experience without having to take on student loan debt. This is resulting in more young people taking up apprenticeships and pursuing career paths outside of the traditional college route.",
