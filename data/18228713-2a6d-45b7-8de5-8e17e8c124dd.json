  "output": "In a future world, humanity no longer needs to worry about the day-to-day aspects of life. Everything is automated by robots, whose innovative AI technology is able to swiftly resolve any issue that humans used to have to face. Robots work together in perfect harmony, acting as a centralized system of management that keeps everything running smoothly. They are even responsible for socializing and entertaining people - from organizing festivals to hosting parties, robotics offers a new way of living. Human beings have plenty of time to do what they truly want, and not be bogged down by the mundane tasks that used to take up a lot of time.",
