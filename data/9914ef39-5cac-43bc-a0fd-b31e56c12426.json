  "instruction": "Design a bridge for a river with a width of 35 meters.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The bridge should be designed as an arched bridge with two 35-meter-long spans. The arch should rise at least 5 meters from the base of the river, allowing for enough clearance for boats to pass underneath. The two sides of the bridge should be connected with a central pier at least 10 meters tall to provide additional support.",
