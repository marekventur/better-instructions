  "output": "The perfect romantic getaway should be full of moments to cherish. It should be a place where you can relax and unwind while spending quality time with your loved one. Spend time exploring the natural beauty of your destination, take scenic walks along the beach or in the countryside, and enjoy special meals together. Relax in comfortable accommodations and pamper yourselves with a massage or spa treatment. Stroll through local shops and eat desserts at a cozy cafe - indulge in activities that will make the getaway romantic and memorable. Make sure to dedicate time for the two of you to simply be together and discuss your hopes and dreams.",
