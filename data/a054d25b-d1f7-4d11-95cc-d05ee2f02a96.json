  "output": "Five categories of food dishes are appetizers, soups, salads, main courses, and desserts. Appetizers usually involve small, light dishes served before the main meal. These include finger foods, dips, and other quick snacks. Soups are usually combined with a liquid and some type of vegetable or meat. Salads are usually composed of greens, fruits, and other ingredients. Main courses usually involve heavier dishes such as pasta, fish, meat, and vegetables. Desserts are usually sweet treats served after the main meal, such as cakes, ice cream, and pastries.",
