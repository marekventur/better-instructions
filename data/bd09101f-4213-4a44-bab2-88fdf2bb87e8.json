  "instruction": "Explain the concept of 'Gini co-efficient'.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The Gini co-efficient is a metric used to measure the inequality of distribution of wealth or income in a given population. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing perfect equality, and 1 indicating perfect inequality. It is calculated by first dividing a given population into different income groups, and then calculating the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality. If a population's Gini co-efficient is closer to 1, it means that the wealth or income distribution in that population is unequal or skewed.",
