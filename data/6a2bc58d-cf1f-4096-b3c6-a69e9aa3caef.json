  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a civil lawsuit and a criminal lawsuit is that in a civil lawsuit one party sues another party in an effort to make them pay damages, while in a criminal lawsuit one party sues another in an effort to make them pay a penalty to the government. In a civil lawsuit the penalty is known as damages, and can include payment for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and economic losses. In a criminal lawsuit the penalty is known as a sentence, and can include jail or prison time, fines, and other punishments.",
