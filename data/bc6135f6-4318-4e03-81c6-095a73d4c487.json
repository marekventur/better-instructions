  "instruction": "Identify the type of energy used in this device and explain why.",
  "input": "This device is a solar-powered watch.",
  "output": "The device uses solar energy as its power source. This is because solar energy is an abundant, renewable resource that produces no pollution and is free to use. Solar cells in the watch convert the sun's energy into electricity, which is then used to power the watch. This helps to minimize the need to replace or recharge the batteries in the watch, which makes it an ideal choice for eco-friendly and sustainable living.",
