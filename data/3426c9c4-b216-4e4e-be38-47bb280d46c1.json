  "output": "A realistic scenario that illustrates the potential of 3D printing involves a medical patient who needs a replacement prosthetic limb. Through 3D printing, the prosthetic limb can be custom-designed to fit the patient perfectly and produced quickly and cost-effectively. This technology can make a life-changing difference for someone who may not have had access to a quality prosthetic limb before.",
