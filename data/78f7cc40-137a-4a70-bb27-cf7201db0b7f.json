  "output": "A simple question-answering system should have at least three components for it to be working effectively: a natural language processing (NLP) system, a knowledge base of facts, and a database of answers retrieved from the knowledge base.\n\nNLP is used to interpret natural language questions, identify relevant terms, and extract structured information directly from the user query. This information is used to search the knowledge base and retrieve the most useful answers. The knowledge base consists of previously collected facts, which can range from encyclopedic information to definitions, facts, and figures. The answers can be stored in a database in simple data structures such as text, images, and videos.",
