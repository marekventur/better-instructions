  "instruction": "Explain the difference between a long-term goal and a short-term goal.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Long-term goals are broader goals that are usually achieved over a period of months or years. They are typically more ambitious and require sustained effort and dedication. Short-term goals, on the other hand, are smaller goals achieved in a short period of time. They are typically easier to achieve and have a direct application to long-term goals. For example, a long-term goal might be to get a higher-paying job, while a short-term goal to reach that goal could be to attend a seminar or complete a training program related to the job.",
