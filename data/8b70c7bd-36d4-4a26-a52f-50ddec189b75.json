  "instruction": "Describe the problem that this algorithm solves.",
  "input": "Random Forest",
  "output": "Random Forest is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can provide accurate, fast and reliable predictions. It works by creating multiple decision trees and combining the predictions they generate to produce more accurate results than with a single decision tree. The algorithm is able to identify the importance of different features, which can be used for feature selection and to improve accuracy. Additionally, Random Forest reduces overfitting and performs well even on large, complex datasets. It is a supervised learning algorithm, which means that it can generate predictions from labeled data. This makes it an ideal tool for classification tasks, such as classifying customers for marketing or analyzing medical records for diagnostics and treatments.",
