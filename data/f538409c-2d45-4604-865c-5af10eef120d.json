  "output": "AI can be used in agriculture to automate the process of crop monitoring and management. AI-powered automated systems can be used to monitor soil conditions, track plant growth, and identify potential pests and diseases in order to increase yields, improve crop health, and reduce the use of chemicals and other resources. The systems can also be used to optimize irrigation and fertilizer use, as well as to predict future crop production. AI-powered systems can also provide actionable recommendations for improving crop yield and sustainability.",
