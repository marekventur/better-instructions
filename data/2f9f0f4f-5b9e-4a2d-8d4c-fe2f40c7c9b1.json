  "instruction": "Write a few sentences comparing the old smartphones to the new ones.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Old smartphones had significantly less processing power and storage compared to modern phones. They also used to be much bigger in size, and the charging ports were less universal. In contrast, modern smartphones are much more capable with faster processing power and larger storage. They also tend to be smaller in size and have universal charging ports. In addition, modern phones have more advanced features such as access to streaming services and pay-as-you-go plans. They also have much better camera quality, so users can take photos and videos with greater clarity and detail.",
