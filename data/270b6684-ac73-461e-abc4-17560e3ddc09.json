  "input": "",
  "output": "A possible solution to reduce food waste is creating an online platform that serves as an intermediary between food businesses and households. In such a platform, food businesses such as restaurants and supermarkets can upload food waste they can\u2019t sell and households can purchase this food at cheaper prices. This is beneficial to both the business owners, who find an appropriate channel to dispose their food waste, and households, who can purchase food at reduced prices. \nAnother potential solution is creating an app that helps individuals and households track their grocery purchases and leftovers. This app can help monitor and record the amount and types of food people buy, as well as leftover produce households create.",
