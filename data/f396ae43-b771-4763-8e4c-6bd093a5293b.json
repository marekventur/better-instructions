Every morning, she turned into a wolf and ran around the city before turning back into a human. Asha was fascinated by the different abilities each animal had and enjoyed discovering new things. One day, she stumbled upon a mysterious dark cave and decided to explore it as a wolf. As she ventured further into the cave, she began to feel the power of transformation leave her. When she emerged, she was no longer a wolf, but an eagle. She soared over her city, seeing the world in a new and amazing way. From that day on, she embraced her newfound power and used it to explore the world.",
