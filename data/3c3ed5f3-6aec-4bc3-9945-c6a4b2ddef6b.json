  "input": "",
  "output": "Writing a song starts with having a concept or theme in mind. From there, you can start sketching out music ideas and arrangement ideas. You can record simple ideas using a computer or an audio recorder. Then comes the lyric writing process. Writing lyrics involves mapping out what you want to say, coming up with clever word play and metaphors, and being able to write about your experiences and emotions in a compelling way. After that comes the melody and chord progression. You may have to go back and forth between chord progression/melody and lyric writing until it all fits together. Finally, it's time to produce the song by adding instrumentation and sound effects, mixing and mastering.",
