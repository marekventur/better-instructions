  "input": "Polar bear and Grizzly bear",
  "output": "Polar bears and grizzly bears are both large and powerful animals, but they differ in various ways. Polar bears are adapted to live in cold, icy habitats while grizzly bears can inhabit relatively warmer climates such as mountains and woods. Additionally, polar bears are white or cream in color and have thick fur that keeps them warm in the freezing temperatures, while grizzly bears have more varied coloration and a shorter and coarser fur. Polar bears also tend to be slightly larger in size than grizzly bears and have a sturdier build to support their weight on icy surfaces.",
