  "input": "",
  "output": "The device is a visor with adjustable lenses that can be worn over each eye. The lenses are designed to quickly scan text and project images of the contents of the text onto the user\u2019s field of vision. It is adjustable to different reading speeds and has built-in speech recognition software that translates the text into audio. The device also features sensors that measure eye movements to increase the user\u2019s reading speed.",
