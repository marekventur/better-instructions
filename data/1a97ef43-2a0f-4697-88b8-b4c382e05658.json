  "output": "An exoskeleton is an external supportive structure made of rigid material, such as metal, that is worn by an organism over its natural body. It provides protection and support to the organism and can be designed to supplement or replace missing or damaged parts of the body. Exoskeletons can be powered by the organism, manually operated, or powered by an outside source. Examples of exoskeletons include those used by insects, lobsters, and crabs, as well as those used by humans for medical and industrial purposes.",
