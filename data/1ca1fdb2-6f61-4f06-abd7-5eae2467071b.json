  "output": "Living in a big city has its pros and cons. On the one hand, living in a big city offers convenient access to numerous amenities and resources, such as public transportation, better medical facilities, a wide array of cultural events, and employment opportunities. On the other hand, living in a big city can be costly and stressful, as there will often be crime, a higher cost of living, and longer working hours due to increased competition. Ultimately, whether living in a big city is worth it or not depends on the individual's preferences, lifestyle, and budget.",
