  "output": "Last year, one of the biggest challenges I had to overcome was learning how to manage my time and energy more effectively. Working full-time while completing a university degree can be physically and emotionally taxing, and I\u2019ve had to learn how to prioritize my time while balancing my workload. \n\nAt first, I found it difficult to focus on my studies while dealing with the stress of work and school. But I eventually developed a better system to work smarter and not harder. I implemented better time management strategies such as breaking down tasks into more manageable and achievable goals. I also learned to take better care of myself by eating and sleeping better, and making time for activities that I found enjoyable. Overcoming this challenge has been a lot of hard work, but it has been very rewarding.",
