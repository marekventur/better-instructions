  "instruction": "Construct a visual representation of the following two equations.",
  "input": "x + 2y = 6\n3x - 4y = 4",
  "output": "The visual representation of the equations would be a graph with x-axis and y-axis, representing the x and y variables respectively. There would be two lines: one representing the equation x + 2y = 6 and the other representing the equation 3x - 4y = 4. The two lines intersect at the point (2,1) which is the solution for the system.",
