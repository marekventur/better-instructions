  "output": "Volunteering abroad is something that more people should consider if they\u2019re looking for a meaningful way to make a difference in the world. It\u2019s a unique way to gain firsthand experience, explore a new culture, and meet new people. But an often overlooked benefit of international volunteering is the potential to create a lasting, global impact. \n\nFor many years, the idea of volunteering abroad has been associated with the clich\u00e9 of idealistic, college-aged students trying to \u201cmake a difference\u201d in developing countries. Although volunteering abroad can still mean working with a local community on important initiatives to improve people\u2019s lives, there are now a variety of programs that allow people to pursue a variety of initiatives\u2014medical, educational, environmental, and more\u2014in subtler, often more successful ways. \n\nInternational volunteering projects are invaluable in developing countries where resources are limited and locals are using innovation to make a difference. Many volunteers are able to create sustainable projects with an emphasis on the community\u2019s input, needs, and abilities. These projects allow for an influx of outside knowledge and expertise in a way that cannot be explained through traditional aid practices. \n\nIt\u2019s often thought that volunteering abroad is too expensive or unsafe for anyone to participate. Websites such as Global Volunteers provide important resources for volunteers willing to work abroad, including information about destination safety, fundraising advice, and project tracking.\n\nAt the end of the day, international volunteerism provides incredible value to both the volunteers and the communities they serve. Volunteering abroad gives volunteers the opportunity to learn, help others, and explore a new culture in an incredibly hands-on way. Simultaneously, volunteer projects travel long distances, showing communities that people in other countries care about their situation, and providing access to valuable skills and resources.",
