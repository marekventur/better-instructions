  "input": "",
  "output": "Direct complexity is the number of steps required to solve a problem, while indirect complexity measures the amount of time it will take to complete a given task. Direct complexity focuses on the raw number of logically distinct operations that need to be performed, while indirect complexity looks at the size of the inputs to operations and how frequently the operations need to be executed.",
