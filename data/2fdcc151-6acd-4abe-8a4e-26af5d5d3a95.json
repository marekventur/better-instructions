  "input": "",
  "output": "Technology has had a major impact on global warming, both positive and negative. The production of electronic devices and other machinery results in the release of a substantial amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change. On the positive side, technological advances in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, as well as the increasing use of electric cars, have helped reduce carbon emissions. Other technologies such as efficient energy management systems and carbon capture and storage systems can be used to reduce emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.",
