  "input": "",
  "output": "The use of television advertising in the 2006 and 2008 election cycles is similar in terms of candidates and interest groups utilizing TV ads to promote their campaigns and advocacies. However, in terms of spending, the 2008 cycle has seen almost double the amount of money spent on TV advertising compared to the 2006 cycle. In the 2008 cycle, there has been an increased focus on issue advocacy by interest groups, as well as an increase in TV production costs enabling more candidates to use television advertising.",
