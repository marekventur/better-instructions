The battle began when Japanese forces attempted to capture Midway Island in order to use it as a base for further operations. U.S Navy forces, aided by a decoded Japanese plan, were able to inflict a heavy defeat on the Japanese forces, sinking four of their aircraft carriers, sinking a significant number of other ships, and damaging several more, while suffering only minor losses.",
