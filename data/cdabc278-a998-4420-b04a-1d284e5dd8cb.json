  "input": "",
  "output": "Person 1: I think social media has had a positive impact on society.\nPerson 2: I disagree! Social media has created a lot of division in the world and has caused people to be more disconnected than connected.\n\nPerson 1: But social media has allowed people to organize protest movements, continue conversations about current issues, and stay connected even when separated by geography.\n\nPerson 2: Yes, but it\u2019s also created an environment of division and comparison, where it can be very easy to lose touch with reality. \n\nPerson 1: That\u2019s true, but it has also enabled people to find and build relationships with people from different backgrounds, from all around the world. \n\nPerson 2: That is true, but it has also opened the door for trolls, bullies, and malicious actors who spread hateful rhetoric. \n\nPerson 1: That\u2019s a valid point, but I still think that, overall, social media has had a positive impact on society.",
