  "input": "",
  "output": "Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning it absorbs infrared radiation and traps heat inside the atmosphere. This increases the temperature of the planet, leading to global warming and climate change. Thus, the more carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere, the more extreme the effects of global warming and climate change.",
