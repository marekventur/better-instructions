Air pollution is caused by sources such as burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, and transportation. Water pollution is caused by sewage and industrial waste, runoff from farms and lawns, and improper disposal of hazardous materials. Land pollution is caused by incorrect disposal of hazardous materials, overuse of land for development, and dumping of non-biodegradable materials. These sources of pollution can be harmful to the environment and human health.",
