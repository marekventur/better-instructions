  "output": "A balanced diet plan for a 14 year old adolescent to lose 5 pounds would include three meals and two snacks daily with a focus on nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods, like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins. Meals should also include healthy fats, such as nuts, avocados, and olive oil. For breakfast, try a whole-grain cereal with almond milk, sliced banana, and walnuts. For lunch, have a fish sandwich on a whole-grain roll with lettuce and tomato, and an apple. For dinner, have roasted vegetables and grilled salmon, with a salad. Snacks can include an apple with peanut butter, a smoothie with yogurt and fruit, or a few whole-grain crackers with hummus. Make sure to drink lots of water throughout the day and get plenty of rest and physical activity.",
