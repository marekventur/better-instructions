  "input": "",
  "output": "The internet is a global network of connected computers and devices that can send and receive data. It works by using a network of computers and servers to store and share data. When you make a request on the internet, your computer sends a message to the server that holds the requested data. That server then sends a response back to your computer. This process is enabled by a series of protocols and standards, including HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol. This process happens in milliseconds and allows users to access data almost instantly.",
