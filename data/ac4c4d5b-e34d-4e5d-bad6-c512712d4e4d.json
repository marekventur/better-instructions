  "instruction": "Design a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The neural network should be designed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). \nThe first layer of the model should be a 2D convolutional layer to extract features from the input images. It should be followed by pooling layers for feature selection. A dense layer should then be added to classify the digits. The output layer should consist of 10 neurons, one for each digit. The model should be trained on a dataset of labelled handwritten digits, and the performance should be tested to evaluate the accuracy of the model.",
