  "input": "",
  "output": "A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a type of machine learning algorithm that pits two AI models against each other. These models are known as the generative model and the discriminative model. The generative model creates new data (such as images or text) while the discriminative model evaluates the data produced by the generative model. The generative model uses the feedback from the discriminative model to continuously improve its output, eventually producing data that is indistinguishable from \u201creal\u201d data.",
