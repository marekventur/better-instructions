  "input": "",
  "output": "The causes of World War II were the unresolved issues of World War I, including Germany's desire for more territory and opportunities for growth, the oppressive Treaty of Versailles, the rise of facism and militarism, and the failure of the League of Nations to address international conflicts in a peaceful manner. These factors led to aggression, alliances, and ultimately the war itself. \n\nThe effects of World War II were far-reaching. It was the deadliest conflict in history, with an estimated 70-85 million lives being lost. It caused an economic boom for the Allied (winning) countries, and a depression for the Axis (losing) countries. It also ushered in an era of nuclear weapons and the Cold War with its created tension between the East and West.",
