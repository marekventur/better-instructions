  "output": "Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort required to complete a task. It is affected by factors such as the length of the task and the complexity of the problem. The cognitive load on a person is affected by the materials they are using, the nature of instructions they are following, and the environment they are in. The aim of cognitive load theory is to minimize the amount of mental effort needed to complete a task by designating appropriate amounts of information.",
