  "output": "Email and text messaging are two popular forms of communication. Email is widely used for business and professional communications, while text messaging is typically used for personal messaging. Emails are typically longer and more structured in their form, while text messages are shorter, and can often be sent quickly without much thought. Emails are often used for more formal conversations, whereas text messages can be used for informal conversations. Emails are usually private, whereas text messages generally can be seen by anyone with access to a phone.",
