  "output": "One effective way to de-escalate a dispute between two people is to set aside time and come up with a plan together. This plan should include rational and constructive steps to explore and address the issues of the dispute. This could include having the parties express and reflect on their feelings, raising and acknowledging valid points, and brainstorming solutions or compromises. By providing a calm and safe environment and focusing on understanding, communicating, and resolving the conflict, it is possible to de-escalate the dispute and find a mutually acceptable solution.",
