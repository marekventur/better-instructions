  "input": "",
  "output": "The majority of tarantulas are not poisonous, with less than 1% actually being dangerous to humans. The ones that are considered dangerous have a neurotoxin in their venom and can cause pain, swelling, and possibly an anaphylactic reaction in some people. However, such tarantulas are not actually lethal and typically only cause an unpleasant sensation. Tarantulas that are not considered poisonous usually have a defensives mechanism of urticating hairs that can cause irritation in the skin and mucous membranes.",
