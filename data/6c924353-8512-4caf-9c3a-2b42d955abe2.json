  "input": "",
  "output": "One possible solution to help improve air quality in cities is to encourage the use of electric vehicles and discourage the use of gasoline-powered cars. Public transportation systems can also be improved to reduce the number of cars on the road. Additionally, renewable energy sources can be used to power businesses and homes in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Promoting green infrastructure such as green roofs, urban gardens, and green streets can also help improve air quality by providing more natural vegetation that can absorb pollutants. Finally, incentives for businesses to reduce their emissions can help to encourage companies to adopt more eco-friendly practices.",
