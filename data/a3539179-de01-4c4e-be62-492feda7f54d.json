  "output": "The ideal primary school classroom environment is one that is both stimulating and relaxed. It should be filled with activities that engage and challenge students, but also allow them to explore, express themselves, and learn through play. There should be plenty of space for children to move and explore, as well as plenty of tools and materials for experimentation and creative problem-solving.",
