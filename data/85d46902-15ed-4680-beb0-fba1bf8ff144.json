  "output": "When a father turns to crime, the consequences for a family can be devastating. The father's criminal activity can instill mistrust and fear in their children, who may develop behavioral and social problems from this type of upbringing. The entire family may suffer from financial hardship due to the father's criminal activities and the need to use funds to secure legal representation. Additionally, family relationships can become strained, as the father's criminal record may impact their ability to find employment. The family may experience feelings of shame, guilt and embarrassment, leading to further isolation, depression, and anxiety.",
