This lion was very well known by the other animals of the forest for his sage advice and a gift for understanding life\u2019s greatest mysteries. \nOne day, a group of squirrels, rabbits, and birds had a disagreement about who was the most important. To settle the matter, the animal decided to visit the wise lion and ask his opinion. \nThe lion listened to their arguments and said, \u201cThere is no one single most important animal. We are all important and needed in our own way. Each of you have your own unique gifts that make the forest a better place to live.\u201d \nThe animals all took this advice to heart and learned to appreciate each other for their individual roles in the forest.",
