  "input": "",
  "output": "An artificial neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that is designed to imitate the biological neural networks found in the human brain. Its purpose is to enable computers to process information in a more human-like way and to make automated decisions based on input. Artificial neural networks can be used for many different types of tasks, from predicting stock market prices to recognizing objects in images. The benefits of using artificial neural networks are that they can make decisions faster than humans and can detect patterns in data more accurately than humans.",
