  "instruction": "Why are coral reefs dying?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Coral reefs are dying due to a variety of human activities, such as climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, and water pollution. Rising sea temperatures caused by global warming can cause coral bleaching, which is the loss of coral 's symbiotic zooxanthellae algae. Ocean acidification, the increasing acidity of ocean water, can also make coral reefs difficult to survive in. Additionally, damaging fishing practices, such as bottom trawling, can damage or destroy large areas of coral reefs. Finally, water pollution from agricultural run off and sewage can lead to excessive growth of algae, which can overwhelm and smother the coral.",
