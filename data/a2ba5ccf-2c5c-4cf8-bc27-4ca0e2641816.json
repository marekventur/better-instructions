  "input": "",
  "output": "Data preprocessing is the process of preparing data for further analysis. It typically involves cleaning the data, exploring the data, and transforming the data into a format that can be more easily processed by a machine learning algorithm. Preprocessing includes steps such as data cleaning, imputation of missing values, normalization, data reduction, and feature engineering. Data cleaning is the process of removing invalid or incomplete records from the data set. Data exploration involves exploring the dataset to better understand the data and identify potential problems. Data transformation involves transforming the data into a suitable format, such as scaling and encoding. Data reduction is the process of reducing the data set while still preserving the information needed for further analysis. Feature engineering involves creating or manipulating features that can be used in machine learning algorithms.",
