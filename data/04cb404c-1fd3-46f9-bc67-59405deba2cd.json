  "input": "",
  "output": "The most common techniques for solving a system of linear equations are substitution, elimination and graphing. Substitution involves replacing the variables with known values and solving for the unknowns. Elimination involves adding or subtracting linear combinations of the equations to reduce the number of equations and variables. Finally, graphing involves plotting the equations on a graph and analyzing the intersection of the lines.",
