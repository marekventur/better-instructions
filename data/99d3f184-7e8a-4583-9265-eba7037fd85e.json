  "output": "The anatomy of a bicycle consists of a frame, two wheels, handlebars, pedals, a seat, and brakes. The frame is the skeletal structure that holds all of the other components together and supports the rider's weight. The two wheels are positioned parallel to each other and are connected to the frame by axles. Handlebars are used for balance and for steering the bike. Pedals are connected to the bottom of the frame and the rider uses their feet to propel the bike forward. The seat is connected to the frame and is adjustable to the rider's height. The brakes are usually attached to either the handlebars or pedals, and are used to stop the bike.",
