  "output": "A straw hat, a cotton sleeveless top, a pair of high-waisted shorts, and a pair of sandals would be a great choice for a day at an outdoor picnic! The cotton material of the top would keep you cool, and the shorts will give you enough room to move around. The sandals have a breathable material that will help keep your feet cool and comfortable. And the straw hat will provide some much-needed shade for your face.",
