  "input": "",
  "output": "Businesses can utilize customer feedback to improve customer service by periodically surveying customers about their experience. The surveys can be conducted through customer service calls, emails, or online questionnaires. This customer feedback can be used to identify areas of service that customers find lacking or areas of improvement that can be made. Companies can then create tasks and objectives to address any identified customer service issues. Additionally, the customer feedback can be used to shape customer service trainings, ensure that customer service staff are properly trained and familiar with customer service policies, and create action plans to ensure customer satisfaction.",
