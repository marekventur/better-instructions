  "input": "Behavior: cry.",
  "output": "Crying is an emotional response to a variety of internal and external stimuli. It is thought to be caused by an increased level of stress hormones such as cortisol, noradrenaline and prolactin, as well as the neuro-modulating hormone, oxytocin. It is also believed to be a way for people to express and cope with their emotions, and to release endorphins which help reduce stress.",
