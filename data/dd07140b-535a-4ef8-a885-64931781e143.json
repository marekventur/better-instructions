  "output": "A good strategy to manage stress is to practice mindfulness and stress-reducing activities on a regular basis.

Additionally, take time to relax with activities such as reading, listening to music, or spending time in nature. These activities can help keep your mind and body in balance and help reduce stress. \nFurthermore, try to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating a balanced diet and getting sufficient sleep. Avoid overworking yourself, and set reasonable expectations for yourself and those around you. Make sure to take regular breaks and set aside time for yourself and your hobbies.",
