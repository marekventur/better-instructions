  "input": "Text: The cat is running.",
  "output": "The numerical representation of the text, \"The cat is running\" is [3, 10, 0, 4, 5, 2, 4, 6]. The encoding scheme used is a 0-indexed counting scheme, where eachword is assigned a numerical representation based on its index in the text. In this example, \"The\" is 0, \"cat\" is 1, \"is\" is 2, and so on.",
