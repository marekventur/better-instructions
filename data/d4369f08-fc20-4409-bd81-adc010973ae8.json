  "input": "",
  "output": "Buying locally produced goods and services can be beneficial to the local economy. By purchasing local products, more money is kept in the local community, which can stimulate economic growth. Additionally, local businesses are more likely to source their supplies from nearby suppliers, helping to reduce pollution and transportation costs. Additionally, buying local provides people with access to locally made products which might not be available elsewhere, and these products can often be of higher quality than mass-produced imports. Buying local also helps to create and sustain employment opportunities in the local area, strengthening the local community.",
