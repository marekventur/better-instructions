  "input": "",
  "output": "No, zodiac signs are not real in a scientific sense. While the astrological signs might give insight into people's personalities and trends in their lives, there is no evidence that they have any bearing on reality. Astronomically, the constellations associated with the zodiac signs have shifted significantly since the Babylonians first created the zodiac system more than 3,000 years ago. Additionally, modern scientific studies of human personality have not consistently found that people born in the same astrological sign have similar personality traits.",
