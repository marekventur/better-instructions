  "output": "When it comes to physics, nothing is quite as fascinating as inertia. Inertia is the tendency for an object to resist being pushed or pulled and to continue doing whatever it was doing before. For example, if you're pushing a car, you need to use a lot of force in order to get it moving. But once the car is moving, it takes much less force to keep it in motion. This is because the car has inertia, meaning it has its own natural tendency to keep moving in the same direction. The more mass an object has, the more inertia it will possess. This is why boats and planes need to expend even more energy in order to take off \u2013 the greater mass means it will take even more force to get them going. Inertia is an essential part of our understanding of physics and is one of the main factors that ensure we will stay safe in everyday life.",
