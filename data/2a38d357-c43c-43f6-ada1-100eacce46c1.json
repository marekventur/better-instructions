  "input": "Board game",
  "output": "I would use Twitter to promote a board game by creating engaging content in the form of videos, photos, and tweets. I would also include relevant hashtags so that the message reaches a wider audience. I would also include links to the website or product page and encourage users to share the content. Additionally, I would also use influencer marketing where I reach out to popular influencers in the board game industry and have them promote the product on their social media profiles.",
