  "instruction": "Write a paragraph describing the technique used to design a bridge.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Designing a bridge requires careful consideration of many factors such as bridge type, loading condition, construction materials, structural system and wind/seismic requirements. When designing a bridge, engineers need to take into account the stresses that the structure will need to withstand, such as compression, tension and shear. The size and type of the bridge, as well as its location, will all cause different design considerations. It is important to choose construction materials that are strong, yet cost effective. In addition, engineers will calculate the forces of gravity, wind and temperature on the bridge in order to make sure that it is suitable for the environment.\n\nOnce construction is complete, the bridge closes the gap between two points, connecting people, communities and places that may have once been separated.",
