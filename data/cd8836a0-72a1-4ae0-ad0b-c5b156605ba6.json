  "output": "Today marks a major milestone for space exploration, as SpaceX successfully launched its first crewed space mission. On board were veteran space explorers Bob and Sue, who will be the first humans to travel to a destination beyond Earth's orbit in nearly a decade. The new space mission is expected to gather valuable data and insights into the universe beyond our world. \n\nThe launch was a huge success, with SpaceX and the astronauts on board reporting a smooth, stress-free launch and flight. The mission has been several years in the making, with the first test flight taking place in May 2020 and a third, successful uncrewed mission carrying out in October. \n\nWith this new mission, SpaceX has come one step closer to realizing its mission of making space exploration more accessible and affordable. Bob and Sue are expected to complete their mission and return to Earth safely within the next few weeks.",
