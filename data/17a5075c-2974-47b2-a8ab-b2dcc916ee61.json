  "input": "COVID-19 has created significant upheavals in the global economy, as has been evidenced by plummeting industrial output, weakened confidence in investments, and other indicators of economic malaise. People have been laid off from their jobs, industries have seen their businesses struggling, and the difficulty of maintaining the physical distancing measures have further hampered global economic growth. Governments have been quick to respond, introducing stimulus packages aimed at stabilizing their economies, while also attempting to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on their people.",
  "output": "COVID-19 has caused major downsizing in the global economy, with industrial output decreasing, investors losing confidence, and people losing their jobs. To address these issues, governments have enacted stimulus packages to try and stabilize their economies.

Moreover, the pandemic has had a tremendous effect on the lives of people, drastically altering their quality of life. The response to this has been encouraging in many countries, and governments are doing their best to counter its crippling effects. However, the long-term consequences of the pandemic are yet to be seen.",
