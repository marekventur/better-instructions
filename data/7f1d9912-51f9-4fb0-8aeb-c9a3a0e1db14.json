  "output": "The best way to avoid a traffic jam is to plan ahead. Check local traffic reports before heading out, and if possible, leave a bit early to try to beat the rush. If a traffic jam is unavoidable, try to alternate between different routes so that you can find less crowded streets. You can also download smartphone apps to help track traffic and keep you updated on the fastest route.",
