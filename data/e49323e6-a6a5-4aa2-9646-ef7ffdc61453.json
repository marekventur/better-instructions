  "input": "",
  "output": "Hyperparameter optimization is the process of tuning hyperparameters in a machine learning model to obtain optimal performance on a given task. Hyperparameters are parameters which are not learned during model training, but instead are set prior to training and influence the model's behavior. Examples include the learning rate, the number of layers and neurons in a neural network, the regularization strength, etc. Hyperparameter optimization is the process of finding the best combination of these hyperparameters which results in the model achieving the best performance on the given task.",
