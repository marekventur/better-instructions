  "input": "",
  "output": "The fundamental principle behind the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely you measure the momentum of a particle, the less precisely you can measure its position. This is due to the fact that the act of measuring a particle's momentum will cause its position to become uncertain, and vice versa. This affects the behavior of quantum systems in ways that are not seen in classical systems.",
