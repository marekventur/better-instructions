  "instruction": "Given a hate crime incident, explain why it qualifies as a hate crime.",
  "input": "A group of teens attacked a homeless man and shouted homophobic slurs at him.",
  "output": "The attack on the homeless man qualifies as a hate crime because the attack was motivated by a bias or prejudice against the man's sexual orientation. The attackers' use of homophobic slurs further confirms that the attack was motivated by hate rather than some other type of crime, such as robbery or assault.",
