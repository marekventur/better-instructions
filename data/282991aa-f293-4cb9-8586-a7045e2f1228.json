  "input": "Climate change has caused extreme weather events to become more common and more intense. Rising temperatures are melting the polar ice caps, causing sea levels to rise and flooding coastal areas. Heat waves are becoming more common and last longer, while intense droughts can cause crop failures. Weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, also become more powerful.",
  "output": "Climate change has brought about a range of drastic changes to our weather patterns. Global temperatures have been steadily rising, leading to the melting of polar icecaps and a subsequent rise in sea levels. Further, heat waves are increasing in intensity and have become more long-lasting, resulting in droughts that have caused severe crop damage. Also, weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes have become more powerful and frequent. Clearly, climate change has had a profound effect on the Earth\u2019s weather.",
