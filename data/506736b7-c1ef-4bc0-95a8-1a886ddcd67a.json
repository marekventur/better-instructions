  "output": "Genetic drift is a phenomenon in which genetic variation within a population is reduced due to a random sampling of individuals. This random sampling can occur in a wide range of situations, but its most common occurrence is when a population is small in size or isolated. Over time, this can result in changes in the genetic makeup of a population, as certain genes become either more or less common. This has important implications for the diversity and health of populations.",
