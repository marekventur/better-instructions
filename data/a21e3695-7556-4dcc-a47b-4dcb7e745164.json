  "output": "The old man stepped into the dark woods, his shaky steps echoing off the trees. He had no idea why he was there, but he felt as if he was meant to be there. He paused and looked around, and noticed a faint glimmer of light in the distance. With a newfound sense of purpose, he started walking towards it. As he got closer, he could make out a small cottage nestled amongst the trees. He stumbled up to the door and knocked, unsure of what to expect. The door opened, and a kindly old woman stood before him. She beckoned for him to come in, and he suddenly found himself in a warmly lit room, a fire blazing in the hearth.",
