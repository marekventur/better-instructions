  "output": "The dusk was drawing near and the teenager could feel in her bones that something sinister was in the air. She had decided to take a walk through the woods near her house, but soon found herself deep within the forest. As she was trekking, she heard loud, ominous noises that seem to come from all around her. With her heart pounding in her chest, she slowly made her way through the darkness. Suddenly, she felt a cold, clammy hand wrap around her neck and before she could scream, she found herself dragged away into the shadowy depths of the forest. \n\nFor days, she was held captive by her captors, fearing for her life. Eventually, she was able to escape her prison, but the horrors she had witnessed would haunt her for the rest of her life. Unaware of what lurked in the darkness, she made her way back home, but she could never forget her harrowing experience in the forest.",
