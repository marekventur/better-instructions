  "input": "",
  "output": "Dropping out of high school can have long lasting consequences, with economic and social consequences being some of the most significant. Economically, those who do not complete high school often face reduced earning potential, difficulty finding stable employment, and higher poverty rates, while those with at least a high school diploma are better able to pursue their career goals. In addition, those without a high school diploma also tend to be excluded from certain social opportunities, as an education is often a requirement for jobs, internships, and college. In terms of mental health, dropping out of high school is associated with higher rates of anxiety and depression, as well as poorer overall physical health. As a result, these individuals often feel isolated and may lack self-confidence and opportunities for social interaction and self-fulfillment. Moreover, leaving school without graduating can often lead to long-term unemployment, making it difficult to re-enter the job market without upgrading skills or attaining a diploma or degree.",
