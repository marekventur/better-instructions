  "output": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence which allows systems to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed. It involves building models of data to make predictions and decisions, based on previously observed data. By using algorithms to identify patterns in data, machine learning can automatically adjust its algorithms without human intervention. This enables the system to continually learn and improve its accuracy as more data is added.",
