  "input": "",
  "output": "A top-down approach is a strategy where a problem is broken down into smaller components. Solutions for those components are then derived based on the overall goal. In the top-down approach, the solution is developed based on abstract principles and goals, and the details are filled in later. On the other hand, the bottom-up approach starts with the details and works towards the overall goal. Solutions are developed by building upon the basic elements and constructing the larger concept from them. The top-down approach is often used in organizations or when making policy decisions, while the bottom-up approach is often used in the development of a product or system.",
