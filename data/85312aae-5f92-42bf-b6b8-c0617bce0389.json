  "input": "",
  "output": "Aerobic respiration is a complex process that requires four steps in order to generate energy. The first step is glycolysis, in which glucose is broken down into pyruvate molecules. Next, the pyruvate molecules are converted into a molecule called acetyl CoA. In the third step, a series of metabolic pathways produce molecules of ATP, the energy used to power cells. Lastly, the aerobic respiration process is completed by the release of carbon dioxide and the oxygen used in the first step.",
