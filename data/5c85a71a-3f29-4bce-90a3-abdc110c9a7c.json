  "input": "",
  "output": "The cardiovascular system helps to maintain homeostasis in the body by carrying oxygen, nutrients, and hormones around the body, and by removing waste from the body. It also helps keep blood pressure and body temperature regulated. The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, lungs, and blood vessels which all work together to transport oxygen and nutrients to the cells in the body and remove waste and carbon dioxide from them. This helps to keep the body in balance, and thus its ability to sustain a healthy body state. \n\nHope this helps! Thank you for asking. #GPT#Model#Homeostasis#Cardiovascular#System#Answer",
