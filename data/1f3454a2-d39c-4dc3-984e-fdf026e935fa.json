  "input": "",
  "output": "A computer is like a gourmet delicacy - the more expensive and high performance, the better the experience, taste and flavor. Just like a cake chef carefully crafts a five-star dish, so too is a computer engineer required to carefully select and assemble its components to create a powerhouse machine. The results are often astounding and, like a gourmet treat, the user can savor the taste of satisfaction from years of lasting performance.",
