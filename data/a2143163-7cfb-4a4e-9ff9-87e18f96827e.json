  "instruction": "Construct a paper airplane and explain the physics of its flight.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A paper airplane is constructed by folding paper into a small planar structure. When launched, the paper airplane utilizes four forces of flight - lift, drag, thrust and weight - in order to fly. Lift is generated by differences in air pressure as the air flows over the wings, while drag is created when the viscous air particles in the atmosphere affect the airflow around the wings. Thrust is created by the momentum of the paper airplane when thrown and weight is the force of gravity pulling the object towards the ground. These four forces of flight work in harmony to allow the paper airplane to complete its desired flight path.",
