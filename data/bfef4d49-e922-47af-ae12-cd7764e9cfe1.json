  "input": "",
  "output": "The main differences between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells are that prokaryotic cells are much simpler in their structure and organization. Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus, instead having their genetic material dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand, possess a membrane-bound nucleus which contains all of the genetic material of the cell. Additionally, prokaryotic cells are usually much smaller than eukaryotic cells and do not possess other organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria.",
