  "input": "The effect of heavy metals on plant growth",
  "output": "An experiment could be set up to test the effect of heavy metals on plant growth by growing two groups of plants in the same soil type, but with different levels of heavy metals present. The amount of growth and health of the plants at different stages of the experiment could be measured and compared to determine how the presence of heavy metals impacts plant growth.",
