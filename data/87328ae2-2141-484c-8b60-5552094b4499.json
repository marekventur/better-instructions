  "input": "",
  "output": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to learn from data and improve performance on a task without explicit human programming. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from large amounts of data and make predictions. Deep learning is more powerful and accurate than traditional machine learning, but also requires more computing power.",
