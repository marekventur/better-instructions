  "input": "",
  "output": "The presence of oceanic heat storage plays an important role in regulating the climate. Heat stored in the ocean helps keep the temperature of the atmosphere in balance by redistributing warmth in the form of currents around the globe. In addition, the ocean serves as a buffer against rapid changes in temperatures, creating a stabilizing influence. Furthermore, the ocean absorbs a large portion of the excess heat generated by human activities, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change.",
