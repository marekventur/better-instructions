  "input": "",
  "output": "Los Angeles is located in a wide basin in the heart of Southern California and stretches out along the surrounding coastal mountain ranges. The central city is primarily flat, with its major transportation arteries, freeways, and metro railway hubs crossing the area in a crisscross pattern. The northern parts of the city are much hillier, as the San Gabriel Mountains rise more than 5,000 feet above the city's downtown. The eastern parts of the city are somewhat eroded, as the San Fernando Valley is bound by the Verdugo and San Gabriel Mountains.",
