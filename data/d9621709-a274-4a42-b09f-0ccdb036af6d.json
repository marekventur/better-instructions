  "input": "",
  "output": "Industrial robots are typically used for repetitive tasks in hazardous environments and tend to be very expensive to purchase and maintain. They are used in a variety of sectors including automotive, aerospace, manufacturing and electronics and are generally bolted to the floor and separated from people. On the other hand, collaborative robots (cobots) are designed to safely work alongside people, with their focus on safety, efficiency and flexibility. Cobots are ideal for small to medium-sized tasks and are generally much more cost-effective than industrial robots. Furthermore, they are mobile, lightweight and are designed with sensors and motion control to detect humans and react accordingly.",
