  "output": "A skin biopsy is a procedure in which a small part of skin is taken to examine it under a microscope. The procedure starts by cleaning and numbing the area. The skin is then cut with a scalpel, and the specimen is taken by removing a small piece of the skin. Then, a small stitch is used to close the wound and a bandage is placed over the area. The entire process can take 15-20 minutes.",
