  "output": "Artificial intelligence can be applied in the medical industry through the use of medical diagnosis tools.  AI-powered medical diagnosis tools can help to lower misdiagnosis rates, as they can recognize and interpret medical data more accurately than humans. These tools are able to analyze patient data such as test results, medical imaging, and symptoms to diagnose and recommend the best treatment for the patient. AI-powered medical diagnosis tools can also help to reduce costs, as the process is faster and more efficient compared to traditional methods.",
