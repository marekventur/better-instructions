  "output": "Fruits and vegetables are both nutrient-dense and provide essential vitamins, minerals and antioxidants to human diets. However, they are also different in many ways. Fruits are often eaten as snacks and are sweet in taste, while vegetables are usually part of meals and have a savory taste. Fruits typically consist of one or more edible seeds, while most vegetables do not contain any seeds. Fruits tend to have higher levels of carbohydrates than vegetables, and are also generally sweeter due to their higher sugar content. Vegetables generally contain higher amounts of fiber and protein, and a greater range of vitamins and minerals.",
