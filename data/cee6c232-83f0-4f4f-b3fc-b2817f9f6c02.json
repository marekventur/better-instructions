  "input": "",
  "output": "The Southern and Northern Lights, also known as the aurora australis and aurora borealis respectively, are natural light displays that occur in the night sky near the Arctic and Antarctic. The two are caused by the collision of solar particles with the Earth's magnetic field. The Southern Lights occur mainly from a circle around Antarctica, while the Northern Lights occur mainly in a circle around the North Pole. The two displays differ in color and intensity, with the Northern Lights typically being more vivid and dynamic.",
