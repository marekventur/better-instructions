  "input": "",
  "output": "The brain recognizes faces by using a complex network of neurons distributed across different areas of the brain. It first processes basic elements of a face such as lines, shapes, and color, and then proceeds to interpret more complex cues such as the location of eyes, the shape of the mouth, and so on. Ultimately, the brain is able to quickly identify someone\u2019s face even with small changes in their appearance, making it one of the most powerful recognition processes in the human brain.",
