  "input": "",
  "output": "The leaves of orange, fluttering to the ground, \nReminiscent of days no longer around.\nCold winds blowing, gentle and mild,\nReminding us of autumn's graceful style.\nThe leaves slowly decaying, in colors no doubt,\nOrange and yellow, forever they shout. \nAs the weather turns ever so cold,\nAutumn's beauty will certainly unfold.",
