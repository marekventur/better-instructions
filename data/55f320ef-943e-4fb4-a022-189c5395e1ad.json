  "output": "One of the major problems related to climate change is the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and cause temperatures to rise, leading to more extreme weather events and rising sea levels. This can have a devastating effect on ecosystems around the world, causing mass extinction of species, destruction of habitats, and other negative consequences.",
