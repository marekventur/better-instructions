  "output": "Once upon a time, I felt a love so strong,\nSparking a fire inside me that could not go wrong.\nIt changed me for the better, a love so divine,\nMy heart filled with joy, it was all so sublime.\n\nThe love I felt so deeply made all else seem bland,\nNothing could stop its power, it ran through my hand.\nMy feelings so alive, I could never pretend,\nKnowing I'd found a love that would never end.\n\nAnd when I held hands with you, everything felt right,\nMy heart singing its song to me in the night.\nThough storms may come and block the sunshine,\nOur love remains, a beacon of light.\n\nBut life has its twists so we did part,\nStill the love I felt will remain in my heart.\nThough our time together may have had an early start,\nI know that I will love you forever, if only in my heart.",
