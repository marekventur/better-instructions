  "input": "",
  "output": "The loud noise coming from outside the house could be from construction workers or from nearby road traffic. It could also be from nearby events like music concerts or festivals. There is a possibility that the noise could be from maintenance and repairs; for example, if there is a heating or air conditioning system near the house. If you are unsure, you could open the windows and doors to listen more closely, or ask your neighbors if they know what the noise is.",
