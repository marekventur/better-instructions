  "input": "",
  "output": "A relay is an electromagnetic switch that is used to control a circuit using a low power electrical signal. It works by using an electromagnet to open or close the switch to either allow or block the flow of electricity through the circuit. When the electromagnet is activated by low power electrical signal, it causes the switch to open and allow the electrical current to flow through the circuit, and when the power to the electromagnet is removed, the switch closes and the current can no longer flow.",
