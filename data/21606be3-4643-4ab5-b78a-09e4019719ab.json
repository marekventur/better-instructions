  "output": "Here is a plan to save money on groceries: \n- Plan meals in advance and make a list of only the items needed. This will help you avoid impulse purchases. \n- Shop the perimeter of the store where the fresh items are located. Processed and pre-packaged foods are usually located in the center aisles and tend to be more expensive. \n- Look for store brand or generic items as they are usually cheaper than name brands. \n- Buy what is in season as it is typically less expensive. \n- Buy in bulk when an item is on sale. Buy only what you are sure you will use. \n- Use coupons from the store\u2019s circulars, newspapers, or online. \n- Consider buying in bulk from an online grocer that may offer lower prices than your local store. \n- Skip pre-cut fruits and vegetables and buy them whole. \n- Eat healthier by substituting fresh fruits and vegetables for processed and pre-packaged foods. \n- Look for the store loyalty card program that can provide additional discounts and savings. \n- Shopping alone will prevent you from spending extra money. \n- Pay with cash instead of a credit card as studies show that people tend to spend more when they use credit cards. \n- Buy discounted items that are near their expiration date. \n- Look for cheaper, healthier alternatives. \n- Avoid pre-made meals as they can be expensive and not very healthy. \n- Buy store brand spices and seasonings as they can offer considerable savings. \n- Consider purchasing items in bulk that you use often while checking to make sure you are getting the best price. \n- Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for a discount or negotiate the price. \n- Look for hidden discounts or deals such as buy one get one free promotions.",
