  "output": "The most difficult medical condition to diagnose is Lyme disease. It is hard to detect due to its wide range of symptoms and the fact that the bacteria can manifest in various parts of the body. In addition, the primary symptoms of Lyme disease such as a bullseye rash and flu-like symptoms may not always be present. Therefore, it can be challenging for a medical professional to correctly recognize and diagnose Lyme disease.",
