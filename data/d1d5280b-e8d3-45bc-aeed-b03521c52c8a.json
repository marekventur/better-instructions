  "input": "",
  "output": "Hurricanes form over warm ocean waters when moist air rises quickly and is pushed by strong winds. As the air rises and cools, it condenses into clouds, releasing heat into the atmosphere, which further fuels strong updrafting winds and rising air. This repeating cycle of warm moist air rising and cool air sinking is the primary engine of a hurricane.",
