  "instruction": "Explain the concept of photoelectrical effect.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in physics that occurs when a metal surface absorbs electromagnetic radiation and releases electrons. When photons, or particles of light, are incident on a metal surface, the photons are absorbed by the electrons in the metal, causing them to be ejected from the surface. This causes the release of electrical energy in the form of electrons, and is referred to as the photoelectric effect. The phenomenon is used in various applications and technologies, such as solar cells, photomultipliers, and light detectors.",
