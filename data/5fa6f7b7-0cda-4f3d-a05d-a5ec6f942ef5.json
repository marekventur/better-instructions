  "input": "",
  "output": "The elements in the Periodic Table are named according to the atomic structure of each element. They are named according to the number of protons they contain. Generally speaking, if an element has one or a two-letter symbol, the element will be named using its atomic number (the number of protons it contains). If the element has a three-letter symbol, it will be named using the element's common or trivial name.",
