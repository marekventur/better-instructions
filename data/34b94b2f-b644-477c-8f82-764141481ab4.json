  "input": "",
  "output": "A paradigm shift is a fundamental change in the way we think about a particular concept. It is the process of replacing an established model or framework of thinking for a new one. Paradigm shifts usually occur when a large number of people abandon the old ideas for a new way of thinking that produces different results. Examples of paradigm shifts include the Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution, which profoundly changed the way society is structured and operates.",
