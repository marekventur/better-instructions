  "output": "The code of conduct for our youth sports team aims to create a positive and respectful environment. We expect all participants to behave in a manner that reflects the values of teamwork, commitment, respect, sportsmanship, and inclusivity. We ask that mistakes are acknowledged and that participants treat referees, coaches, and opponents with respect. We also discourage negative or unsportsmanlike behaviour, such as taunting or arguing with referees.",
