  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary difference between a grocery store and a farmer's market is the type of produce being sold. Grocery stores typically sell produce that has been trucked in from large-scale farms around the country, and often from overseas. Meanwhile, farmer's markets feature produce that is grown locally, by smaller-scale farms. Additionally, some farmer's markets may also sell handmade crafts, baked goods, and other artisanal products.",
