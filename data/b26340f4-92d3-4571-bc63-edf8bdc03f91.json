  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between homogenous and heterogeneous mixtures is the uniformity of their components. Homogenous mixtures dissolve completely into each other, creating a consistent composition throughout the entire mixture, while heterogeneous mixtures contain visible components that are not uniformly distributed throughout and remain distinct. For example, a sugar solution is a homogenous mixture, while a trail mix is a heterogenous mixture.",
