  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference in roles and responsibilities between Senior and Junior Developers is the level of experience and autonomy. Senior Developers are expected to have more technical expertise, be able to lead projects and act as a mentor for junior developers. Senior Developers coordinate their work with other departments and manage their own tasks, also handling last-minute changes, if required. Junior Developers are entry-level employees with less experience who are expected to take on simpler tasks as instructed by senior developers. They also engage in development projects to build up their experience but are supervised closely by Senior Developers.",
