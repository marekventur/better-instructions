  "input": "",
  "output": "Printed newspapers and online news outlets have many similarities and differences. On the one hand, both varieties provide the same type of content \u2014 news \u2014 to the same types of audiences. However, there are key distinctions between these two media formats. Printed newspapers are typically delivered daily and offer a more in-depth analysis from reporters, whereas online news outlets are updated in near real-time and are often more opinion-focused. Printed newspapers are often offered for free or for a low subscription fee, whereas online news outlets tend to be free, ad-supported operations. Additionally, printed newspapers tend to follow a broader geographic area, while online news outlets tend to focus on specific regions, cities, and topics.",
