  "input": "",
  "output": "Interrupt Vector Tables (IVT) are a type of memory storage location where information about the Interrupts that a computer can generate are stored. The IVT is a table of memory addresses where the operating system will go when an Interrupt has been triggered. Each entry in the IVT stores the address of an interrupt handler, which is typically a routine or procedure that performs the desired response to a particular interrupt signal. When an interrupt signal is detected, the system will look at the IVT and jump to the appropriate interrupt handler.",
