  "instruction": "Propose an alternative solution to the following problem:",
  "input": "The current system of food delivery is inefficient and leads to wastage.",
  "output": "One possible solution to the current system of food delivery is a food delivery app that would connect restaurants and customers directly. Customers can order from a large selection of restaurants on the app and receive the food quickly. Restaurants can keep track of orders and manage deliveries with built-in GPS technology. Additionally, the app can be linked to a payment system for secure transactions. This solution would reduce food wastage, as the app would match customers with the closest restaurants, reducing delivery times.",
