  "instruction": "Develop a scheme to shift the following data",
  "input": "Grocery store data",
  "output": "A suitable scheme to shift grocery store data could involve the use of a cloud-based platform to store the data. For instance, the platform could provide different levels of access to the data depending on the user's role. It could also provide the necessary tools and APIs to easily migrate the data and integrate other applications with the platform. Additionally, security measures, such as encryption, could be implemented to protect the data from external threats.",
