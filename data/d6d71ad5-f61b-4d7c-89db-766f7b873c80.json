  "output": "Birdsong is praised for its complexity and beauty, but the language of birdsong is even more fascinating. Scientist J. David the movie maker discovered that birdsong is more sophisticated than most humans giving languages credit for. The language of birdsong is composed of 15 basic sounds, arranged into distinct syllables in order to communicate.
