  "input": "",
  "output": "The causes of the French Revolution were largely rooted in the country's economic and social inequalities. The French people were heavily taxed while the privileged class enjoyed their lavish lifestyles. This caused widespread discontent among the peasants, which in turn weakened the power of the monarchy. Additionally, many of the Enlightenment ideas championed by intellectual and social networks had spread amongst the people, leading to the emergence of revolutionary ideals of democracy, liberty, and equality. These ideas further weakened the long-standing power structures and provided the rallying cry for the revolutionaries.",
