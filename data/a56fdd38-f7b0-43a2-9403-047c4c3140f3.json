  "instruction": "How does the law of demand influence pricing strategies?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The law of demand states that there is an inverse relationship between price and demand. This means that as price increases, demand decreases and vice-versa. Therefore, pricing strategies seek to balance the law of demand by setting prices that are high enough to generate a profit, but low enough to maximize demand. This balance must also take into account other factors, such as the cost of production, to ensure that the prices set are reasonable.",
