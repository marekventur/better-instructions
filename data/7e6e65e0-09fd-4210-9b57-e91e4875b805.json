  "output": "He saw himself reflected in the mirror and frowned. Those weren't his emerald eyes anymore, they were now a dull, lifeless grey. His head was shaved, a sign of the times and a sign of surrender. His once pristine face was covered in soot and dirt, a sign of the struggle that had lasted for months. He hadn't seen himself in a mirror for a long time and knew the transformation was to be expected. He knew that he had changed and a part of him felt strange and uncomfortable with it, yet a deeper part wanted nothing more than to accept it.\n\nHe sighed and continued his day's journey. He had come to this city to find supplies and scavenge for food, but he had yet to find what he was looking for. His unending determination pushed him forward, and it was the same determination he saw in himself in the mirror. Maybe that was what he was here for - to discover new strength and courage. He continued on his way, his reflection watching him all the while.",
