  "instruction": "Create a movie soundtrack from the following list of songs.",
  "input": "- Uptown Funk - Bruno Mars\n- Brave - Sara Bareilles\n- I'm Yours - Jason Mraz\n- Shiny Happy People - REM\n- All of Me - John Legend",
  "output": "The opening sequence to the movie should start with Uptown Funk by Bruno Mars to bring a lively and fun energy to set the scene. The main character's journey can then be supported by Brave by Sara Bareilles, conveying the strength and courage needed to conquer any obstacle. When the main character is feeling lost, I'm Yours by Jason Mraz will remind them of their path. Shiny Happy People by REM will add a sunny and optimistic feeling as the main character gets closer to meeting their goals. Finally, All of Me by John Legend captures the moment of achievement and celebration.",
