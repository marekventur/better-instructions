  "output": "A current event in the news related to healthcare is the rising demand for telehealth services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many healthcare organizations are adopting telehealth solutions to provide patients with the care they need. This has enabled them to reduce wait times, increase access to care and provide limited health care settings.
