  "input": "",
  "output": "Its best to use heuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and greedy algorithms to solve an N-P hard problem. These algorithms are designed to provide approximate solutions to a complex problem, often finding solutions of reasonable quality in a reasonable amount of time.",
