  "output": "Research shows that automation has had a significant impact on job security worldwide. Automation has replaced many jobs in the manufacturing and other sectors, reducing the demand for manual labor and causing job insecurity. Automation has also enabled businesses to increase productivity, optimize processes and reduce costs. Automation also requires fewer skilled workers, and this has had a particularly strong impact on blue collar workers, who traditionally held positions in industries like manufacturing. The prevalence of automation has also generated issues such as deskilling and displacement of certain types of workers. This has caused a shift in job security, with demand for higher-skilled workers with greater adaptability to new technologies. \nIn addition to negatively impacting job security, automation has also been found to decrease wages. A 2018 study by the University of Michigan found that between 1990 and 2007, the implementation of industrial robots led to a decrease in wages of up to 3%. Automation also led to an increase in inequality, as workers in industries affected by automation suffered a greater decrease in wages than those in unaffected industries.\n\nOverall, automation has had a negative impact on job security as well as wages, with a larger impact among blue collar workers. It has also caused a shift in the type of job security, as the demand has moved towards those with higher-skilled jobs and greater adaptability to new technologies. Automation has also increased inequality, as those affected by automation have suffered a greater decline in wages than those in unaffected industries.",
