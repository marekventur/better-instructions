  "input": "",
  "output": "Aristotle and Socrates had different views on many topics, including knowledge, morality, and justice. Aristotle believed in the idea of essentialism, arguing that knowledge can be obtained through the study of phenomena in their respective disciplines. Socrates, however, argued for the 'Socratic method' of inquiry, which claims that knowledge can be gained through questioning and assessing the beliefs and opinions of others. Moreover, Aristotle believed in a virtuous approach to morality, while Socrates adhered to absolute morality. Lastly, Aristotle thought justice could be obtained through the careful application of laws and regulations, while Socrates believed that justice must come from a higher power.",
