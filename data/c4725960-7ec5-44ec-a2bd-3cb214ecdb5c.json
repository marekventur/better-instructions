  "output": "Technology has been used to improve healthcare in countless ways. For example, telemedicine has been used to expand access to specialized care, allowing doctors to provide care for patients remotely via secure, online video conferencing. Wearable health devices and remote patient monitoring systems have also been adopted to track and record vital signs of patients in real-time, allowing for more accurate diagnosis and proactive treatment. Additionally, automated technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, have been used to help automate administrative tasks and streamline processes, both in the healthcare industry and in medicines themselves. By leveraging technology, healthcare providers are able to provide higher-quality care while improving efficiency, which ultimately results in improved patient outcomes.",
