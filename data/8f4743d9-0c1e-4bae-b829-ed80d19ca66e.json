  "input": "",
  "output": "The concept of six degrees of separation suggests that any two people in the world can be connected through a chain of acquaintances with no more than five other people in between. This concept was popularized by a 1967 paper by the psychologist Stanley Milgram, who hypothesized that everyone is connected by six degrees of separation. This theory has since been supported by social media studies, which show that individuals are increasingly connected through ever smaller networks.",
