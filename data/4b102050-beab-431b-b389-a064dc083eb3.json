  "instruction": "Predict the possible outcomes of the following situation.",
  "input": "A student studying for an important exam has to decide between going to bed early or staying up late to study.",
  "output": "If the student decides to go to bed early, they may have limited time to study, but will be more rested and have better focus. If they decide to stay up late and study, they may run the risk of exhaustion and reduced concentration. In either case, the student must also weigh the amount of information needed for the exam and determine if it is feasible to finish in the allotted time.",
