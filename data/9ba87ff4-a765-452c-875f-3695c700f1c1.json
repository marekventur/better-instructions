  "input": "The Cuban Missile Crisis",
  "output": "It was October of 1962 when the world was put on the brink of nuclear disaster. The US and the Soviet Union were locked in a tense standoff, when the US discovered that the Soviets had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. In response, the US imposed a naval blockade to prevent the delivery of more missiles. Days of negotiations followed, with the world holding its breath. But in the end, a compromise was reached and the crisis ended without any further escalation of conflict. Even so, the Cuban Missile Crisis provided a powerful lesson of the fragility of peace in the nuclear age.",
