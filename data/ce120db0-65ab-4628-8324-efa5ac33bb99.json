  "input": "",
  "output": "Atmospheric pressure affects weather in important ways. Lower air pressure indicates that a storm is likely, while higher air pressure is associated with clear skies. Higher air pressure compresses air near the surface, preventing air from rising, while lower pressure allows air to rise and form clouds and precipitation. This is why low-pressure areas are more likely to experience rain, thunderstorms, and other inclement weather.",
