  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change can have a major impact on crop yields. Rising temperatures, longer growing seasons, and higher levels of atmospheric CO2 can all contribute to increased crop yields. However, higher temperatures can also lead to drought and decrease crop yields, while extreme weather events such as floods and hurricanes can also lead to significant crop losses. Additionally, climate change can cause pests, weeds, and diseases to become more severe, leading to losses in crop yields.",
