  "input": "",
  "output": "The history of artificial intelligence began in the 1950s, with the development of early computers and the first attempts to create programs that could make decisions on their own. Early successes in the creation of chess-playing computers and automated theorem-proving programs paved the way for further research. As the technology improved, so did the development of robotic machines, capable of interacting with their environment and executing commands. In the intervening decades, groundbreaking results have been achieved in the fields of machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Today, artificial intelligence is driving the development of new products and services far beyond what humans could have imagined before.",
