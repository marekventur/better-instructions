  "output": "1. Word Embeddings: word embeddings are used to represent each word in a corpus as a vector that captures its semantic and syntactic properties.\n2. Sequence Models: this is a type of learning algorithm that uses data with prior order information. This allows the model to learn temporal relationships in data.\n3. Neural Networks: neural networks are used to detect complex relationships and patterns in data. They are particularly effective for tasks such as identifying entities and classifying documents.",
