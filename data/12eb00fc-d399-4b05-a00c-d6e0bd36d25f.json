  "output": "Once upon a time, there was an old baker who had a secret recipe for the best chocolate chip cookies in the world. Every time he made them, they tasted delicious, with just the right amount of sweetness and melted chocolate chips. As the years went by, everyone in the village came to know his secret and his cookies became the most sought after treat. Even now, whenever the villagers need a Pick-me-up, they just head to the baker's house for a sweet treat of some of his delicious chocolate chip cookies.",
