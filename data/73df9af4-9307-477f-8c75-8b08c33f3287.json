  "output": "The US Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are two of the most important documents in American history. The Declaration of Independence is a statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress in 1776 which declared the colonies' right to self-governance and separation from Great Britain. The US Constitution, adopted in 1787, laid out the structure of the US government and enumerated the rights of individuals. Both documents are based on the shared belief of individual rights and liberties. The Declaration of Independence was used to justify the war for independence and the US Constitution is the legal foundation for the US government and its laws.",
