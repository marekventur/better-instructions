  "output": "The Battle of Gettysburg was a turning point in the American Civil War and was fought over the course of three days in July 1863. Confederate General Robert E. Lee led the Army of Northern Virginia in the south, while Union forces were led by Major General George Gordon Meade and his Army of the Potomac. Battles commenced on July 1 and went on until July 3. The Union forces suffered around 23,000 casualties while the Confederates suffered almost 28,000. In the end, a Union victory was achieved, leading to Robert E. Lee's retreat and a major loss for the Confederacy. Gettysburg was a major turning point in the war, with the Union forces taking back the initiative and ultimately leading to the Confederacy's surrender on April 9th, 1865. It was the largest battle ever fought in the Western Hemisphere, and was an invaluable milestone in the march to securing the Union's victory.",
