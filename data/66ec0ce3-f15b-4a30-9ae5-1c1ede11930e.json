  "output": "The automobile industry has evolved over the past century to become what it is today. In the early 1900s, cars were made with basic technology and sold to the wealthy population. Over time, advances in technology have allowed for mass production of cars, as well as the consumer availability of luxury models. Automobile technology has changed drastically over the years, from manual transmissions to the modern automatic ones, from carburetors to fuel injection systems, and from basic steel frames to advanced aluminum or composite bodies. The automobile industry has shaped our modern lives, ultimately revolutionizing transportation and transforming our cities.",
