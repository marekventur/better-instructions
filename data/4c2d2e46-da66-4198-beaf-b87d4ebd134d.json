  "output": "The most common use of the derivative in calculus is to determine the rate of change of a function at a given point. It is also used to find the slope of a graph at a given point, to find the maximum and minimum points of a function, and to calculate the area under a curve. The derivative is also used to study the behaviour of curves at the boundaries of an interval and for solving certain types of optimisation problems.",
