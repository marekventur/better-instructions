  "input": "Researchers have successfully sequenced the genetic code of the largest organism known to exist \u2013 a tree species named the Hyperion.",
  "output": "In a groundbreaking development, scientists have announced the successful sequencing of the genetic code of Hyperion, the world's tallest tree species. This breakthrough provides a significant expansion of our understanding of the genetic complexity among large and ancient species. Research from this discovery promises to open new insights into the evolutionary history and development of trees, as well as help to better protect them and ensure their continued presence in nature.",
