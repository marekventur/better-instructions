  "instruction": "What type of relationship exists between voltage and current in an electric circuit?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "In an electric circuit, voltage and current have a proportional relationship. This means that as voltage increases, so does current, and as voltage decreases, current decreases as well. This relationship is known as Ohm's Law and can be expressed mathematically with the equation I = V/R, where I is the current, V is the voltage, and R is the resistance.",
