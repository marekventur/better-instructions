  "input": "",
  "output": "The law of conservation of energy is demonstrated in a yo-yo as the energy provided by the pull of the string is dissipated when the yo-yo reaches the end of the string. This energy is converted into potential energy which, once the yo-yo reaches the apex of its swing, is converted back into kinetic energy, allowing the yo-yo to return to the hand of the user.",
