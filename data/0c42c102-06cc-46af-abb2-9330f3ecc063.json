  "output": "Air is a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen (78% by volume), oxygen (21%) and smaller amounts of argon, water vapor, carbon dioxide and other trace gases. Air is often described in terms of its physical properties, such as its temperature, pressure, density, and volume. Air has the property of being compressible, meaning that its volume changes with changes in pressure. At sea level and with a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, air has a density of 1.2 kg/m3 and a pressure of about 1.01325 bar.",
