  "instruction": "Generate a neural network architecture for a binary visible object detector.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The architecture of the neural network should begin with a convolutional layer with a 3x3 filter and a stride of 2. This should be followed by another convolutional layer with a 3x3 filter and a stride of 1. This should be followed by a max pooling layer with a 2x2 filter and a stride of 2. After this, there should be two more convolutional layers and a fully connected layer. The output should be a binary visible object detector.",
