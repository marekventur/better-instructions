  "instruction": "Form a hypothesis on the relationship between ocean temperature and rate of photosynthesis.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "My hypothesis is that as ocean temperature increases, the rate of photosynthesis will also increase. This is based on the fact that photosynthesis is a process which relies on the availability of light and heat, and higher temperatures provide more of both. Additionally, higher temperatures provide an ideal environment for certain species of algae which are key producers of oxygen and energy in the ocean.",
