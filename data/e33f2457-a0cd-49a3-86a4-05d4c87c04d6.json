  "input": "https://examplearticle.com",
  "output": "Education can promote global understanding by helping to develop critical thinking skills, teaching students about the cultural norms of other countries, and providing access to resources and courses that provide an in-depth look into different cultures, religions, philosophies, and worldviews. By having an understanding of international cultures and perspectives, students can have a better understanding of how their own culture, values, and beliefs compare to others, and how to collaborate and work together with people from different countries.",
