  "output": "It was a dark and stormy night. The wind howled through the trees and the rain pounded relentlessly against the windows. Mary nervously paced around her house, each step echoing through the darkness. Suddenly, a loud knock echoed from the door. Mary slowly opened the door and saw a haggard man standing in the doorway. She asked who he was, but the man didn't answer. He just stood there, silently staring at her. Mary tried to shut the door, but the man pushed his way inside. He slowly advanced towards her and she backed away, holding onto the wall for support. Mary was filled with terror, unsure of what the man was going to do next. Suddenly, the lights went out, plunging the room into darkness. Mary heard the man slowly walk away, but she was too afraid to do anything. The nightmare was far from over.",
