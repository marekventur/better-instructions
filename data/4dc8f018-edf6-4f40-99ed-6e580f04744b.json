  "output": "Civic education is an essential part of cultivating a well-rounded and engaged citizenry. It is the study of the rights and responsibilities of citizens, and helps to develop the skills and knowledge needed to take part in meaningful civic discourse and action. Civic education helps individuals to become more informed on issues of public policy, allows them to develop more meaningful relationships with their communities, and gives them the tools they need to advance the common good. Additionally, it can foster critical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making skills as well as a sense of civic responsibility and a commitment to the public good. Civic education sets the foundation for a more engaged, thoughtful, and accountable citizenry and is a key component of democracy.",
