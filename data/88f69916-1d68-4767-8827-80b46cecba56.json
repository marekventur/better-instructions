  "input": "",
  "output": "Team sports have many advantages over individual sports. They provide opportunities for members to learn teamwork, collaborate, and support one another. Team sports also present more opportunities for social interaction, since members of the team are more likely to form bonds with one another. In individual sports, however, it is easy to become isolated since the focus is on the individual's performance instead of the team. Another major difference between team sports and individual sports is the differing requirements for practice. In team sports, players must often practice together. In individual sports, however, practice is individualized, allowing players to tailor practices to their own strengths and weaknesses.",
