  "input": "",
  "output": "Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is an alkaline powder that reacts with acidic ingredients such as yogurt, buttermilk, chocolate, and cocoa. Baking powder (a combination of baking soda plus one or two acids) produces carbon dioxide when moistened, creating bubbles that lighten and soften baked goods. Baking soda is mostly a single-acting ingredient, while baking powder is double-acting and produces gas when moistened and then again during baking. Baking soda is slightly finer than baking powder and produces a slightly bitter taste. Baking soda is more potent in smaller amounts compared to baking powder.",
