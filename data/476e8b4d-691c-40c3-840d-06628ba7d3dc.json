  "instruction": "Construct a system for categorizing customer inquiries by type.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The system for categorizing customer inquiries depending on their type is a complex process which consists of multiple steps. First you will need to set up customer profiles, where customer information is gathered and stored. Second, the customer inquiries should be divided into categories, such as billing and technical support, so they can be separated. Third, a customer feedback system should be set up to track customer inquiry trends and common questions. Finally, customer inquiries should be manually classified into categories, such as billing and technical support, based on the customer\u2019s profile and the customer\u2019s feedback. \n\nOnce the categorization system is in place and organized, customer inquiries can quickly and easily be sorted into the appropriate categories. This system will not only help customers receive the support and information they need, but also help customer service staff quickly identify the type of inquiry and provide an appropriate and timely response.",
