  "input": "",
  "output": "The purpose of a library in a computer program is to provide the program with code for performing specific tasks, such as manipulating characters or files and network programming. This code can be stored and accessed whenever the program needs to use it, and the library can be updated or modified as required. The advantage of using a library is that it allows the program to access code that has already been tested and debugged, which reduces development time and effort. It also enables the reusability of code between different programs.",
