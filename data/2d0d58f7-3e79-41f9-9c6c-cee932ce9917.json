  "output": "The human digestive system consists of the digestive tract, a series of hollow organs connected in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus, as well as several other organs that produce and secrete digestive chemicals. The main components of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, gallbladder, large intestine, and anus. Each of these organs is responsible for performing specific vital functions in the digestion process. The mouth breaks down food with saliva and teeth for swallowing, the esophagus carries food to the stomach, the stomach breaks down food with gastric juices, the small intestine absorbs nutrients, the pancreas produces enzymes for digestion and hormones for regulation, the gallbladder stores and secretes bile, the large intestine extracts water and salts from the remaining indigestible material, and the anus eliminates waste from the body.",
