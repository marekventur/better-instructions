  "instruction": "Pick a random song and create a dance routine for it",
  "input": "\"Just a Dream\" by Nelly",
  "output": "My dance routine for \"Just a Dream\" by Nelly would start off gentle with sweeping arm movements that gradually build up in complexity. The chorus is a great opportunity to get up on your feet and start moving more energetically with the beat, adding some hops and jumps. For the second verse, introduce some new moves to mix it up, like funky hip shaking and shimmying. As the song draws to a close, gradually slow down your dancing and end on a graceful and emotional note.",
