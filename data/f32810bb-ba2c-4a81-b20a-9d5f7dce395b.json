It was a lot taller than he expected and he was scared. But he gathered his courage and started to climb. At first, he was scared and he nearly lost his grip twice, but eventually, he reached the top. From there, he saw the entire world resting in his hands and he felt liberated. From that day, Tommy was no longer scared of physical challenges.",
