  "input": "",
  "output": "In Plato's theory of forms, justice is the result of a rational order that is inherent in the soul and is inherited from the world of Forms. Plato believed that justice is an ideal that exists in the invisible realm of Forms, allowing it to be the same for all people in all societies. According to this theory, justice is only understandable when seen through the lens of a higher, truer reality that is ideal and perfect. As such, justice is something that is built into the very nature of the soul and is aligned with the highest of truths.",
