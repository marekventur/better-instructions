  "output": "Here are some creative ways to distribute invitations for a birthday party:\n- Include a unique code or hidden message on the back of the invitation that can be deciphered to confirm attendance. \n- Create an online version of the invitation and send it as an e-card with an embedded coding system that indicates when and who opened it. \n- Have a large banner with the party details printed and hang outside the party venue.\n- Send small gifts with the invitation such as stickers, bookmarks, and other items. \n- Have a scavenger hunt where the invitation is hidden around the neighborhood and those who find it can attend the party. \n- Make a video invitation using pre-recorded messages, then post it on social media and send it as a text message to guests. \n- Create an interactive website where guests can RSVP and leave comments or photos.",
