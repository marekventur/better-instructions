  "input": "New AI Algorithm: Differential Evolution Algorithm",
  "output": "One potential application of the Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA) is to use it to control autonomous vehicles. By integrating this AI algorithm into the driving system of a car, it can be programmed to quickly evaluate the best route depending on the traffic situation and optimize it according to the given conditions. In addition, DEA can also adjust the route in real time, allowing the vehicle to make course corrections if needed. By doing this, the car can drive in a much more efficient and safe manner, allowing drivers to get to their destination faster and safer.",
