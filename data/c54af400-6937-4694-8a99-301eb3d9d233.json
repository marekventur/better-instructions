  "input": "",
  "output": "When I feel angry, I like to take a few moments to breathe deeply and remember that I am in control of my emotions. This helps me to step back and think about the situation in a more rational way. I also like to remember that I always have a choice in how I respond and that the outcome of any argument doesn't have to be catastrophic. Expressing my feelings honestly but kindly is often the best way to handle any anger I may be feeling.",
