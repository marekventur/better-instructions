  "output": "The best place to view a sunset in India is the Jaisalmer Fort, located in the western state of Rajasthan. The fort, built in 1156, is perched on a hill and offers a stunning view of the sky as the sun sets at the horizon. In addition to the spectacular view of the sunset, visitors of the fort can witness the majestic backdrop of the Thar desert and its sand dunes, as well as the sight of different birds flying high in the sky. For a truly magical experience, visitors can enjoy an evening spent in the bustling lanes of Jaisalmer Temple or by the banks of the beautiful Gadi Sagar Lake.",
