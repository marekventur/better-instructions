  "input": "",
  "output": "Poverty has a significant impact on education, as families living in poverty may not be able to afford educational materials or even transportation to school. This can lead to children from impoverished backgrounds receiving an inferior education, which can have a long-term negative effect on their future prospects. Secondly, poverty can strain the resources of educational institutions, which can result in overcrowding in classrooms and an overall reduction in educational quality.",
