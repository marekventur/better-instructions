  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce the amount of plastics entering the ocean is to reduce, reuse, and recycle. This can be done by decreasing the amount of plastic products and packaging used, reusing plastic items where possible, and recycling plastics when no other option is available. Additionally, individuals can make conscious decisions about the products they purchase and their sources of single-use plastics.",
