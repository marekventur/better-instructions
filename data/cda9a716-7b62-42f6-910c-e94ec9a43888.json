  "instruction": "Combining thinking and creativity, come up with at least three different solutions to the following problem.",
  "input": "You need to complete a project for work but you have very limited time.",
  "output": "There are three solutions that could be considered to solve the problem of completing a project with limited time.\n\nThe first solution is to carefully plan and prioritize time. By planning out the project in advance and understanding what tasks have the greatest priority and need to be completed first, the project can be finished more efficiently and quickly. This will help to ensure that time is not wasted on unimportant or irrelevant tasks.\n\nThe second solution is to delegate tasks. Depending on the type of project and the number of team members available, it might be feasible to delegate some of the tasks required to complete the project. This will reduce the burden on any one person, while also utilizing the skills of the entire team. \n\nThe third solution is to be more efficient and creative in how tasks are completed. For example, looking for shortcuts or new ways to utilize technology to quickly complete tasks, or thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to problems. Being creative and looking for new ways to approach the project can help to finish the project before the deadline.",
