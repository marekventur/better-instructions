  "input": "",
  "output": "The word \u201cdemocracy\u201d is derived from the Greek words \u201cdemos\u201d, meaning people, and \u201ckratia\u201d, meaning rule. It is thought to have first been used in ancient Athens to refer to their system of government, in which citizens would directly elect representatives to serve in the Assembly, the governing body of the city-state. Over time, the term was adopted and adapted to refer to other forms of government, in which citizens have the right to vote and participate in the decision-making process. Today, \u201cdemocracy\u201d is used to refer to a system of government that is based on the principle of majority rule.",
