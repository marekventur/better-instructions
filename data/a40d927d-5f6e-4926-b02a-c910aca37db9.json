  "instruction": "Explain how the Hippo signaling pathway regulates organ size.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The Hippo signaling pathway is a conserved molecular mechanism used to regulate organ size in animals. It is composed of a kinase cascade that triggers a transcription regulatory cascade. Once activated, the Hippo cascade will modulate the activity of key transcription factors, such as Yap and Taz, ultimately leading to the downregulation of genes involved in organ growth and cell proliferation. This ultimately results in organ size regulation.",
