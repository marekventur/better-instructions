  "input": "",
  "output": "To scale a 1000-word article, begin by reading the article and breaking it down into its main points. Then think about ways to reformulate these points in order to reduce the overall word count. Try deleting or condensing any redundant or irrelevant information. You can also use rephrasing to express the same idea in sentence or phrase format. Finally, remove any superfluous language and review the article to make sure it still conveys the same message in fewer words.",
