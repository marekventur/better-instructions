  "output": "I was walking in the park when I saw a large beaver standing on its hind legs. It must have been three feet tall, I thought to myself in surprise. As I watched, the beaver moved its body to the side, grabbing a nearby stick in its mouth and walking away with it. I was amazed by the creature's dexterity, and watched in awe as it disappeared into the wooded area.",
