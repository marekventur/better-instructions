  "input": "",
  "output": "My favorite sights in Rome would be the Colosseum, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Saint Peter's Basilica and the Roman Forum. I would also love to visit the Borghese Gallery, with its wonderful art collection, and the Sistine Chapel, with Michelangelo\u2019s incredible frescoes. I would also enjoy walking along the Spanish Steps, as well as taking a trattoria-hop around the Trastevere neighborhood. Lastly, I would take the time to visit the catacombs outside the city walls, which are an incredible reminder of Rome\u2019s long history.",
