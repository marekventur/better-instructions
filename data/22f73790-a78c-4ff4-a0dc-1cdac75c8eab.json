  "input": "",
  "output": "Optical character recognition (OCR) is a technology used to convert scanned documents images into machine readable text. This is done by analyzing the documents for patterns and shapes to match against a standard set of fonts. It then matches the patterns with characters from the font, allowing it to make a character recognition decision on each character in the document.",
