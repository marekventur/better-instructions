  "input": "",
  "output": "Color and shape are two of the most important elements of product design. Color can be used to convey a certain mood, message or emotion to consumers, while shape is used to draw attention to certain features and cues. By including certain shapes and colors, designers can create a sense of harmony and cohesion, while they can also be used to create contrast or draw attention to particular elements. Additionally, color and shape can be used to trigger an emotional response or feeling in the viewer, influencing their perception of the product.",
