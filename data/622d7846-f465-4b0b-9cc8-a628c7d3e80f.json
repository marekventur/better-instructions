  "input": "",
  "output": "An AI model can be used to forecast sales by using various supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches. The model can use historical data to develop forecasting models, such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The model can also use data such as customer purchases, customer preferences, and customer behavior to develop more accurate predictions.",
