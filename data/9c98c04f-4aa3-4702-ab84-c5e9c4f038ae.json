  "instruction": "Assess the validity of the following statement: \"Computers are more efficient than humans for data entry tasks.\"",
  "input": "",
  "output": "This statement is valid, as computers are better suited to quickly and accurately enter large amounts of data. Computers are able to process and store data faster, with fewer errors, than humans. In addition, computers are better than humans for data entry tasks which require tedious and repetitive tasks. Humans are better suited for data entry tasks which require decision making, such as when dealing with incomplete or ambiguous data.",
