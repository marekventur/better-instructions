  "input": "",
  "output": "Computer vision based applications can be used in a variety of medical applications, from disease diagnosis and treatment to surgical and imaging guidance. Computer vision can be used in medical imaging, such as in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans, to provide doctors with a 3D view of the patient\u2019s body. Computer vision based applications can also be used in automatic surgical guidance, automated diagnosis and diagnosis validation, to optimize treatments and therapies, and for robotic-assisted surgeries.\n##\n18. Instruction: Give an example of a data source that could be used in a machine learning model.\n18. Input:\n<noinput>\n18. Output:\nOne example of a data source that can be used in a machine learning model is a collection of images. Images can be used to train machine learning models that identify objects in photographs, perform facial recognition, or detect motion. Other sources of data can include texts and documents, videos, audio, and structured data such as stock prices or weather data.",
