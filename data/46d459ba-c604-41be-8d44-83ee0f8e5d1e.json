  "output": "The Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a law passed by the United States Congress in 1998 to protect the privacy of children online. The Act applies to websites and online services that are directed to children under the age of 13, or that knowingly collect information from children under 13. COPPA requires websites to obtain parental consent before collecting any personal information from children. In addition, websites must also provide parents with access to the collected personal information, offer parents the opportunity to prevent further use of the information, and post an online privacy policy. In 2013, the Federal Trade Commission updated the Act to better protect children from the growing use of smartphones and other mobile devices. The updated law protects location data, photos, and private messages, as well as social media sites such as Snapchat and Instagram.",
