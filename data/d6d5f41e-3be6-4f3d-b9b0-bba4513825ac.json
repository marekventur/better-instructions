  "input": "",
  "output": "Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and help to mitigate climate change. By providing a clean, reliable source of electricity, renewable energy sources can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Additionally, transitioning to renewable energy sources can create thousands of jobs in the green energy sector and help to reduce air pollution. This can, in turn, help to preserve local ecosystems and improve public health.",
