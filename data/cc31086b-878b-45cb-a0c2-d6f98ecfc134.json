  "output": "Using Microsoft Word, you can easily create a resume that showcases your qualifications and stands out from the rest. Begin by having a header with your name, address, phone number, and email. Then include a summary section that gives an overview of your work experience, qualifications, and skills. After that, list each of your professional experiences in greater detail, starting with recent roles and listing chronologically backwards. Include details such as job title, company or organization, dates of employment, and a brief description of each position. Finally, include education and certifications, any awards or honors you have received, and any other information that is pertinent to the role you are applying for. Make sure to review the resume for accuracy, provide sufficient white space for readability, and choose an appropriate font.",
