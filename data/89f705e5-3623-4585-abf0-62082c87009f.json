  "input": "",
  "output": "I would create a database table to store customer information such as name, address, phone number, email address, and other relevant data. The table would contain columns for each of these data points as well as an identification field as the primary key to connect other tables with the customer data table. Additional fields would also be included to track the customer's purchase history, current orders, and account status. The table would be designed to securely store and protect customer data, while allowing ease of access to the data when needed.",
