I organized the agenda, assigned responsibilities, and provided a clear vision and direction. I also worked with everyone to ensure the project was successful and that everyone had tasks and roles that built on their natural strengths. This leadership experience helped me understand how to bring out the best in others and effectively accomplish our goals.",
