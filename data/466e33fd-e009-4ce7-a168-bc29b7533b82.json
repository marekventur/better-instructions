  "input": "",
  "output": "Technology has had a profound effect on work/life balance. With the advent of the internet and mobile devices, workers are increasingly able to work remotely and have greater access to their jobs and colleagues outside of traditional office hours. This has the potential to greatly increase the amount of time and energy that individuals are able to dedicate to their job, making it more difficult to properly unplug and relax. Moreover, the instant availability of information and resources can make it difficult to completely escape from work obligations. While technological advancements can have many positive benefits, it is important to be mindful of the impact it can have on work/life balance.",
