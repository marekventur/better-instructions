  "output": "Alex had been out of a job for months, searching desperately for something stable and dependable. But the market was tough and jobs were hard to come by. He did his best to update his resume, but no matter how hard he tried, the responses were all the same: \"We're sorry, but we already filled the position.\" He felt defeated, until one day he heard about a job opening at a local tech company. It was exactly what he was looking for and the pay was good.\n\nSo he put on his best suit and went for the interview. He was shaking as he walked into the boardroom and greeted the panel of executives. But somehow he managed to relax and be confident, and he made a good impression. He answered their questions with ease and before he knew it, he was hired. He was relieved and excited to have a job, and he couldn't wait to start.",
