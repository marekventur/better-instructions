  "output": "A perceptron is a type of artificial neural network. It consists of an input layer, an output layer, and multiple hidden layers of neurons. It takes the inputs, weights them, sums the weighted values, and applies an activation function to the final result to get the output. The weights of the neurons are adjusted during training in order to increase the accuracy of the results. Additionally, perceptrons are able to process non-linear data, which make them well-suited for complex tasks.",
