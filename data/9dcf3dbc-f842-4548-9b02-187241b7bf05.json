  "output": "A hash function is a mathematical function that maps data of any size to a fixed size output. It is used to ensure the security of data by providing a unique signature or digest of the data. A hash function takes an input string and produces an output of a fixed length, typically referred to as a hash or hash value. The output value should be difficult to guess based on the input.",
