  "input": "",
  "output": "I recently visited the Fun Land amusement park and it was anything but fun. The rides were constantly breaking down and the lines were so long we spent hours waiting. The staff were unhelpful and apathetic; they seemed to have no interest in the customers. The food was overpriced and nothing special. It was just a complete waste of time and money. There are much better amusement parks out there, and I wouldn't waste my time or money on this one.",
