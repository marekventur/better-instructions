  "input": "",
  "output": "Creditworthiness is an evaluation of an individual's or business' ability to pay back a loan. To gain creditworthiness, one must possess a good credit history, show proof of income, and demonstrate financial stability. A lender will look at the applicant\u2019s credit score, credit history, and current financial situation to determine eligibility. The applicant must also prove they have a steady source of income, can keep up with debt payments, and can repay the desired loan amount. \n\nIn order to gain creditworthiness, the applicant must usually provide documents such as payment histories, tax returns, income statements, and bank statements. The lender will look these documents over and provide an assessment of the applicant's risk.",
