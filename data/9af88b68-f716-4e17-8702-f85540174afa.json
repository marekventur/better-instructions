  "input": "",
  "output": "Decision trees are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for classification tasks. Unlike other machine learning algorithms, decision trees have the added advantage of being able to visualize the decisions made by the model. This makes them easy to interpret and explain, which can be valuable for making predictions in business and other contexts. Additionally, decision trees are not prone to the same kinds of bias or overfitting issues that other algorithms may be susceptible to, such as neural networks or support vector machines. However, decision trees can be slightly less accurate than some other models, so they may not always be the right choice for a given task.",
