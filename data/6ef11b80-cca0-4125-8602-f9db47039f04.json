  "output": "John and his sister Sally had been looking forward to the family vacation for months. It had been a long time since their entire family had gone on vacation together, and they were both excited for the memories they would make. \n\nThe destination was an exotic island that neither of them had ever visited before. They had a blast exploring the island, and they made a lot of fun memories. They went snorkeling in the sparkling blue waters, visiting ancient ruins, and exploring the local cuisine. \n\nOn the last day of their vacation, John and Sally decided to take a hike through the jungle. They ended up finding a hidden waterfall and enjoyed a wonderful swim in the fresh, cool water.\n\nAfterwards, as they started to make their way back home, they both knew that this was the best family vacation that either of them had ever had.",
