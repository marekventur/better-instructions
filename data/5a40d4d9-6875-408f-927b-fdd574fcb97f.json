  "input": "",
  "output": "The two main types of supervised learning algorithms are classification and regression algorithms. Classification algorithms are used to predict a discrete outcome from a given input, such as predicting someone's gender from their age and height. Regression algorithms are used to predict a continuous outcome from a given input, such as predicting someone's salary from their education and experience.",
