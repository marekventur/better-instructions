  "input": "",
  "output": "The main function of a refrigerator is to keep food and beverages cold and fresh by maintaining a temperature below the ambient temperature. It does this using a refrigeration cycle powered by a motor compressor. The compressor draws in refrigerant vapor and compresses it, which raises the temperature and pressure. This hot vapor is then sent to a condenser, where it is cooled by a fan and turned into a liquid, before being sent to an evaporator to cool back down.",
