  "output": "Both elephants and cows are part of the mammal family. Elephants are much larger animals with thick gray skin, and a long trunk that is highly specialized for grasping and smelling. Cows are smaller, with brown and white mottled fur and a pronounced muzzle for grazing. Elephants are social animals that live in herds, while cows are primarily herd animals. Elephants feed on leaves and bark, while cows mostly eat grasses and plants.",
