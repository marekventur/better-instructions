  "input": "",
  "output": "The purpose of multi-label classification is to predict multiple labels associated with a given instance of data. This is useful in applications such as text categorization, object recognition, and medical diagnosis where multiple labels can be assigned to a given data point. Multi-label classification algorithms are used to accurately and efficiently label instances of data with multiple labels that may have ambiguous boundaries such as in text categorization.",
