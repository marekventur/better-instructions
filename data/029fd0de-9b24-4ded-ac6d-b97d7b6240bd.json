  "output": "Martin was a young man who had always been a bit timid and shy, but it was his intense fear of spiders which really held him back. He would avoid going into places, stay home from work and school, and wake up at night to obsess over the possibility of a spider nearby. He knew he had to find a way to overcome his fear, so he decided to put himself through a rigorous program of exposure therapy. First, he started by looking at pictures of spiders, then reading about them and eventually even having them in his presence. He was terrified, but through self-determination he continued to challenge himself until he faced his fears head on and was able to live a normal life again.",
