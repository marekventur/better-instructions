  "instruction": "Diagnose the issue with this computer: It turns on but won't display anything onscreen.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "This issue may be due to several different factors such as a faulty monitor, a problem with the computer's graphics card, or a broken connection between the monitor and the computer. The first step is to make sure the monitor is working properly by hooking it up to another computer. If the monitor works, then the issue may be due to the graphics card or connection. To check the graphics card, try booting into Safe Mode and see if the computer displays anything on the monitor. If the monitor still doesn't display anything, you may need to replace the connection between the monitor and the computer. An IT professional may need to be consulted in this situation.",
