  "output": "Hi, everyone! \n\nSo, recently I became a parent, and let me tell you, it's a wild ride. Being a parent is like...\n\nBeing on a rollercoaster that never stops. You may get off for a bit, but you know it's always going to start moving again.\n\nBut it's not just the never-ending loops of parenting that can get you. It's the nagging. That's the worst part. You know, when the kids think they can get away with things, that's when the nagging starts. \n\nSo I've learned that sometimes you have to make a deal. You know, if they clean their room, they get a cookie. Or if they finish their homework, they get to watch an extra show. That kind of thing. It's a delicate balance, but it's my way of surviving parenthood. \n\nBut it's all worth it in the end. That's what I keep telling myself, anyway.\n\nThank you, folks!",
