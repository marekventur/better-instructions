  "output": "The main argument of The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger is that one must be mindful of the consequences of one's decisions and actions and learn to accept themselves for who they are, no matter how flawed they may be. The novel is narrated by the main character, Holden Caulfield, a rebellious teenager who tries to find his place in the world while dealing with feelings of anxiety, depression, and alienation. Holden searches for an idealized version of innocence that he believes can be found in childhood and lost in adulthood. He is ultimately faced with the reality that innocence and purity are fleeting and his struggles are an inevitable part of growing up.",
