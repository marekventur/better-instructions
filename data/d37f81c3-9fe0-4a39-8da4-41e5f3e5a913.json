Its distant marble towers reached high into the azure sky, casting a gentle glow on the surrounding lands. The Elven people lived in close harmony with nature, taking from the land no more than what it could bear. Songs and stories of the fabled kingdom filled the air, and its beauty and peace was sought by many throughout the realms.",
