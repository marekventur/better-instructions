  "output": "The basic components of an operating system include the kernel, the device drivers, the file system, the memory management system, the task scheduler, and the user interface. The kernel is responsible for managing system memory, scheduling tasks, and connecting application programs to hardware devices. Device drivers allow various hardware components to communicate with the operating system. The file system organizes data, while the memory management system allocates memory to programs. The task scheduler ensures that multiple tasks are executed in the proper order, and the user interface allows users to interact with the computer.",
