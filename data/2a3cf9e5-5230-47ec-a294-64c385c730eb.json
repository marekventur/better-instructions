  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between fascism and authoritarianism is the level of control each form of government seeks to have. Fascism seeks total control, with a culture based on reverence for the state, whereas authoritarianism strives to control the government and its activities, without necessarily attempting to control society. Fascism also tends to involve militarism and aggressive nationalism, whereas authoritarianism emphasizes stability and law and order.",
