  "output": "The Internet of Things (IoT) can provide people with better ways to manage their energy consumption. For example, it can enable people to connect their home\u2019s electrical appliances to the internet, allowing them to remotely control and monitor their energy usage and adjust their settings accordingly. IoT could also enable people to set schedules for the operation of electrical appliances, so that they can control the amount of energy used. It can also be used to monitor energy consumption in real-time, sending notifications when power consumption exceeds a certain threshold, helping people to reduce electricity costs.",
