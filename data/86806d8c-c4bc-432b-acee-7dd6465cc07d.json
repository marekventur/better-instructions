  "input": "",
  "output": "For this task, we need to build a machine learning model that can predict customer churn. The model should be able to take in customer data, such as demographic information, spending habits, and product usage, to predict whether a customer will remain loyal or not. We should also use an appropriate algorithm, such as a decision tree, to optimize the model's prediction accuracy.",
