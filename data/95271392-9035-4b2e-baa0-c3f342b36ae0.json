  "input": "",
  "output": "Neural networks have been increasingly used for computer vision tasks. The main benefit of using a neural network for this task is that it can take an input image and automatically recognize patterns based on the learned parameters. This allows it to accurately classify the image into its respective categories. Additionally, a neural network allows for scalability and can easily adapt to varying inputs. It is also more efficient compared to other approaches. Furthermore, neural networks are able to generalize well and perform well on unseen data, which is important for real-world applications.",
