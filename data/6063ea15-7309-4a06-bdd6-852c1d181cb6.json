  "input": "",
  "output": "Three challenges posed by autonomous vehicles include: technical challenges such as cost, reliability, and safety; ethical and humanistic challenges such as determining the ethical behavior of self-driving cars in certain situations; and regulatory and legal challenges such as accountability in the event of a crash and the difficulty of establishing appropriate standards. Additionally, the development of autonomous vehicles has raised serious privacy concerns as they collect vast amounts of data which can be used to track users' activity and location. These challenges need to be addressed in order for autonomous vehicles to be seen as viable alternatives to manually-driven cars.",
