  "input": "",
  "output": "Reinforcement learning has been used in a variety of real-world applications, such as robotics, healthcare, and finance. For instance, robotics applications use reinforcement learning for end-to-end control, where an agent (i.e. a robot) learns to maximize a reward by taking an action in an environment. In healthcare, reinforcement learning can be used to develop treatments and optimize health systems. In finance, reinforcement learning has been used to develop strategies for stock trading and portfolio management.",
