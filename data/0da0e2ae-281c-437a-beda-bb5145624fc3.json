  "output": "Pablo Picasso and Jackson Pollock are both renowned artists from the 20th century. Picasso was a Spanish painter and sculptor famous for his expressive and often cubist-inspired works of art, while Pollock was an American Abstract Expressionist, who was renown for his drip painting technique. Both painters were very influential and their styles are often contrasted with their use of color, texture, and symbolism. Picasso was more representative with his use of bold colors and figures, while Pollock used a more abstract and chaotic approach characterized by strokes and swirls of paint.",
