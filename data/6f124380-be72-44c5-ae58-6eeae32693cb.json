  "input": "",
  "output": "At sunset, the sun appears red because its light is passing through more atmosphere than during the day. This causes the blue and green wavelengths of light to be scattered in different directions, while the red and orange wavelengths are able to pass through the atmosphere, giving the sun a red hue.",
