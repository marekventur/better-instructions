  "input": "",
  "output": "The most widely used forms of renewable energy are solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass energy. Solar energy is harnessed from the sun\u2019s rays and converted into electricity, while wind energy is the kinetic energy generated by wind. Hydroelectric energy is drawn from water sources such as dams and rivers. Geothermal energy is heat energy generated by the Earth and harnessed through steam. Lastly, biomass energy is energy gained from organic sources such as plants and animals.",
