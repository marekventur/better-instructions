  "input": "",
  "output": "Vector graphics are composed of lines and shapes and are resolution independent, meaning the image does not lose quality when scaled up or down. Raster graphics are composed of pixels and are resolution dependent, meaning the image will lose quality when scaled up or down. Vector graphics are best suited for flat, abstract images while Raster graphics are better suited for complex, detailed images.",
