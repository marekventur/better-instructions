  "output": "John stumbled along the deserted path, lost in thought. It had been a while since he had ventured out into the wilderness and he had already gotten himself lost. As he continued walking, a small clearing appeared in the forest and he stopped, taking in the stunning beauty of the moment. As he stood int he sun, he began to relax and enjoy being alone in the wilderness. He took a few steps further and stumbled upon a secret lake, hidden deep in the forest. He took a moment to reflect as he gazed over the lake, and he realized that although he had lost his way, he had found something new and wonderful.",
