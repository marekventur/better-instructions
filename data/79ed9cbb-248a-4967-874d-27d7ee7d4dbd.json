  "output": "The name \u2018Africa\u2019 has its roots in the Latin language. The name has its origins in the Latin word \u2018Aphrike\u2019 which translates to \u2018without cold\u2019 or \u2018warm climate\u2019. The name was likely derived from the Phoenician word \u02bfafar meaning \u2018dust\u2019. The name was then used by the Romans to refer to the \u2018sunny\u2019 continent and it has become the commonly used name for the continent of Africa.",
