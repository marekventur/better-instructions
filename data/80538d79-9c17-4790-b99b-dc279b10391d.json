  "output": "A heap sort algorithm is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses a data structure known as a heap to take an unsorted array and sort it in-place. A heap is a data structure that allows for efficient operations such as insert, delete, and sorting. In a heap sort algorithm, the root element of the heap is compared with its children and swapped with the larger of its two children until the order of the elements has been established. Then, the next-smallest element is removed from the root and the heap remains valid. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.",
