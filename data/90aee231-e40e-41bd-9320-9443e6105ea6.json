  "output": "Social media has had a major impact on society, both positively and negatively. On the positive side, it has enabled people to easily connect and share information with others. It has also been an invaluable tool in sharing news and perspectives across the globe. On the negative side, it has been linked to a decrease in attention spans, as well as an increase in mental health issues as it leads to higher levels of comparison, loneliness, and cyberbullying. Additionally, it has been used to spread misinformation and alternative facts, leading to a greater level of mistrust and discord.",
