  "output": "One method to improve decisions about time management for teams is to set expectations for each team member. This can be done by creating and using a timeline for each task the team is responsible for. This timeline should indicate each step of the task, who is responsible for that step, and deadline for completion. This will give team members a better understanding of what is due and when it needs to be done. Additionally, assigning tasks to specific members will also improve coordination and accountability.",
