  "input": "",
  "output": "Preferential attachment is a phenomenon that occurs when nodes in a network have a tendency to link to those that are well-connected. This means that the more connections a node has, the more likely it is that other nodes will link to it. This phenomenon is often observed in networks that grow organically, such as social networks and citation networks. Preferential attachment plays an important role in the evolution of networks and can lead to the emergence of power laws and scale-free networks.",
