  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Greedy Algorithm: A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic strategy where the optimal solution is chosen at each step in order to maximize an objective function. \n\n2. Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is an iterative algorithm which seeks to find a minimum by following the steepest descent from a given point.\n\n3. Simulated Annealing: Simulated annealing is a metaheuristic algorithm to find an approximate global optimum for a given objective function. \n\n4. Genetic Algorithm: A genetic algorithm uses evolutionary concepts such as mutation, selection, and crossover to sample solutions in search for a global optimum. \n\n5. Branch and Bound: Branch and bound is an algorithmic technique which consists of dividing the problem into subproblems and bounding the solution space to guarantee an optimal solution.",
