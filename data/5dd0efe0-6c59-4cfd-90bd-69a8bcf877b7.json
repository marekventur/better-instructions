One day, the company's AI-driven facial recognition system misidentifies their eldest daughter and flags her as a criminal. Although she is eventually released and the mistake is corrected, the family is left shaken by the experience. The story demonstrates the importance of data privacy and the need for technology to be held accountable for the accuracy of its decisions, as it can have life-altering implications on those affected.",
