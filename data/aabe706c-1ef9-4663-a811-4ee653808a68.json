  "output": "Plastic waste is a global environmental issue that affects the land, air, and water. Plastics contain hazardous chemicals and materials that can be released into the environment. Plastic pollution harms land wildlife, seabirds, and marine mammals, and poisons aquatic life. Plastic waste can also block waterways, inhibit photosynthesis in plants, and accumulate in the food chain, leading to human health disorders. Furthermore, plastic waste has been linked to climate change as it releases methane and carbon dioxide from plastic decomposition, further contributing to global warming.",
