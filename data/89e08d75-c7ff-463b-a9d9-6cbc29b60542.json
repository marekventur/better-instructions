  "output": "\"Mending Wall\" by Robert Frost is a poem about two neighbors who mend a wall that serves as an emotional and physical boundary between them. The poem explores the idea of limitations, how these limitations can be both necessary and artificial, and what it means to be connected to one another despite our differences. Frost uses imagery, figurative language, and ironic juxtaposition to explore the relationship between the speaker and his neighbor and to convey themes of connection and limitation.",
