  "output": "The flow of oxygen in the human body begins with breathing. Oxygen is taken in through the lungs and enters the bloodstream. From the bloodstream, oxygen is transported to the cells throughout the body. \n\nOnce inside the cells, the oxygen combines with other molecules to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy source for all cell activity. The ATP is then used to power metabolic and physiological processes in the body. The oxygen that was used to make ATP is then released back into the bloodstream, and is eventually exhaled back out of the lungs.",
