  "instruction": "Explain why one should not use manufactured fertilizers.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Manufactured fertilizers should not be used because they contain high levels of potentially harmful chemicals that can pollute land and water sources, disrupt soil nutrition, and potentially be toxic to plants and animals. Furthermore, these fertilizers can be expensive and may not provide the desired results that natural fertilizers can provide. In addition, many manufactured fertilizers are composed of synthetic chemicals and may not break down naturally in the environment as natural fertilizers do.",
