  "output": "Yes, companies should strive to help curb climate change. Climate change is an environmental issue that affects all of humanity, and as such all of humanity should be part of the solution. Companies have a moral and ethical responsibility to help protect the environment and reduce their carbon footprint. This is especially true for companies that have a direct impact on the environment, such as those that produce clothes or food items, who should be taking steps to limit their waste and energy use. Additionally, companies should not be profiting from activities that harm the environment. By striving to help curb climate change, companies can show their commitment to responsibility and sustainability.",
