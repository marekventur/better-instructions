  "instruction": "Give me an example of a group of non-human animals that are capable of learning social behaviors.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Crows are amongst the most intelligent non-human animals and are capable of displaying complex social behaviors such as forming alliances, recognizing individual faces, and solving problems cooperatively. Dolphins are also a very social species and can learn the social behaviors of their peers. Studies of chimpanzee troops show them to be capable of learning sophisticated social behavior and patterns of cooperation within their communities.\n\nOther examples include African Wildcats, who live in groups and learn to cooperate with each other, and African Grey Parrots, which are known to be capable of grasping social behaviors actually taught by humans. Even fish species such as guppies, stickleback, and mollies show signs of learning social behaviors. Finally, honeybees have been studied extensively due to their complex social behaviors. They are capable of forming their own unique language to communicate with each other, and can even pass on information through generations. Such capabilities have led to research into the applications of this knowledge in robotics.",
