  "input": "Logical Puzzle: Trains A & B are 120 km apart and start travelling towards each other. Train A is travelling at 54 km/h and train B is travelling at 42 km/h.",
  "output": "1. Calculate the speed of both trains. Train A is travelling at 54 km/h, while train B is travelling at 42 km/h.\n2. Calculate the time needed for trains A and B to meet. This is equal to (120km / (54+42)) = 1.5 hrs.\n3. Calculate the distance Train A has travelled when the trains meet. This is equal to (1.5 * 54) = 81 km.\n4. Calculate the distance Train B has travelled when the trains meet. This is equal to (1.5 * 42) = 63 km.",
