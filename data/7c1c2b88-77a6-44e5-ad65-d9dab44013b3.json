  "instruction": "How does the Supreme Court of the US work?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in the country and the final judicial authority on matters of federal law. Each year, the court typically hears around 120 appeals of lower court decisions, which it can affirm, reverse, or remand. The nine justices of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President and confirmed with the advice and consent of the Senate. The court's decisions are made by five or more justices in majority opinions. This gives the court the ability to review unconstitutional laws and ensures that the Constitution is upheld.",
