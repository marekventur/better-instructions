  "instruction": "Calculate the area of a trapezoid with vertex coordinates A(-2, 5), B(-7, 9), C(-1, 13), and D(-3, 10).",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The area of the trapezoid can be calculated using the formula A=0.5 * (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides) * (distance between the parallel sides). The lengths of the parallel sides are (5-9) and (13-10) and the distance between the parallel sides is (7-(-2)) = 9, so we get A = 0.5 * (4 + 3) * 9 = 40.5. Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is 40.5.",
