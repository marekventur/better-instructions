  "output": "Thermal equilibrium is a thermodynamic condition in which two objects in direct physical contact reach the same temperature. Once two objects are in thermal equilibrium, no heat transfer occurs between them, even if they are kept in physical contact. This occurs when the objects have been in contact with each other for a long enough period of time and no other energy transfer is occurring.",
