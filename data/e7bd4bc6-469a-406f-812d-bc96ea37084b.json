  "output": "Plants are able to convert the sun's energy into food through a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis involves taking in light energy from the sun and combining it with water and carbon dioxide to produce glucose, which is then used by the plant to make energy-rich molecules. This process also produces oxygen, which is released into the atmosphere. Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of the plant cells and involves the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy.",
