  "input": "",
  "output": "In computer programming, a variable is a piece of information that can change. The value of a variable can be modified throughout the course of a program, and the value may vary depending on the input given to the program. In contrast, a constant is a piece of information that remains the same throughout the course of a program. The value of a constant cannot be changed by the program, and must remain the same at all times. Constants are often used to represent fixed values, such as mathematical constants or physical constants.",
