  "output": "The Red-tailed hawk is an impressive bird with a wingspan of up to 4 feet. It has a distinct reddish-brown tail and a light brown back. Its wings are broad and rounded, and its head and neck are usually covered in mottled reddish-brown markings. This hawk is often seen soaring high in the sky where it is able to spot small animals from a great distance. It is also quite good at maneuvering quickly in the air and diving on its prey. When hunting, it relies on its excellent eyesight, allowing it to spot animals stalking on the ground below. Red-tailed hawks also eat insects, small reptiles, amphibians, and some fruits.",
