  "output": "The potential risks associated with developing a distributed network of autonomous robots include: \n1. Potential security breaches due to hacking attempts or malicious external actors. \n2. Unpredictable outcomes due to changing environmental conditions, leading to unforeseen accidents or scenarios. \n3. Challenges in maintenance and upkeep of the robots, which could lead to increased costs.\n4. Potential safety risks due to the robots not adhering to safety protocols or not having the capability to react to any potential hazards. \n5. Issues with scalability and performance due to the need to coordinate multiple robots at once.",
