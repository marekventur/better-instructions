  "instruction": "Write a comparison between two products.",
  "input": "Product A: 3.2GHz 8\u2011Core Intel Xeon W processor, 32GB RAM\nProduct B: 4.5GHz 6\u2011Core Intel i7 processor, 16GB RAM",
  "output": "Product A has a higher clock speed but fewer cores, while Product B has a lower peak frequency and more cores. Product A has double the RAM of Product B, which may result in better multitasking performance. However, Product B may be better suited to certain tasks that rely on multiple cores, or tasks that require frequent bursts of high performance.",
