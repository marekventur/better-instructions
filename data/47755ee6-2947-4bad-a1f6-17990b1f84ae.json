  "output": "Most modern televisions are able to display a range of colors, with 16.7 million colors being the maximum number of colors supported by the average television. This means that the television is able to distinguish between shades of colors with precision, allowing for a richer array of colors. Specifically, the colors available on a modern television span the spectrum from bright reds, oranges, yellows, and greens, to darker blues and purples, with a range of shades in the middle.",
