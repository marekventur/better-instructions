  "output": "Fiscal policy refers to the government's use of taxation and spending to influence economic performance. It can have both short-term and long-term economic effects. In the short-term, fiscal policy can be used to stabilize the economy by increasing or decreasing taxes and spending. This can stimulate economic activity and help to reduce unemployment. In the long-term, fiscal policy can be used to encourage economic growth and reduce income inequality by shifting resources from the wealthy to the less affluent.",
