  "input": "",
  "output": "Rainbows often symbolize hope, happiness, and peace in literature. Rainbows are associated with post-storm scenes, when the Sun appears on a cloudy day and the sky is full of bright and vibrant colors. These colors also evoke feelings of joy, rebirth and unity, often indicating a moment when characters have overcome a difficult obstacle and emerged victorious. Rainbows can also represent a connection between two places or two different worlds. In literature, the symbol of a rainbow can serve as a bridge between the mundane and the divine, between the real and the supernatural.",
