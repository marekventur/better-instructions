  "input": "",
  "output": "There are several ways that the government may improve access to education. One way is to provide financial aid to students who cannot afford tuition and living expenses. This could be done through grants, loans, and scholarships. The government could also provide free or discounted textbooks and materials to students, and encourage colleges and universities to waive fees or admissions criteria. Additionally, the government could invest in better technology in classrooms to enhance the educational experience for all students.",
