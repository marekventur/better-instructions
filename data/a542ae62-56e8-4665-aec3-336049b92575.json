  "input": "",
  "output": "The government should implement policies that focus on job creation and economic growth for low-income countries. Creating job opportunities for people living in extreme poverty can immediately provide them with a means of subsistence, helping them to move away from poverty and improve their lives. In addition, governments should provide access to vocational training, education, and health care, while providing incentives to encourage businesses to benefit the local communities where they are active. Governments should also prioritize agricultural policies, as access to good-quality land and resources can help low-income countries to produce their own food.",
