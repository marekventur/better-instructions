  "input": "",
  "output": "Romantic Poetry and Victorian Poetry are two types of poetry that are linked but have distinct differences. Romantic Poetry, written during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, focused on individual emotions, imaginative exploration, and a tone of spontaneity and freedom. Its emphasis placed on nature and the internal world of the individual, rather than societal constraints and outside pressures. Victorian Poetry, written during the Victorian Era, was steeped in a sense of morality and respectability. It primarily focused on topics such as religion, morality, and family-oriented themes, and was heavily stylized and metered. Additionally, it used longer and more complex sentences than traditional Romantic Poetry and often incorporated complex literary devices such as allegory. In sum, Romantic Poetry is characterized by its exploration of personal feelings and its rejection of societal rules and constraints, while Victorian Poetry is noted for its moral, structured, and metered tendencies.",
