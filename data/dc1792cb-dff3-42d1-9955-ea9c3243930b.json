  "input": "",
  "output": "Induction and deduction are two distinct forms of reasoning used in philosophy. Deduction involves reasoning from a set of facts to a conclusion. It begins with premises that are assumed to be true and rules that logically connect these premises to a conclusion. Induction, on the other hand, is a form of reasoning from a single observation to a general rule. It involves arriving at a conclusion based on observed patterns and probabilities. Both induction and deduction can be used to make valid and reliable arguments, but each has its own strengths and weaknesses.",
