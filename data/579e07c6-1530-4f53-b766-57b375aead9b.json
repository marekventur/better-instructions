  "output": "One example of a storyboard related to the theme of outer space could be a comical scene of a 10-year-old trying to launch a homemade rocket in her backyard. The scene could show her gathering materials for her rocket, with her parents shaking their heads in disbelief; showing her attempting to light the rocket and it blowing up in her face; and finally showing her parents helping her to rebuild the rocket, only for it to be a success the second time around.",
