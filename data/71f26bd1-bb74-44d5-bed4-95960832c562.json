  "output": "After weeks of thinking and planning, John finally made the decision that had been on his mind for weeks. He was going to quit his job and move to a new city to pursue a career he had been passionate about his entire life. He had been struggling with this decision for a long time and he knew it was going to be a difficult change. But he was determined to make it work and try something different. \n\nJohn packed up his life and took a long drive to the city that held so much potential and possibility. He was excited but nervous as he arrived and began to explore the new life he had decided to take on. It took some time to get settled in and get used to the new environment, but John was feeling more and more confident with each passing day that he had made the right decision. \n\nJohn looked back at the difficult decision he had made and knew that it was right. He was now following his dreams and was thankful for having the courage to take the bold step and make a life-changing decision. He would never forget the decision he had made or the journey he had taken to get to where he was. It was rewarding to look back and realize that it was all worth it.",
