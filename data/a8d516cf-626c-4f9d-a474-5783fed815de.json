The Empire State Building is perhaps the most well-known of the city's skyscrapers, towering 1,454 feet and offering incredible views of the city and beyond. The Statue of Liberty is also located in New York City, welcoming immigrants to the city and standing as a symbol of freedom and democracy. The Metropolitan Museum of Art houses a vast array of historic artifacts, antiquities, and priceless works of art, while the Guggenheim Museum showcases cutting-edge modern and contemporary art.
