  "input": "",
  "output": "Anime has its roots in the early 20th century, when Japanese anime pioneers such as Shimokawa Oten, Seitaro Kitayama, and Junichi Kouchi began to make short animated films that were later called \"anime\". In the 1950s, Osamu Tezuka released his famous manga series \"Astro Boy,\" which established the anime style that is familiar today. This style quickly spread to television, film, and other mediums, becoming increasingly popular and expanding its influence around the world. Today, Anime is an entire artistic culture with its own distinct style, themes, and genres.",
