  "input": "",
  "output": "Zero-based budgeting is a budgeting process which requires managers to justify all of their expenses and income. Rather than budgeting based on past performance or previous budget amounts, zero-based budgeting requires all expenses to be justified by the current need for them. This helps to ensure that resources and funds are being used wisely and in the best interests of the business. Additionally, zero-based budgeting helps managers to prioritize their spending. Since all expenses must be justified, managers are encouraged to ask and answer questions about each expense, such as \u201cDo we really need this?\u201d and \u201cAre there better ways that this money could be utilized?\". This helps to ensure that only the necessary expenses are allocated in the budget and allows for more efficient usage of funds.",
