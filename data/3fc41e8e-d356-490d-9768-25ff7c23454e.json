  "input": "",
  "output": "Mathematics is an essential tool for engineers. It is used to understand and analyze objects and systems, calculate loads and stresses, and model and simulate real-world scenarios. Mathematical principles are used to develop new products and optimize existing ones. Mathematical models can also be used to investigate phenomena that cannot be experienced in the real world, like interactions between groups of particles or aerodynamic forces on high-speed vehicles.",
