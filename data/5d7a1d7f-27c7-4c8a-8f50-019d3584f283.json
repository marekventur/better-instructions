  "input": "",
  "output": "True. Climate change is a pressing global issue that requires urgent action. Rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, extreme weather events, and changes in global species patterns are all signs of climate change. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels, farming, and deforestation are contributing to the increased levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, which is the main cause of climate change. It is increasingly important for us to take action to reduce our contribution to climate change.",
