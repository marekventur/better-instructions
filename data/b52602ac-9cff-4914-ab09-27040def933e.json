  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change is impacting the Arctic in multiple ways. The most notable impact is the rapid warming of the Arctic climate, leading to a decrease in sea ice and an increase in permafrost thawing. This melting exposes the Arctic Ocean to more heat and light, which disrupts ocean ecosystems and threatens the livelihoods of Arctic inhabitants who rely on healthy fish stocks. As the ice melts, it is also triggering a feedback loop, as the ice is reflective and helps to cool the climate. Its loss exposes more ocean and land, which are much better absorbers of the sun's heat, leading to a further rise in temperature.",
