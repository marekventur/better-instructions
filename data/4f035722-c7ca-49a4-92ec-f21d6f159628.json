  "input": "",
  "output": "World War I and World War II had both similar and distinct causes and consequences. \n\nSimilar causes of the two wars included growing nationalism, militarism, and imperialism, which all contributed to global tensions and rivalries between great powers. Additionally, both wars were caused in part by the system of alliances that existed among nations. \n\nThe consequences of both wars were also similar in that they led to an increase in the power of the influence of the United States and the Soviet Union and an emphasis on the importance of international organizations such as the League of Nations and the United Nations. Furthermore, both wars led to a greater degree of cooperation between nations in the form of economic and political institutions, international agreements, and mutual defense, and in both cases, the aftermath of the war saw a dramatic increase in human displacement.\n\nHowever, there were distinct differences in the effects of the two wars. World War I saw the end of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires, while World War II ended with the division of Germany into East and West. In addition, the advance of totalitarian regimes in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy in the aftermath of World War I gave rise to the political rivalry of the Cold War era, while the end of World War II saw a new era of international cooperation, as well as an effort to create a permanent peace.",
