  "output": "Begin by sitting comfortably and paying attention to your breath. Focus on the sensation of the air entering your nostrils and leaving your mouth. Count your inhalationbreaths from one to eight, then repeat. Do this entire process again, then focus on your entire body and release any tension that you may have. Finally, let your mind be still and peaceful, and when you're ready you may open your eyes.",
