  "instruction": "Summarize this poem while retaining much of the original phrasing.",
  "input": "A sharp word of scolding,\nAs I heard tonite.\nNo longer embracing,\nMental moves out of sight.\n\nPeace and understanding,\nFar away from here.\nLeft to battle aloud,\nFeeling so much fear.",
  "output": "I was scolded harshly, leaving me feeling alone and afraid. There was no peace or understanding, only the muffled sound of a distant battle. My thoughts run away from me, my embrace of the world fading in the night.",
