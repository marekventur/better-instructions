  "input": "",
  "output": "A PHP-MySQL based login system consists of creating a HTML form, creating MySQL database with table for user authentication, writing PHP script for database connection and authentication, and creating a PHP file for authentication. To create the HTML form, we need to include the necessary form fields, such as email and password; then we can create a MySQL database with table that stores the users' credentials. After that, we need to write a PHP script to connect to the database and retrieve the required user credentials. Finally, we need to create a PHP page for authentication. This page will take the form data and compare it with the data from the database, and if it matches, a successful login will be performed.",
