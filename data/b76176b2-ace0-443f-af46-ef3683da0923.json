  "instruction": "Tell me the ingredients for a great smoothie recipe.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A great smoothie recipe should include a base of either non-dairy milk such as almond or coconut milk, or even yogurt or kefir for protein. Then, you can add in a few frozen fruits such as strawberries, blueberries, or bananas for sweetness and texture. For a filling and healthy smoothie, try adding some rolled oats, chia seeds, flax seeds, or nut butter for healthy fats and protein. Add sweetener such as honey or maple syrup if need be, and finally, a handful of greens such as spinach or kale to make sure you are getting your daily dose of vitamins and minerals.",
