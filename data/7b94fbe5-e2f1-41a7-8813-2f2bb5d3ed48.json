  "output": "Climate change refers to the long-term shift in average weather patterns and the associated impacts on ecosystems, human societies, and other aspects of the environment. This shift is primarily caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and prevent heat from escaping. As a result, the global climate is becoming warmer and more unpredictable, causing a wide range of effects, including sea level rise, extreme weather events, and disruption of ecosystems.",
