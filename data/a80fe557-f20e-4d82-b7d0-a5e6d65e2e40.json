  "input": "It was a strange sight when they found him.",
  "output": "He was standing in the middle of a deserted street, alone, with his arms spread open as if he was waiting for someone or something to come after him. His clothes were tattered and his face was twisted in a grimace of confusion. It was obvious he had been there for a while, and it made the small group of onlookers uneasy. They had no idea who this strange man was, or what he was waiting for. But one thing was for sure: something strange was about to happen.",
