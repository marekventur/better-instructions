  "input": "",
  "output": "The use of chatbots for customer service offers a number of advantages. Chatbots are typically available 24/7, so customers can access help whenever they need it. Chatbots can also provide rapid response times, so customers do not have to wait too long for a resolution to their query. In addition, chatbots provide consistent service because they can handle customer questions in the same way every time. This eliminates the uncertainty of human-based customer service and increases customer satisfaction. Finally, chatbots are cost-effective since they do not require the investment of human labor.",
