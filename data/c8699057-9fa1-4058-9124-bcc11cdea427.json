  "output": "Friend 1: Have you heard about online classes?\nFriend 2: Yeah, I've heard a lot about them. What do you think about them? \nFriend 1: Well, it seems like there are pros and cons with online classes. On the one hand, it gives a lot of flexibility with timing and geography, so you don't have to worry about commuting or attendance. But on the other hand, you don't have the same level of interaction with the professor or other students. \nFriend 2: Yeah that's true. I've noticed that you don't get the same level of support as in a traditional classroom setting. But I think it's also important to note that there are a lot of resources available online that students can benefit from, such as video tutorials, chat rooms and discussion boards. \nFriend 1: That's definitely a plus. I think online classes should be taken in moderation, as there is no substitute for personal interaction when it comes to learning.",
