  "input": "",
  "output": "The sky appears blue because of an effect called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight interacts with the atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, such as red. This gives the sky its blue appearance.",
