  "instruction": "Explain why exponential curves tend to be used for modelling population growth.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Exponential curves are often used to model population growth because these curves can capture the concept of compounding. As population size increases, the additional population growth rate increases due to the availability of resources. This is captured in an exponential curve, which shows a steeper rate of growth as the population size increases. Additionally, the rate of growth can be adjusted in an exponential model to better fit a population's growth. This allows for more accurate predictions of population growth and how it will vary in the future.",
