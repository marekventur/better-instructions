  "output": "Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a statistical technique used to uncover relationships between words and documents. It can be used to determine the most relevant words for a document, to find similar documents, and for document summarization.\n\nTopic modelling is a technique used to find and extract the main topics from a collection of documents. It can be used to find relationships between documents and discover clusters of documents about similar topics.",
