  "input": "",
  "output": "This phrase means that rather than measure the passage of time by counting the number of days, invest time and effort into making each day meaningful. Put effort and time into making meaningful memories and accomplishing valuable goals, as opposed to merely ticking off days on a calendar. Focus on taking advantage of every moment and living life to its fullest.",
