  "output": "Enforcing a mask-wearing rule in public is essential to protect people from the spread of COVID-19. Wearing a mask is one of the best strategies to reduce the spread of the virus. It can reduce the risk of being infected and protect others by blocking droplet transmission. Mask-wearing reduces the transmission of aerosol particles and is a simple and effective way to limit the spread of the virus. Therefore, enforcing a mask-wearing rule in public is crucial to protect people and reduce the spread of the virus.",
