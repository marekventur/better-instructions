  "output": "Data preprocessing is an important step in machine learning. It involves a set of procedures to modify the data so that it is easier to work with, better suited for the intended machine learning algorithms, and more likely to lead to better learning outcomes. Preprocessing can include operations such as cleaning and normalization of data, reducing the number of features, scaling, converting data formats, and removing noise and outliers. Data preprocessing supports all stages of machine learning and is necessary for successful machine learning outcomes.",
