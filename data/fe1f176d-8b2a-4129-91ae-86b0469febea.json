  "input": "",
  "output": "Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models are among the most powerful tools for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have a large variety of potential applications. They are used in areas such as summarization, question generation, translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis, among others. GPT models can also be used in robotics to generate natural language commands to be understood by robots. In the healthcare industry, GPT models are used to detect and diagnose various diseases and provide personalized advice to patients. Furthermore, GPT models can be employed in the field of finance to create models that can predict stock prices and trends. Finally, GPT models are used in product and services recommendation systems, to generate marketing campaigns, and to answer customer service queries.",
