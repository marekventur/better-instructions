  "output": "Data loss prevention techniques can be divided into two broad categories: preventive and reactive. \n\nPreventive techniques include implementing strong authentication policies, encrypting data at rest and in transit, regular software updates, and using firewalls. These measures reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks by preventing access to sensitive information and minimizing any damage that may be caused by a cyber attack.\n\nReactive techniques are more focused on mitigating the effects of the cyber attack itself. They include regularly backing up data, utilizing real-time monitoring and threat detection systems, and responding quickly to security incidents. While these measures may not be able to prevent a data loss, they can help reduce the severity and minimize the damage caused.",
