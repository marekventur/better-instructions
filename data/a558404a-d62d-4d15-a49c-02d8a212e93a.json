  "input": "",
  "output": "Neural networks are powerful tools for machine learning because they can capture and leverage complex patterns in data. They are also flexible and can be adapted to new tasks with little effort. Neural networks are also robust to noise and can learn complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs. Furthermore, they are efficient in terms of processing time and memory, and can often reduce the number of parameters required to describe a dataset.",
