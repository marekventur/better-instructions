I know I haven't been the best friend lately with my outbursts and lack of understanding, and I regret not being able to communicate my feelings better. I know I have hurt you and I'm sorry.\n\nI also want you to know that I appreciate our friendship and all of the time we have spent together. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me for my actions, and that we can move past this and continue our friendship.\n\nSincerely, \n\nYour Friend",
