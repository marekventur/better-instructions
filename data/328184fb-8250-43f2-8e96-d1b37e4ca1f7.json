  "input": "",
  "output": "A system for robots to recognize and interact with humans can include sensors, facial recognition software, and natural language processing (NLP). Sensors help the robot to identify the presence of humans in its environment, while facial recognition software can be used to identify the unique characteristics of each person. NLP allows the robot to interpret the emotions and expressions of humans, and to understand and respond to spoken and written language. The robot can also use this system to recognize and interact with objects that humans interact with regularly.",
