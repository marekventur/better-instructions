  "instruction": "Explain the difference between acute stress and chronic stress.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Acute stress is an intense, short-term reaction to a stressful event. It is generally resolved once the threat passes or a person is able to successfully manage the event. Chronic stress, on the other hand, is a prolonged and constant strain that results from ongoing difficult life situations, such as poverty and homelessness, or daily annoyances like a high-pressure job. Chronic stress can accumulate over time and lead to physical and emotional exhaustion. It can also cause an array of physical and mental health problems if not managed in a healthy and timely manner.",
