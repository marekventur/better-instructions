  "output": "The Water Cycle is the continuous process by which water moves from the atmosphere, to land and then back to the atmosphere. The cycle is driven by evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Evaporation occurs when water evaporates from the surface of bodies of water, such as lakes and oceans. The water vapor then rises and condenses in the atmosphere, forming clouds. The clouds move and finally, when the conditions are right, the clouds release the water in the form of precipitation, such as rain or snow, which then returns to the earth's surface. The water then begins the cycle once again.",
