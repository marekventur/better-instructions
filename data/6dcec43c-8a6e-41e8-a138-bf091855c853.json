  "input": "",
  "output": "Plants are able to sense and respond to environmental signals, such as light, temperature, and moisture, in order to survive and thrive. Plants use photoreceptors to detect light, specialized cells to sense and respond to changes in temperature, and their root systems to detect moisture. Plants also respond to biotic stimuli, such as the presence of other organisms or predators. In response, plants may produce defensive chemicals or adopt defensive behaviors to protect themselves.",
