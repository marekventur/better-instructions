  "instruction": "Design a logo for a travel agency called \"Around the World\".",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The logo should feature a globe with the words \"Around the World\" written underneath it. The globe could be surrounded by subtle circles or swooshes in earth tones to represent the travels of clients and the sense of adventure that the travel agency provides. The font of the text should be modern and the colors should include blues and greens. There should also be a bright accent color to add a pop of vibrancy such as yellow or red.",
