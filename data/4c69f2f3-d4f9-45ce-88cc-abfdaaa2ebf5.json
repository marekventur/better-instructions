  "input": "",
  "output": "The 2021 wildfire season in California is expected to be active and bring about an early start to some areas as a result of recent drought conditions. This will likely cause more extensive damage than in previous years due to the dry conditions. Conditions this season will be further magnified by a potential increase in extreme weather events such as strong winds, dry lightning and low humidity, in addition to potential higher temperatures. Governments and officials across California have taken steps to prepare for fire season and are already implementing preventative measures such as prescribed burns and vegetation thinning. These efforts, alongside continued public education campaigns, increased firefighter presence and fire safety regulations, will likely mitigate some of the effects of an active fire season.",
