  "output": "The steps in designing a digital customer experience include: gathering customer feedback, understanding the customer journey, setting measurable goals, creating the customer experience, testing and refining the design, and launching the experience. Gathering customer feedback involves getting customer feedback on the existing user experience, including what works and what needs to be improved. Understanding the customer journey involves mapping out the customer's journey step-by-step, identifying key touchpoints, and articulating the desired outcomes. Setting measurable goals involves determining what KPIs should be used to measure customer satisfaction. Creating the experience involves designing a seamless user experience across all touchpoints and channels. Testing and refining the design involves performing user testing and continually iterating to improve the experience. Finally, launching the experience involves ensuring the customer experience is rolled out smoothly.",
