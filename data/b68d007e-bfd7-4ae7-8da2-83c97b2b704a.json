  "input": "",
  "output": "Intellectual property rights are a set of legal protections granted to creators and owners of original works of authorship, designs, discoveries, and inventions. By granting exclusive rights to rights holders, it helps to protect their original works and the time and money they expended in creating them. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. These rights help ensure that the creator or rights holder benefits from the works they create, and also encourages innovation and creativity.",
