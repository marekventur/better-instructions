  "input": "",
  "output": "The best way to approach a difficult problem is to break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. Identifying and analyzing the individual components of a problem can help to give a clear understanding of the problem and make it easier to find solutions. Additionally, brainstorming with others can help to generate new ideas and potential solutions. Additionally, looking for patterns or connections between the different components of a problem can also lead to solutions.",
