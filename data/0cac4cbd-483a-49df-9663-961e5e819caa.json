  "output": "The African Wild Dog, or Lycaon pictus, is a medium-sized mammal native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It is the only species in its genus and is the largest of the African canines. African Wild Dogs have a light brown coat with large, round ears and distinctive black and white markings. They are social creatures and live in packs of around 8-11 individuals. African Wild Dogs are highly territorial and will fiercely defend their range. They hunt by chasing their prey, mainly small antelopes, hares, and birds. Reaching speeds of up to 44 miles per hour, they are one of the fastest animals on earth. African Wild Dogs are an endangered species, with the total population estimated to be around 6,600 individuals.",
