  "instruction": "Describe how current politics could affect the economy of the United States",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Current political tensions both domestically and internationally could have a serious impact on the US economy. On a domestic level, the policies of the current presidential administration could lead to increased costs for business and labor, higher taxes and tariffs, and more regulation. On an international level, continued instability in the Middle East and Asia could lead to higher energy prices, further eroding consumer and business confidence. Additionally, trade disputes with economic powers such as China and Mexico could lead to retaliatory tariffs and disruption to global supply chains, creating further economic instability. All of these issues have the potential to stall economic growth and impose costs on the US economy.",
