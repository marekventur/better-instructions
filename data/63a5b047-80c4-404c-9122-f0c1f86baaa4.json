  "input": "",
  "output": "The effects of the pandemic on traditional retail and online retail have been markedly different. During the pandemic, many traditional retail stores have been closed or heavily restricted due to public health considerations. This has resulted in a dramatic drop in brick-and-mortar sales as consumers shifted to more online retailers for their shopping needs. On the other hand, online retailers have seen a surge in sales since the start of the pandemic as more consumers have embraced e-commerce as a viable option for everyday shopping. This shift in purchasing behavior has likely led to a permanent change in the way consumers do their shopping and has necessitated that traditional retail stores look towards differentiating themselves in order to remain competitive with online retailers.",
