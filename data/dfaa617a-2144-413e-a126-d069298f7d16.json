  "output": "Oil spills can have devastating effects on oceanic wildlife. Oil spills can damage the environment, disrupt habitats, and contaminate the food chain, leading to the death of marine wildlife. Oil spills can also block sunlight from entering the water, depleting oxygen levels and threatening the survival of aquatic organisms. Additionally, oil spills can contaminate drinking water, making it poisonous for any wildlife that consumes it.",
