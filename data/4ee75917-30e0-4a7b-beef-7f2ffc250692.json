  "input": "",
  "output": "The three main differences between a blockchain and a distributed ledger are: 1) a blockchain is a cryptographically secure distributed database, stored in multiple instances, while a distributed ledger is a cryptographically secure single database stored as a single record; 2) a blockchain is a type of distributed ledgers, but not all distributed ledgers are blockchains; 3) a blockchain uses a consensus mechanism that requires computer nodes to validate and agree on new blocks before they can be added to the blockchain, while a distributed ledger does not.",
