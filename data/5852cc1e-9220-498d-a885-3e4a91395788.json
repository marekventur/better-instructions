  "output": "The night had been going well enough. Daniel had made his way home from a night out with friends to his small apartment in the city center. However, as he turned the corner and made his way down the alley he saw something that sent a chill down his spine. It was a figure shrouded in darkness, standing completely still and looking directly at Daniel. He wanted to turn and run, but his feet felt like they were rooted to the spot. Suddenly, the silence was broken by a deep, raspy voice: \"I have been waiting for you this whole time\".\n\nDaniel tried to move, to scream, to do anything, but he was completely paralyzed with fear. He felt a power emanating from the figure, something almost supernatural, as it began to slowly move towards him. He was about to faint when, out of nowhere, a crackling of electricity filled the air, and the figure instantly vanished.\n\nDaniel slowly came to, the events of the night slowly registering in his mind. All he could do was utter a single word: \"Wh-who were you?\".",
