  "instruction": "Given an equation, solve it and explain the steps",
  "input": "3x + 4 = 2x + 12",
  "output": "The equation 3x + 4 = 2x + 12 can be solved by subtracting 2x from both sides to get 3x -2x = 12 - 4. Then, x = 8.\n\nSteps:\n1. Subtract 2x from both sides: 3x - 2x = 12 - 4 \n2. Simplify: x = 8 \n3. Answer: x = 8",
