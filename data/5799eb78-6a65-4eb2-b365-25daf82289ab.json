  "output": "John had just entered his senior year of high school with an ambitious plan. He was determined to use his remaining time to make a difference in the world. He quickly set his sights on a local cause, stopping the destruction of natural wetlands due to urban development. \nJohn conceived a plan to raise awareness and gain support, and then executed it with a passion. From hosting bake sales to writing letters to local politicians, John worked tirelessly to spread his message. In the end, his efforts had a major impact, and the wetlands were spared. Thanks to John, a difference was truly made.",
