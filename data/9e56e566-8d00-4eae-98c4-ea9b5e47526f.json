  "output": "Robert Frost\u2019s \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d is widely read and quoted today, but its meaning can be widely interpreted. Frost\u2019s poem describes a protagonist standing at a point of life\u2019s journey, with two roads to choose from. The protagonist decides to take the road less traveled by, rather than the one that has been trodden more often. He muses about his decision, considering the consequences of his actions. Through this metaphor, Frost encourages self-reflection and offers the idea that we should be brave and take paths that are less common. Ultimately, the poem is a commentary on the choices we make in life and the consequences of those decisions.",
