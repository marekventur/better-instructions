  "input": "Design style: Modern\nCompany Name: ACE",
  "output": "The logo should be modern and minimal. It should have a strong font that implies professionalism and trust. The colors should be primarily white, gray, and blue to portray a feeling of calm and dependability. The \"A\" and \"C\" of the company name, ACE, should be slightly larger than the \"E\", to emphasize the abbreviation. The overall shape should be a simple circle, to include a gentle and unified form.",
