  "output": "The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster occurred on January 28, 1986 when the Challenger space shuttle disintegrated 73 seconds after launch due to a booster rocket failure. All seven astronauts aboard the shuttle were killed in the accident. The disaster was caused by a hot-air seal in one of the solid rocket boosters rupturing, leading to a loss of lift and eventual disintegration of the shuttle mid-flight.",
