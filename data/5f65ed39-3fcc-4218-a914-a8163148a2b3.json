  "output": "It was a hot summer night at the carnival. The lights twinkled as the rides moved up and down, filling the area with an electric energy. Music blared from every stand and in the distance, the giant Ferris wheel glowed brightly. People laughed and screamed as they enjoyed the night, and the air was filled with the smell of cotton candy and popcorn. It was a wonderful night, and nobody wanted it to end.",
