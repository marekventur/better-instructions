  "input": "",
  "output": "The concept of the multiverse is a theory within theoretical physics that proposes the existence of parallel universes. According to this theory, each universe exists in its own bubble with distinct physical laws and conditions. This means that every quantum decision leads to a different consequence, resulting in an almost infinite amount of possible realities. In essence, the multiverse theory suggests that our Universe is one of many, making it an exciting and perpetually evolving concept.",
