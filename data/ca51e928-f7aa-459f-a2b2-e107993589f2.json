  "output": "Two paths both stretching before me,\nJourneying it seemed with no end.\nOne as uncharted and mysterious,\nThe other well-trodden, though harder to ascend.\n\nI stood in a quandary with future uncertain,\nUnspoken promises awaiting me.\nWeighing the risks and rewards of each\nA choice the path I'd have to see.\n\nSo I took the path less traveled by,\nVenturing onwards with a silence so bold.\nThough I can't speak of what might have been,\nThis path I'm on is the story I'll forever hold.",
