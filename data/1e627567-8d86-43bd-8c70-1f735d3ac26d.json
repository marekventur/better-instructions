  "output": "A neural network is a computational model made up of interconnected nodes that use weighted connections to process input and output data. Neural networks are inspired by the structure and organization of the human brain, and are used to process large amounts of data and recognize patterns. They can be used for a variety of tasks, from the identification of objects in images to the generation of text.",
