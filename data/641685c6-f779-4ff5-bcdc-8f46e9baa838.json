  "input": "",
  "output": "AI is a powerful tool for predicting customer behaviour because it is able to analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately. By processing customer interactions, transactions, and other data, AI can gain an understanding of customer preferences and habits. This understanding can then be used to deliver targeted and personalized experiences, making it easier for customers to find what they are looking for and in turn, increasing customer loyalty and engagement. AI is also able to detect patterns and trends quickly and accurately, making it possible to act proactively rather than reactively to customer behaviour. This can lead to better predictions of customer behaviour and, ultimately, improved customer experience.",
