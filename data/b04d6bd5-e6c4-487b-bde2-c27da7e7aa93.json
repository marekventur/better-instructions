  "input": "The article is about the potential effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy",
  "output": "The Covid-19 pandemic has had severe consequences on the global economy. An estimated 300 million jobs have been lost worldwide, and the International Monetary Fund expects global output to shrink by 4.9 percent this year. The disruption to global supply chains has caused further economic damage, while businesses have taken large financial losses due to the closure of stores and distance learning has virtually wiped out the physical education industry. Moreover, the pandemic has widened the gap in wealth between the rich and the poor. Although governments around the world have implemented economic stimulus packages, the road to economic recovery is still unpredictable.",
