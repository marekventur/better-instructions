  "output": "The perfect destination for a virtual family reunion is a virtual world. With the help of technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality and 3D simulations, family members can come together virtually and create a unique, interactive space to catch up and have fun together. A virtual world can also serve as an ideal space to engage in activities such as team trivia, virtual board games, virtual scavenger hunts and other fun activities that can help with connecting and reconnecting with family members.",
