  "input": "",
  "output": "The first time it was seen, it wasn't much more than a small blob in the mist of the forest. It blended in almost eerily well with its surroundings, its bright yellow and green stripes going almost completely unnoticed.\n\nLocals whispered of the creature, recounting the tale of an unidentifiable animal seen in the forest. Curiosity caused a small group of brave adventurers to come together to investigate the creature further.\n\nAs the adventurers cautiously approached, the creature revealed itself under the shining sun. It had a long, thin body, 6 furry legs, and wings as soft as silk. The creature's wings fluttered as it lifted itself from the ground and flew gracefully into the sky, leaving the adventurers dumbfounded. \n\nThe creature had been discovered, and the local legend was now true; the new creature that lived in the forest had become the talk of the town.",
