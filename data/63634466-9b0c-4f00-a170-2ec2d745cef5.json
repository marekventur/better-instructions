  "output": "Earth and Mars differ in many ways. Earth is much larger in size and mass than Mars, has a thicker atmosphere, and more abundant water. Earth is also much more hospitable for life due to its temperature and atmosphere. However, Mars has a unique atmosphere consisting of mostly carbon dioxide, which gives it a striking red color. Its atmosphere is also much thinner, and its surface is mostly made of iron oxides. Despite these differences, both planets share similar geological features such as volcanoes, canyons, and craters.",
