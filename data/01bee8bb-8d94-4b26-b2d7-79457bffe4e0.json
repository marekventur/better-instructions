  "instruction": "Describe how a tsunami is formed",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A tsunami is a series of powerful, long-wavelength ocean wave which is caused by a large underwater disturbance, such as an earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, or glacier calving. The energy generated by the disturbance displaces a large amount of ocean water, resulting in a wave which propagates outwards from its source with tremendous energy. Tsunamis can travel hundreds of miles, causing widespread destruction when it reaches land. In the deep ocean, tsunamis may only be a few inches high, but as the wave approaches shore, it builds in size, sometimes reaching heights over 100 feet. As the wave moves inland, it causes flooding, structural damage, and sometimes loss of life.",
