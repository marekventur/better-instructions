  "input": "",
  "output": "Communism and socialism are both economic systems which focus on the common ownership of resources, the distribution of wealth, and an egalitarian society. However, there are important differences between these two systems. \n\nCommunism is an ideology which advocates for the total abolishment of private property, with wealth and resources being owned and controlled by the state. Socialism, on the other hand, advocates for more moderate reforms in the economy, such as state-controlled production and taxation of the wealthy, but does not completely abolish all forms of private property.\n\nCommunism is thus a much more radical ideology, while socialism provides a more moderate alternative with many governments currently utilizing elements of it.",
