  "output": "I was once walking down a dark street in an unfamiliar neighborhood when a group of people began to follow me from behind. I was trembling in fear as I scaredly began to pick up the pace, with the group drawing closer and closer. After what seemed like hours of walking, the group abruptly stopped following me. I was overwhelmed with relief, although I was still shaking with fear at this point. After what had happened, I was so relieved to reach home unscathed, but it was a frightening experience I\u2019ll never forget.",
