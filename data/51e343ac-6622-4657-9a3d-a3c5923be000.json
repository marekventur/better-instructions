  "input": "",
  "output": "The two main types of facial recognition technologies are 2D and 3D. 2D facial recognition uses 2D images of a person to identify them and is typically used to identify someone in a photo or video. 3D facial recognition uses 3D scans of a person's face to create a detailed map of the face and is often used for security or identity verification. While both are accurate, 3D facial recognition is more secure and accurate since it creates a more detailed map of the person's face.",
