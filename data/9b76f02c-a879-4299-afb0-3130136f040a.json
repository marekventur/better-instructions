  "input": "",
  "output": "I would design the countertop to be made of a strong and durable material such as granite or quartz. The countertop should also have a slightly curved top surface to provide even weight distribution and stability. I would also reinforce the countertop with a wooden frame or metal brackets to ensure it can hold up to 25lbs safely.",
