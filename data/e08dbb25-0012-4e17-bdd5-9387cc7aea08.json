  "input": "",
  "output": "The Boston Tea Party was a protest against the British taxes on tea, which occurred in December 16, 1773. It was an iconic event that served as an important step towards the American Revolution. As part of the protest, around 60 colonists dressed as Native Americans boarded some British ships and threw more than 300 chests of tea overboard into Boston Harbor. This event is considered to be the first act of open defiance by the American colonists against British rule. The colonists were angered by the fact that the British had imposed a tax on tea, even though they were not represented in the British Parliament. It is estimated that the total value of the tea thrown into the harbor was about $10,000.",
