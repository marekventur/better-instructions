  "output": "One solution to the issue of overcrowding prisons in the US is to focus on providing rehabilitative services for inmates rather than incarceration. This could include providing job training and psychological services to help inmates reintegrate into society and reduce the likelihood of them committing further crimes. Additionally, investing in crime prevention measures such as improved education and community initiatives could help to reduce the overall crime rate.",
