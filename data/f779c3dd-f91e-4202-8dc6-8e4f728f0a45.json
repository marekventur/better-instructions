  "output": "Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. These techniques involve taking genes from one organism and inserting them into another organism in order to give it new traits. GMOs are commonly used for food production, medical research, and other applications, but carry some risks, including potential changes to the environment, the emergence of new allergens, and unknown long-term impacts on human health. Despite these risks, GMOs are not always labeled or easily identifiable, leading to concern among some consumers.",
