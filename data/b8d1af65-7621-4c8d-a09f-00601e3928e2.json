  "output": "The impact of climate change on businesses is significant, as businesses are exposed to many of the risks associated with a changing climate. These risks can range from extreme weather events that could cause physical damage to the property of a business or lead to business disruption and economic losses, to changes in supply and demand resulting from shifts in market conditions related to weather patterns and climate variability. In addition, businesses may need to incur additional costs in order to adapt to the changing environment, such as changing production methods or investing in new resources. In all, climate change presents a wide range of challenges for businesses to manage and mitigate.",
