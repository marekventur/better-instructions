  "input": "",
  "output": "The Higgs Boson particle, sometimes referred to as the \"God particle\", is an elementary particle that is thought to explain the source of all mass in the universe. This particle was discovered at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012 and is a key component of the Standard Model of particle physics, which explains the fundamental forces of nature. The significance of the Higgs Boson particle is that it explains why some particles have mass while others do not and also suggests the existence of other particles or forces that are yet to be discovered.",
