  "input": "",
  "output": "A security risk that could occur in an online system is the risk of data theft or compromise. This could come in the form of hackers breaching the system by exploiting weaknesses in the security protocols, leading to the theft and unauthorised use of confidential information, or data being obtained through malicious software like malware or spyware. Additionally, unencrypted data that is stored on servers can be exposed to unintentional disclosure which could lead to serious damage if the data that was leaked is sensitive.",
