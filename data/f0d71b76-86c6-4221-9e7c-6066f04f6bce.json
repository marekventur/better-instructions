  "input": "",
  "output": "Step 1: Start the debugger and set a breakpoint on the line containing the function.\nStep 2: Step through the program and watch the value of x as it changes.\nStep 3: Notice that the value of x^2 increases as x increases.\nStep 4: Notice that 3 is added to the output of the function, no matter what value x is.\nStep 5: The function can now be expressed as: f(x)=x^2+3.",
