  "input": "",
  "output": "When a decision affects multiple people, it might be better to compromise instead of argue. For example, if you and your friend are both going out to eat, and you want pizza but they want sushi, a compromise could be to find a place that serves both or to take turns getting what each person wants. Compromising can help to avoid arguments and to arrive at a satisfactory solution that both parties can agree to.",
