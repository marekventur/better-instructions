  "input": "",
  "output": "Discrimination exists in the workplace for various reasons. In some cases, it is a direct result of prejudice or bias where people hold beliefs about certain groups of people that lead to discriminatory actions. Discrimination can also be an indirect result of structural and institutional barriers that lead to unequal access to resources or opportunities, such as educational opportunities, or to discriminatory hiring or promotion practices. Additionally, discrimination can be the result of a combination of individual and institutional biases. Regardless of the cause, discrimination creates a hostile work environment and can lead to unequal access to resources and opportunities.",
