  "input": "",
  "output": "In the United States, internet censorship laws are relatively lax compared to other countries. The country mainly censors content related to child exploitation, obscenity, and copyright infringement. Decisions to restrict access to particular websites are usually made by individual internet service providers, rather than by the government, so there is not one single policy that applies to the entire country. There are also certain exemptions, such as when content is being used for educational or journalistic purposes.",
