The birds are singing and the leaves of the trees are rustling in the breeze. Everywhere is alive with the sound of laughter and the smell of freshly cut grass as people enjoy the day. On a summer afternoon, it's the perfect time to spend with family and friends and make memories that will last a lifetime.",
