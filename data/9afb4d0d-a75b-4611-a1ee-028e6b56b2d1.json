  "input": "",
  "output": "The biggest potential downside to renting a property is that the renter may not have control over the upkeep and maintenance of the property. Rental costs do not typically include regular repairs and improvements and so this is the responsibility of the tenant. Additionally, tenants cannot make significant changes to the property or decide to sell it without the permission of the owner.",
