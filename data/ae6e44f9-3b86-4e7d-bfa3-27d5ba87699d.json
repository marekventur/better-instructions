  "output": "Vegan Chili with Roasted Red Potatoes -  Begin by cooking the onions and bell peppers in olive oil over medium heat. Once they start to soften, add the black beans, and season with chili powder, cumin, and salt. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees and cut the red potatoes into small cubes. Spread the cubes onto a baking sheet, season with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and stir to coat the potatoes. Roast in the oven for 15 minutes. Once the potatoes are brown and crispy, add them to the chili and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Serve with extra toppings of your choice.",
