  "instruction": "Create an algorithm that reverses a string and explain how it works in a paragraph.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm to reverse a string takes in a string argument and iterates through it backward while appending each character to a new string. It then returns this new string, which is a reversed version of the original string. For instance, given the string \"Hello World\", the algorithm would loop through the string backward and add each character to a new string. The result would be the reversed string \"dlroW olleH\".",
