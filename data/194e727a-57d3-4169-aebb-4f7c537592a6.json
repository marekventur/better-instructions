  "output": "Once upon a time, there was an elephant who always had big plans. This elephant always dreamed of becoming a great explorer and travelling to distant lands, but he was too scared to try it. So, one day he decided to take a small step and go to the local zoo. He was so excited that he started running and ended up crashing into the zoo entrance and getting stuck there! Everyone around him wanted to help, but all they could do was laugh and take pictures of the poor elephant, who was too embarrassed to get out of the entrance!",
