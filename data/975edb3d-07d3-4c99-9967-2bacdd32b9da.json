  "output": "Dear [Name], \n\nI am writing to apologize for the way I have behaved recently. I am deeply sorry for my actions. I understand now that my words and actions have caused you pain and hurt. For that, I am deeply sorry and want to apologize for my mistakes and wrongdoings.\n\nI want you to know that I am genuinely sorry for what I have done and I feel really bad about how I handled the situation. I regret my words and my behavior and want to make sure that I will never hurt someone like that again.\n\nI understand that my behavior was not acceptable and it doesn't reflect who I am. I want to take this opportunity to better myself, to be a more respectful person, and to make sure that I will never hurt someone the way I did.\n\nI don't expect you to forgive me, but I hope that you will in time. Again, I am truly sorry for causing you hurt and distress. \n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",
