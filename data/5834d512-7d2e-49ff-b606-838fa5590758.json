  "input": "",
  "output": "Implementing a more stringent emissions policy can have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, an increased focus on reducing emissions can lead to a cleaner environment and improved air quality. It can also spur innovation in green energy technology. On the negative side, implementing stricter emissions rules could lead to increased costs for businesses and individuals, as well as reduced economic prosperity overall if not implemented carefully. Additionally, there can be political tensions as different countries negotiate how to divide the burden of emissions reduction. All in all, drastic changes to emissions policy should be done thoughtfully and carefully, taking into consideration all the benefits and drawbacks.",
