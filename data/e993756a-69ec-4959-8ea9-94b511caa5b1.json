  "output": "One way to reduce deforestation is to increase the availability of sustainable materials, such as bamboo and other rapidly renewable resources. By setting up sustainable forestry operations that harvest and replant these materials, businesses can reduce their demand for timber harvested from rainforests. Additionally, promoting reforestation efforts, such as planting trees and paying people who live in deforested areas to protect remaining forests, can help combat deforestation.",
