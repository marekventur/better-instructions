  "instruction": "Describe the following model architecture.",
  "input": "Model architecture consists of 4 convolution layers followed by a fully connected layer and a softmax layer.",
  "output": "The model has 4 convolution layers followed by a fully connected layer and a softmax layer. Each convolution layer has a kernel size of 3x3 and a stride length of 1. Following this is a fully connected layer that flattens the output of the convolution layers into a single vector. The final layer is a softmax layer, which outputs a probability distribution over any given class or label.",
