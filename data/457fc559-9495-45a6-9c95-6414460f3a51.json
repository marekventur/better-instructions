  "output": "The parts of a cell include the nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria, and other organelles. The nucleus is the control center of the cell and contains the genetic material, while the cytoplasm is the gel-like material that fills the cell and contains the organelles. The cell membrane is a semi-permeable barrier that regulates what enters and leaves the cell. Mitochondria are the \"powerhouses\" of the cell, providing energy to the cell.",
