  "output": "First of all, you should make sure that there is no paper jam in the printer. To do so, open the printer and make sure that there are no pieces of paper or other foreign objects stuck in the printer. If there are, carefully remove them. Then, check the paper tray and ensure that it is correctly loaded. If needed, remove any paper that is misaligned or crumpled. Finally, restart the printer and try printing again.",
