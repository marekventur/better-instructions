  "output": "Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the concept of machines possessing the same cognitive capabilities as humans. It is the goal of many AI researchers and developers and seeks to create computers or machines with human-like intelligence. AGI differs from traditional AI in that it seeks to create a general artificial intelligence that is able to think like humans, rather than being programmed to solve specific problems as most traditional AI models are. AGI aims to create machines that are able to think, understand, reason, and perform tasks like humans.",
