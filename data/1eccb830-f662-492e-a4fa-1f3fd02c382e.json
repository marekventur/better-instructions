  "input": "",
  "output": "Photosythesis is a process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and sugar. During photosynthesis, light energy is captured by chloroplasts, which contain photosynthetic pigments, and used to produce energy-rich molecules like glucose. This energy is in turn used to form complex organic compounds like proteins and fats.",
