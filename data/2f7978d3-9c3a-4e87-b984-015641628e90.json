  "output": "A typical summer day in the desert can be described as bright and sunny, with temperatures reach near boiling. The skies are clear and the sun is hot, forming a stark contrast against the scenery. By midday, the air is often still and stuffy, with sporadic gusts of hot and dry wind, while in the evening, the heat dissolves into a mild temperate night. During this time, the stars and moon hide behind an array of vibrant blues while animals and insects come out to play.",
