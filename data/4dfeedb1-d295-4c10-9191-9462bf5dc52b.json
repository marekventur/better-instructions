  "input": "Problem: Design an algorithm for finding a given number in an array of integers\nSolution: \nLoop through the array and compare each element with the number. If the number is found, break the loop and return true. Otherwise return false.",
  "output": "The proposed solution is an effective algorithm for finding a given number in an array of integers. It is relatively simple to implement and runs in linear time, meaning its time complexity is O(n). Additionally, it avoids the space complexity of other more complex algorithms, making it preferable in some cases.",
