  "instruction": "Explain how the Gini index is calculated.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The Gini index is a measure of economic inequality calculated by taking the ratio of the area between the Lorenz curve and the hypothetical line of perfect equality to the total area under the line of perfect equality. The Lorenz curve is a graph that plots the cumulative proportion of total income earned by the bottom x% of a population against the cumulative percentage of the population itself. It is calculated by first finding the cumulative percentage of income earned by consecutive segments of the population; these values are then plotted against the cumulative percent of the population and connected. The result is a line that shows cumulative income earned by the bottom x% of the population beneath the 45-degree line of perfect equality. The Gini index is then calculated by taking the area of the triangle beneath the Lorenz curve and above the line of perfect equality, divided by the total area beneath the line of perfect equality. This calculation results in a number between 0 and 1; 0 indicates perfect equality and 1 indicates perfect inequality. \n \u00a7\u00a7 --- README.md\n-You are asked to come up with a set of 20 diverse task instructions.
