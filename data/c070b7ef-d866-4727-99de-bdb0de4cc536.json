  "input": "",
  "output": "The most efficient way to heat a large space is to use a central heating system, such as a furnace, boiler, or heat pump. This type of system allows the heat to be distributed throughout the entire space evenly and consistently, providing the most efficient heating. Additionally, they are capable of being zoned, which allows certain areas to be heated more than others depending on the occupancy.",
