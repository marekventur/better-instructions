  "input": "",
  "output": "Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection states that populations evolve over time through natural selection of organisms with desirable variations that are best adapted to their environment. This evolutionary process explains the change in the characteristics and diversity of organisms over time as different variations are preserved and passed down to subsequent generations, allowing for organisms to evolve and adapt to their environment. This knowledge was invaluable to scientists in helping explain why living organisms have adapted and evolved over time, a process now known as speciation.",
