  "input": "Proposed project: Opening a new cafe",
  "output": "The proposed project of opening a new cafe can be evaluated with a cost-benefit analysis to gauge potential returns. The potential costs include renting or purchasing a building, obtaining licenses and permits, purchasing equipment, hiring employees and advertising. The potential benefits include generating sales revenue, cutting costs compared to going to an existing cafe, and having an additional presence in the area. The analysis should also consider any external factors, such as competition in the area or any economic downturns that could affect the cafe's success.",
