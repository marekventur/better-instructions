  "input": "",
  "output": "Entrepreneurs utilize crowdfunding by using online platforms to raise money for their projects or businesses. They create campaigns on crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo to promote their ideas, share their stories, and collect pledges from investors. Crowdfunding campaigns are typically open-ended, meaning they may continue to raise funds until they reach their goal or their deadline. Once a crowdfunding campaign is successful, rewards or equity can be offered as a way of thanking the investors. In many cases, the funds raised via crowdfunding can also be used to launch and promote the entrepreneur\u2019s product or service.",
