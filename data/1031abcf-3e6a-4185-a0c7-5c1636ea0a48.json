  "input": "",
  "output": "Mental models are ways of understanding and conceptualizing information. They provide a framework for understanding how various ideas, facts, and concepts fit together. Mental models are useful for categorizing and organizing information in order to draw meaningful conclusions. They are often visualized as a diagram or graph that represents the relationships among the components of an idea. A mental model is used to make sense of complex ideas or situations and allow an individual to better process and remember them.",
