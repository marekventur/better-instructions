  "input": "",
  "output": "Gradient descent is a process used in linear regression to find the values for the parameters (coefficients) of a linear equation that minimize a given cost function. The process works by taking the derivative of the cost function to find the direction of steepest descent, then adjusting the parameters accordingly. The process is iterative, and each iteration reduces the cost of the model until an optimal parameter values is reached. Gradient descent can also be used in logistic regression to maximize the likelihood of the data.",
