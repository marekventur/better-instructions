  "output": "O'er the top of the trees\nThe sun starts to greet,\nPainting the sky a deep ruby hue\nA calming breeze that stirs up leaves\nA clear sight, one could not lose. \n\nThe shadows cast, dark and still\nAs the beasts below await a thrill\nThe new beginnings of the day\nLays hope in an endless fray.",
