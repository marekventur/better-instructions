  "output": "Michelangelo was born in 1475 in a Tuscan town near Florence, Italy. He was the son of a government administrator, and studied sculpture and painting from a young age. Although he was trained in the traditional painter's techniques, he also had a passionate quest for learning. His curiosity and interest in the sciences and literature was extraordinary for his age. During his life, he traveled around Europe, and had the opportunity to work for some of the most important patrons of the Renaissance time. He died in 1564 in Rome, Italy at the age of 89. His life and career was always spent intending to inspire and bring a level of skill to the visual arts that would create arguably the most impressive body of work in the history of art.",
