  "input": "",
  "output": "The argument that global warming is a hoax is largely unsupported. Recent scientific findings indicate that the Earth is indeed warming at an alarming rate, and human activities are the major cause of this warming. On top of this, the only evidence that skeptics have presented to suggest that global warming is a hoax is anecdotal, and has not been verified by any scientific methodologies. Overall, the argument that global warming is a hoax is not supported by any reliable evidence.",
