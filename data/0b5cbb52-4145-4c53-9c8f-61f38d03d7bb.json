  "input": "",
  "output": "One way a technology company can increase customer engagement is by offering loyalty rewards for their customers. This could include discounts, exclusive offers, special events and rewards for customers who use their products. They could also use social media to connect with customers more directly and proactively create conversations about the product. Finally, the company should regularly offer incentives for customers to provide feedback and survey responses, as this can help the company better understand what customers want and identify how to improve their customer experience.",
