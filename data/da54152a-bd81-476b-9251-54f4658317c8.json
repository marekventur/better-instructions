  "output": "The human brain is an amazing and complex organ made up of billions of neurons that are responsible for processing sensory information as well as initiating and controlling body functions. It is composed of three major parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. The cerebrum is responsible for our thoughts, actions, language, and higher level functions. The cerebellum is responsible for balance and muscle coordination. The brainstem connects the brain to the spinal cord, and is responsible for basic body functions such as breathing, blood pressure, and involuntary movements.",
