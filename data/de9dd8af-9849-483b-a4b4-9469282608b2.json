  "output": "Natural language processing (NLP) can be used to develop customer service chatbots that are able to understand, interpret, and respond to customer queries quickly and accurately. NLP-based chatbots can help reduce customer service costs and improve customer satisfaction by providing customers with quick, accurate answers to their questions without needing to speak to an agent. NLP can also enable better customer segmentation by analyzing customer conversations to gain more detailed insights into customer needs, preferences, and intentions.",
