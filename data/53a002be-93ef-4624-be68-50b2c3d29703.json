  "instruction": "Provide feedback on the following essay.",
  "input": "This essay is about the importance of language. Language is a very important tool to communicate with one another. It is used to share ideas and feelings, as well as providing a way to understand and express points of view. Without language, communication would be limited and would not be nearly as effective.",
  "output": "This essay does a great job of emphasizing the importance of language. However, it could benefit from a deeper analysis and more specific examples. For example, what are some of the distinct ways in which language can communicate ideas and feelings that would be nearly impossible with any other form of communication? Additionally, the essay could delve further into the benefits of understanding multiple languages and describe the wide-reaching implications of this linguistic understanding.",
