  "input": "",
  "output": "Bitcoin is a decentralized system because it operates through a network of computers distributed around the world, rather than relying on a central authority or server. This ensures that no single individual or organization can take control of the currency or have access to all the information about it. It also means that the system can operate independently of governments and other organizations.",
