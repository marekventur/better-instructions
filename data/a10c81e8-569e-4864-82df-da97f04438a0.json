  "output": "Alice was out in the park, happily throwing a ball up in the air and catching it. Suddenly, a strong gust of wind came out of nowhere and Alice\u2019s ball went flying, far away in the distance. Undaunted, Alice grabbed her trusty umbrella and started running across the park. After winding her way through pathways, trees, and flower beds, she eventually reached a small hill. Looking up, Alice could see her ball suspended atop the hill. She slowly climbed the hill, careful not to slip, holding onto the umbrella for support. At the top of the hill, she finally retrieved her lost ball, proudly holding it in the air with her faithful umbrella beside her.",
