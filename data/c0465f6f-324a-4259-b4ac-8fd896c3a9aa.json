  "input": "",
  "output": "The success of a neural network can be measured by assessing accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics on a dataset. In addition, evaluating the network's performance on unseen data can provide insight into the network's generalization ability. Finally, evaluating the network architecture and hyperparameters can give an indication of the network's ability to learn from data.",
