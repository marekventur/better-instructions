  "input": "",
  "output": "A learning style is how one absorbs and processes information. Not every learner is the same, so there are different learning styles that suit different people. Visual learners, for example, learn best through images and diagrams, while auditory learners learn best through lectures, conversations, and discussions. Kinesthetic learners are active learners, who learn best through hands-on activities and experiential learning. Knowing your own learning style can help you devise strategies to maximize your potential.",
