  "output": "American public education overall is lacking in comparison to countries across the world in terms of academic quality and student performance. Many schools lack the necessary resources, funding, and technology to give students the best possible education. Furthermore, poverty, inequality, and institutional racism persist in the education system, compounded by a lack of access to quality teaching and instruction.",
