  "output": "The muscular system is made up of hundreds of muscles that work together to generate movement and stability in the body. Its main function is to move the bones and joints, as well as to generate heat, posture, and organ movement. Additionally, it helps to maintain blood circulation, move food through the digestive system, and maintain blood pressure. Muscles are made up of protein filaments and elastic fibers that contract and relax in response to nerve impulses and cause body motion.",
