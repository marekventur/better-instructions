  "input": "Laptop, printer, desk lamp",
  "output": "A laptop is the best item for a college student to buy since it provides the most versatility and usefulness. A laptop can be used for completing assignments, conducting research, watching lectures, and much more. A printer is still necessary for some assignments, but a laptop will provide the student with more options and make it easier to complete any type of task. A desk lamp is a nice item to have but is not as necessary as a laptop.",
