  "instruction": "Describe the natural language processing tasks you can do with GPT-3.",
  "input": "No input",
  "output": "GPT-3 can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as: text generation, machine translation, text classification, question answering, summarization, genre detection, parsing, sentiment analysis, information extraction, entity recognition, and text clustering. Moreover, GPT-3 can also be used to build interactive applications, such as dialog systems or chatbots. Finally, GPT-3 can be used to extend the capabilities of other machine learning models, such as providing additional data or insights to train a model to perform certain tasks more accurately.",
