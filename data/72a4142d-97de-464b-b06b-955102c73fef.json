  "instruction": "Assume you are an art collector and are on the lookout for artwork. What questions would you ask a gallery?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "I would ask the gallery about the artists they feature, in order to get a better understanding of their selection. I would also ask about their process for authenticating the artwork, as well as the support and resources they provide for preserving the artwork. I would also inquire about the pricing, payment methods, and shipping policies. Additionally, I would ask about their return policy and any additional services they provide such as installation and conservation.",
