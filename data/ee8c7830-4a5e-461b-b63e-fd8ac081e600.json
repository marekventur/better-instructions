  "output": "When applying machine learning to a specific problem, one would expect to see the development of a model that is able to automate certain processes and make predictions based on the data given. This could include patterns in the data that were previously unseen or uncovering correlations between different variables. Additionally, the model should improve in accuracy over time as more data is added and it is trained on new examples.",
