  "output": "I will plan a surprise birthday party for my friend by first finding out his/her favorite things and creating a guest list of people who he/she is close with. Then I will book a venue that is suitable for that theme, pick a date and time, outline a budget and start to shop for decorations and supplies. I will also create an invitation list and send them to the guests. On the day of the party, I will prepare snacks, drinks and activities for our guests, set up the decorations and make sure that everything is ready. Lastly, I will plan a surprise at the end of the party to create a lasting memory for my friend.",
