  "input": "Short Story:\nRob had always been a carefree soul, always dreaming and rarely planning. When he graduated from college, he thought he'd take his time to figure out what he wanted to do next. So, he found a job as a barista at a small cafe, and thought he would use the time to travel and explore the world. Before he knew it, Rob was happy with his job, endearing himself to all who worked with him and lived life with carefree abandon.",
  "output": "Rob graduated from college and chose to work at a cafe instead of immediately pursuing a career. He enjoyed spending time with the other employees, learning from them and savoring life's little moments. Living with a carefree spirit, Rob cares for those around him and does not worry about the future.",
