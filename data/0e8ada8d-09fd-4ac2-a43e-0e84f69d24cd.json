  "input": "",
  "output": "Weather and climate are both related to atmospheric conditions. Weather is the short-term atmospheric conditions that occur over a single day, or even a few hours. It consists of temperature, precipitation, thunderstorms, winds and other short-term atmospheric phenomena and is constantly changing. Climate, on the other hand, is the average weather conditions that occur over a long period of time (usually at least 30 years), and is relatively consistent in an area. Climate is the result of many factors, such as latitude, elevation, topography, wind patterns and seasonal variations. While weather and climate are related, they are not the same. Weather is the atmospheric condition of a given day or location, while climate is what we can expect from the atmosphere over a much longer period of time.",
