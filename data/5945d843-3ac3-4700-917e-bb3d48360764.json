  "output": "After years of searching, scientists had finally found what they were looking for! Deep in the heart of the jungle, they had discovered a species of animal never seen before. The creature was roughly the size of a large antelope, with bright yellow fur and massive antlers spreading out from its head. \n\nThe first reaction from the scientists was shock. After all, this was the first time any creature like this had ever been discovered. But it soon became clear that the discovery was of great importance to science and the world at large. For example, the creature's antlers had given the scientists clues as to how this species adapted and evolved in the jungle. \n\nBut what fascinated the scientists the most was the mystery of how the species had remained undiscovered for so long. Word of the find spread quickly and soon, the species became something of an international celebrity. Its name? The Yellow Stag of the Jungle!",
