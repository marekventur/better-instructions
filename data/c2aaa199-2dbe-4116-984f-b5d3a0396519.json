  "input": "",
  "output": "To prevent marine pollution from plastic, it is important to focus on both prevention and clean-up strategies. To prevent plastic from entering ocean waters, it is important to reduce plastic production and consumption as much as possible. This can include using reusable packaging when possible, avoiding single-use plastics, and reducing plastic packaging when possible. Other options include changing disposal habits, such as improving and enforcing waste management practices. Additionally, education and awareness campaigns can be effective at encouraging people to be mindful of the plastic they use. For clean-up, companies and organizations can launch initiatives to collect and clean-up plastics that have already entered the ocean, using devices such as large nets or drones equipped with malware. Finally, developing and investing in better technologies, such as biodegradable plastics, can help reduce the amount of plastic entering the environment.",
