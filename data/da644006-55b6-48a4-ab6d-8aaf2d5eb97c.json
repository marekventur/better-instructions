  "output": "Painting tutorials for beginners can include simple tasks such as tracing a picture or object with a pencil to familiarize yourself with the way your chosen medium behaves, using practice brushes to getting comfortable with the brushstroke, and using basic paint colors to create simple compositions. Once you\u2019ve practiced painting with a brush, you can start experimenting with different mediums such as watercolors, acrylics, and pastels. With practice, you can learn to mix colors, use light and shade, and even create reliable copies of pieces of art.",
