  "output": "There are several criteria which can be used to evaluate machine learning models. Examples include accuracy, precision, recall, auc, f1 score, false positive rate, false negative rate, specificity, sensitivity, cost as well as feedback, user centric qualities and other metrics related to the problem. Models should also be evaluated for robustness, scalability and security, as applicable.",
