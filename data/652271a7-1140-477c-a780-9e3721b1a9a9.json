  "input": "ABC Company, a leader in its industry, has been accused of taking advantage of its customers. The company offers a wide variety of products that promise quick and easy solutions, but often times the products do not work as promised. Advanced versions of the same products are then sold at a higher price, making it difficult for customers to get the results they paid for.",
  "output": "ABC Company is engaging in unethical business practices by preying on their customers' lack of knowledge with false promises and deceptive pricing. By offering a variety of products at different prices, the company is able to entice customers to purchase the more expensive options under the false premise that they offer better results. This practice is unethical because it exploits consumers who are unaware of the full cost and potential of their purchase.",
