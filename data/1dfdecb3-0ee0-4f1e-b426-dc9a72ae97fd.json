  "output": "Climate change has major implications for the agricultural sector, particularly in the form of reduced crop yields, increased drought and water scarcity, increased occurrence of natural disasters, increased prevalence of pests and diseases, and forced migration from rural areas to cities. Furthermore, climate change has led to rising temperatures, higher sea levels, increased water salinity, and a decrease in availability of fresh water as precipitation patterns change. As a result, agricultural production is expected to decline particularly in areas where temperatures are already close to the optimal range for crop growth. Extreme weather conditions will lead to disruptions in production and transportation of food supplies, leading to a decline in food security. The repercussions of these effects will be most severely felt in the developing world, where agricultural activities are an integral part of the economy.",
