They decided to take a walk in the woods near by and that's when one of them noticed they had dropped a valuable item. \nPanic set in and they began scouring the ground, desperately searching for the lost item. After what felt like hours of searching, they eventually found the lost item and hugged each other in relief. They laughed and agreed that this would make a great story to tell later.",
