  "output": "Electricity is like a river. The source of the river is the electrical generator, and the river flows through the wires like electricity flows through circuits. The current of the river is like the amount of electricity flowing, and the resistance is like the size of the river channel. The attraction between two objects, like the positive and negative charges, is like the current of the river pushing them away from each other. As electricity moves through a circuit, the river always finds its way to the ground, just like electricity finds a way to ground itself.",
