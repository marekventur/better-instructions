  "output": "Two ideas on how to promote a computer science course include: \n1. Creating a video testimonial featuring former students who have taken the course to highlight the course benefits and potential career paths. \n2. Hosting a live event featuring the professor and students who have taken the course and inviting students who are interested in the course. This event could include a Q&A session to allow potential students to ask questions, and the professor can give an overview of the course content and discuss career paths.",
