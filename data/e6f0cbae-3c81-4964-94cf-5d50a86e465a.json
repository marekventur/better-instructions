  "output": "The War of 1812 was fought between the United States and the United Kingdom from June 1812 to February 1815. The British forces had the upper hand at the start of the war, with the U.S. unable to gain a strategic victory due to a lack of support from the French. By 1814, the U.S. had gained momentum and achieved many victories, although the war ended in a stalemate with neither side gaining a decisive victory.",
