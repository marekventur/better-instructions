  "output": "The difference between an audience and a spectator is that an audience is generally a group of people assembled together to witness a performance, while a spectator is an individual viewing an event. An audience is usually more interactive than a spectator, engaging with the performers and reacting to the performance, while a spectator is usually more passive, simply observing the event.",
