  "input": "",
  "output": "Positive self-talk is a mental strategy used to challenge negative thoughts, motivate yourself, and increase self-confidence. It is a cognitive reframing practice used to replace negative beliefs and dialogue with positive affirmations and realistic optimism. Negative self-talk on the other hand, consists of negative thoughts, judgments, and criticism directed at oneself. It is often a sign of low self-esteem and can create feelings of hopelessness.",
