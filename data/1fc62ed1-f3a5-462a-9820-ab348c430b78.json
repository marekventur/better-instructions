  "output": "Dark energy is an enigmatic form of energy which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. It is theorized to be the energy that exists between galaxies, driving them apart and thus causing the universe to expand. This energy is difficult to measure directly as it is not concentrated in one area and its effects become apparent only over very large distances. Its precise nature is not yet known, but it is believed to be an intrinsic characteristic of space that has been active since the birth of the universe.",
