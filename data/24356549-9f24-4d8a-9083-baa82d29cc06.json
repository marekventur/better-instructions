  "instruction": "Analyze a current controversial issue and determine which side you agree with and why.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "I agree with the side that opposes the current policy of separating families at the US-Mexico border. This policy is a cruel, inhumane act that goes against basic human rights and is causing significant trauma and emotional distress to those affected. Furthermore, it is creating unnecessary hardships and economic costs for those seeking asylum and is contrary to our stated values and ideals. We must do better, and I believe that the best way to achieve this is to reject this policy.",
