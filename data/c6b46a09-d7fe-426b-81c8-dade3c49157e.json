  "instruction": "Describe an ideal vacation for the given person.",
  "input": "Someone who needs to relax and is an outdoor enthusiast.",
  "output": "For someone looking to relax and embrace their love of the outdoors, an ideal vacation would be a weeklong hiking and camping trip in the Rocky Mountains. On the way, they would stop to explore the local towns and attractions along the route, so that they can take in the culture and enjoy the local sights. During the hiking, they could find plenty of time to relax and recharge as they take in the beautiful mountain views and explore the paths. Along the trip, they can choose to stop and camp for the night, giving them a great opportunity to disconnect and immerse themselves in nature. In the end, they'll return with renewed energy and a greater appreciation for the beauty of the outdoors.",
