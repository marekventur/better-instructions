  "input": "",
  "output": "Robotics is becoming increasingly important in engineering as automation and artificial intelligence become vital components of the work being done. With the growing prevalence of robots in manufacturing, healthcare and other industries, knowledge of robotics is essential in order to stay competitive in the industry. Furthermore, understanding of robotic logic and programming can help engineers create better and more efficient automation solutions. Additionally, robotic systems often rely on complex algorithms and sophisticated technology, and knowledge of robotics allows engineers to better understand these systems and create better designs. Finally, robots are more resilient, so understanding robotics can help engineers design robots that can withstand physical stress, such as working in extreme temperatures. Ultimately, knowledge of robotics is becoming essential for engineers who need to stay ahead of the technology curve.",
