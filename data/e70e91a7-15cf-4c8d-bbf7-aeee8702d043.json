  "output": "Blue Ocean Strategy is an approach to business that focuses on creating a new market and value network, as opposed to competing in an existing industry. It is focused on creating uncontested market space and redirecting the principal forces of competition. In other words, it involves creating a new environment rather than engaging in a cut-throat war with competitors. The aim is to come up with ways to make the competition irrelevant by making it irrelevant. It involves focusing on making the company's offerings more attractive to the customer and creating a market where customers would demand the services or products.",
