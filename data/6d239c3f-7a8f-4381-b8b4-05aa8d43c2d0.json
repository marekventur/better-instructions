  "input": "",
  "output": "Computer systems can detect fake news by using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect slang, sentiment, bias and context clues in the text. They may also use machine learning models to compare the text to known sources of fake news, as well as other suspicious patterns. Additionally, fact-checking algorithms can be used to identify inconsistencies between different sources of information. Finally, computer systems can analyze the authors of known fake news and use these insights to identify similar authors and articles.",
