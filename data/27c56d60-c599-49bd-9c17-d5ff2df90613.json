  "output": "Algorithm for Solving a Rubik's Cube for Beginners\n1. Find and place the white cross: Find the side with a solid white color and turn it until the edge pieces with white centers match up with the white side.\n2. Place the white corners: Hold the cube so that the solved center pieces face up and right. Turn the cube so that a white corner piece is in the forward-right-top position. If the corner you want is already in the top layer, turn the top layer until the desired corner is in the forward-right-top position. Then twist the upper layer so that the corner fits into the right slot. \n3. Solve the middle layer: Look for two edge pieces needing to be swapped and position them so that they form a line when viewed from the top. Then twist the middle layer so that the two edge pieces are in the correct slot.\n4. Solve the bottom cross: Look for the cross pieces and line them up with the cross on the bottom layer. Then twist the bottom layer until the cross pieces match up the correct slots.\n5. Position the yellow corners : Hold the cube so that the bottom layer has the solved cross. Line up the yellow corner pieces with the yellow side of the cube. Then twist the bottom layer until the corner pieces snap into place. \n6. Finally, solve the yellow edges: View the cube from the top and look for the two edge pieces which need to be swapped. Line up the two edge pieces so that they form a line when viewed from the top. Then twist the bottom layer until the two edges match up in the correct slots.",
