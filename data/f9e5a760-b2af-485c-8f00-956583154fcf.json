  "input": "",
  "output": "3D printers have wide-ranging applications in many industries, from printing prototypes and industry-specific parts to conducting research and development. However, 3D printing presents many challenges that must be overcome in order for it to be used in commercial and industrial settings. These challenges include the cost of production, design limitations, safety issues, and copyright issues. Cost of production is an especially critical challenge; 3D printing can be more expensive than traditional manufacturing methods due to the cost of 3D printer materials, software, and start-up equipment. Design limitations can be an issue due to the complex geometry that must be created in order to print parts and prototypes. Safety issues also arise due to the thermal and powder hazards that must be considered. Additionally, copyright issues must be thoughtfully addressed to avoid infringement of someone else\u2019s work.",
