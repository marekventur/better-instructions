  "input": "",
  "output": "Global warming has had a significant impact on the Arctic region, resulting in melting glaciers and sea ice, rising sea levels, and changes in weather patterns and wildlife habitats. Warmer temperatures are causing permafrost to thaw, releasing greenhouse gases that further contribute to global warming. Additionally, warmer temperatures have led to decreases in snow and ice cover, further exacerbating the effects of climate change on the Arctic region.",
