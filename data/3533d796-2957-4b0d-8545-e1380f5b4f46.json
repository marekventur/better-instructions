  "instruction": "Generate a paragraph that discusses the concept of net neutrality.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers should treat all data on the Internet the same, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or method of communication. It means that Internet service providers should give their customers open access to all lawful content and applications on an equal basis, no matter which service or product a customer is using. Net neutrality is important for preserving the freedom of expression, choice, and innovation on the web, as well as for protecting consumers from discrimination. Without net neutrality, ISPs could prioritize certain types of content, block certain applications, or throttle connection speeds, all of which could significantly affect user experience.",
