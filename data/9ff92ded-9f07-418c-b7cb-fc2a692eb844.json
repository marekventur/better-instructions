  "input": "",
  "output": "Nuclear energy is a form of energy that is released during the process of nuclear fission. It is generated by splitting atoms, usually Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, to release a large amount of energy in the form of heat. This heat can then be used to drive turbines and generate electricity, or to produce heat for industrial processes. Nuclear energy is a clean form of energy and has a low carbon footprint.",
