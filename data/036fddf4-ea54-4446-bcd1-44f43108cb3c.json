  "input": "Family Budget:\nIncome: $15,000\nSavings Goal: $2,500\nLiving Expenses: $11,000",
  "output": "The budget plan should include income, expenses, and savings goals. For example, a family with an income of $15,000, living expenses of $11,000, and a savings goal of $2,500 should set aside $2,500 for savings, allocate $11,000 for living expenses, and have $1,500 left for other discretionary spending. The family should also plan for unexpected expenses, such as emergency medical costs or car repairs, by setting aside 5-10% of their income each month in an emergency fund.",
