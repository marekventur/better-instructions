  "input": "",
  "output": "Plants respire by taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide in a process called cellular respiration. During photosynthesis, plants use energy from sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose. During respiration, which occurs both day and night, glucose is converted back into carbon dioxide and water. This process releases energy for the plant's cells to use for growth and development.",
