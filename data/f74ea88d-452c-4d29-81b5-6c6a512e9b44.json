  "output": "The sky was filled with endless blue,\nWith stars that shone like diamonds too.\nThe sun cast its gentle, radiant hue,\nAnd begged me to start anew.\n\nThe birds sang in a melodic style,\nSoftly whispering through the vale.\nSparkling streams floated as they smiled,\nEnchanting souls as they sailed.\n\nThe trees stood tall from forest floor,\nLiving and powering evermore;\nMy heart yearned for something more,\nRoots and leaves held closed the door.\n\nThe moonlight cast its ethereal glow,\nNature filled my spirit with hope and woe.\nAnd although I may never truly know,\nThe beauty of Nature still left me aglow.",
