  "output": "A current cybersecurity risk is phishing, a type of social engineering attack. Phishing can occur through email, websites, or text messages designed to fraudulently obtain sensitive information such as passwords or financial details. The attacker impersonates a legitimate user to gain trust, usually using deceptive links or attachments, and then directs them to a malicious website or downloads malware. In addition, ransomware is another current cybersecurity risk, where attackers lock down files with encryption and then demand ransom in order to restore access.",
