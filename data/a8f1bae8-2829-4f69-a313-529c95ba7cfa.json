  "output": "A good exercise routine for weight loss should include both cardio and strength training. Start with cardio exercises such as running, cycling, or use machines like a treadmill or rowing machine. Aim for 45 minutes of moderate to intense aerobic exercise, three to five times per week. Additionally, add strength training to your routine at least twice a week. This should include exercises like push ups, squats, and pull ups. These exercises target major muscle groups and can help build muscle and increase fat burn. Finally, good nutrition is key to any successful exercise routine. Eat a balanced diet that is rich in fruit, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats.",
