  "output": "Deep in the woods, there lived the old man. He was a misanthropic hermit known to shun visitors and passersby and spend his life in isolation. One day, an old woman with a gruesome face and torn clothes stumbled upon his cottage and begged him to take her in and protect her from a great terror she could not speak of. Reluctantly, the old man granted her wish, but soon found himself consumed by shadows and the haunting memories of the past. Soon, he began to hear the howls of a creature from the woods, which drove him further and further into madness. Eventually, the old man was never seen again, but his memory lingers to this day along with the tales of a creature still lurking in the shadows.",
