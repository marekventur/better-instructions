  "input": "",
  "output": "Endangered species should be preserved because they are essential to ecosystems and provide valuable resources for humans. Without them, entire food webs could collapse and the balance of nature could be disrupted. Endangered species also play a role in maintaining biodiversity, which is important for a healthy planet. Furthermore, endangered species provide resources for medicine and other products, some of which may not be possible to replicate. By preserving endangered species, we ensure that our planet's delicate balance and resources are maintained.",
