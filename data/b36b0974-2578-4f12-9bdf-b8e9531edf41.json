  "instruction": "Tell me why a banker would calculate loan interest rates.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A banker would calculate loan interest rates to determine the cost of borrowing money and to help set a loan amount that will be manageable for the borrower to pay back. By calculating and setting the interest rate, the loan is more likely to be repaid in full. The interest rate also helps the banker to generate profit from lending money and is a factor when determining the loan's eligibility for borrowers.",
