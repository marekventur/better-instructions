  "input": "",
  "output": "Making data visible in an organization can be accomplished through the use of data visualization tools such as charts, graphs, and tables, as well as interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities. It is also important to assign ownership to the data and define governance processes for how the data will be used. Having a data-driven culture is essential for data visibility, which can be achieved through education, investment in technology and data governance, and encouraging data-driven decision making.",
