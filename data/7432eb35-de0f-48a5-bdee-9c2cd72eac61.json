  "input": "",
  "output": "Covid-19 has had a drastic impact on the education system around the world. With the sudden closure of schools, universities, and other educational institutions, over 1.2 billion students have had their learning disrupted. With the switch to online learning, teaching and learning techniques also had to change abruptly. This impeded the learning process as not all students had access to the required technological resources to continue their education. There have been new initiatives and policies introduced to ensure students get the necessary support to continue their learning. However, there have been issues with inadequate devices and affordable access to the internet, especially in rural and disadvantaged areas. In addition, the potential of digital learning to effectively provide quality education is still uncertain.",
