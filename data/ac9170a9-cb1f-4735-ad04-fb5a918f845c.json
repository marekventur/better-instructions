  "output": "It is impossible to accurately predict the cost of living in the US five years from now. However, it is predicted that the cost of living will continue to increase, as it has done in the past. This is due to the rising cost of resources, labor, and services. Additionally, inflation rates, taxes, and other economic factors may influence the cost of living.",
