  "output": "I would design a web page with a simple layout that incorporates visual elements to make the page modern and attractive. The page should have a menu bar with navigation links to each page of the website. There should be a main section with the content, which can be divided into sections or columns as necessary. Finally, there should be a footer with links to social media accounts and contact information.",
