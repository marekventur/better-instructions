  "input": "",
  "output": "A process for classifying text into two categories can involve several steps. First, the text is preprocessed to remove any stopwords and punctuation. Then, feature extraction techniques such as n-grams, tokenization, and TF-IDF are used to create a feature space from the input text. Finally, a classification algorithm such as support vector machines or Naive Bayes is used to make predictions on the text.",
