Cross Method: a method for solving the middle layer of the cube, which involves forming a cross shape with the correct colors.\n3. OLL: a method that solves the outside layer of the cube.\n4. PLL: a method that solves the inside layer of the cube.\n5. Combination Method: a method that combines Layer-by-Layer and Cross Method to solve the cube quickly.",
