Residents were left stunned by the destruction of the storm, which left homes and businesses damaged, power lines down, and trees uprooted. Emergency responders and volunteers quickly began helping out in the ravaged town, providing food and supplies to those in need and helping to clean up debris. While the destruction of the storm was immense, there were no reports of serious injuries. As the town starts to rebuild, the community has come together to provide support for one another in this difficult time.",
