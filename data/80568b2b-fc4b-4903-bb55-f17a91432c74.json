  "input": "",
  "output": "The types of bias in machine learning include sampling bias, data bias, selection bias, measurement bias, model bias and inference bias. Sampling bias occurs when the dataset is not representative of the population;data bias happens when data is skewed or incomplete; selection bias arises when data is chosen in a non-random way; measurement bias is caused by incorrect labels or noisy data; model bias arises when the model is overly reliant on specific features or data; and inference bias is caused by the model being too simplistic.",
