  "instruction": "Describe how a literary device is used in Romeo and Juliet.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the most prominent literary devices used in Romeo and Juliet is foreshadowing. In the play, Romeo's unintended prophetic warnings and anxieties hint to the audience that tragedy is unavoidable \u2014 for example, at the fateful masked party where Romeo and Juliet first meet, Romeo says that \"Parting is such sweet sorrow\" and Juliet worries, \"My grave is like to be my wedding bed\". The use of foreshadowing throughout the play helps to create a sense of heightened suspense and emotion and builds up the devastating conclusion.",
