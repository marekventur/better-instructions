  "input": "",
  "output": "The most common machine learning algorithms used for fraud detection are supervised learning algorithms, such as random forest, logistic regression, and Naive Bayes. These algorithms can process large amounts of data to detect patterns and anomalies, which can be used to identify fraudulent activities. Unsupervised learning algorithms, including clustering and deep learning, are also commonly used for fraud detection. These algorithms can detect patterns and anomalies that may not be identified by supervised learning, making them particularly effective for detecting emerging fraud trends.",
