  "output": "A good strategy for memorizing vocabulary words is to write each word down on a flashcard and review it multiple times. Associate the word with something that creates an image in your head, such as a mnemonic device, song, or movie that helps you to remember it. Additionally, use the words in conversations or practice tests to help commit them to memory.",
