  "instruction": "Generate a list of five valid reasons to go vegan",
  "input": "No Input",
  "output": "1. Improve your health: Vegan diets are generally lower in saturated fat and higher in vitamins, minerals and fibre than non-vegan diets. \n2. Help the environment: Animal agriculture is a major contributor to global warming and land, air and water pollution. \n3. Support animal welfare: Vegans do not consume animal products, so they do not take part in animal testing, slaughter and other practices that involve animal suffering. \n4. Save money: Plant-based foods are typically cheaper than animal-based foods. \n5. Support a healthier society: Vegan diets are associated with lower rates of obesity and heart disease, which can reduce healthcare costs.",
