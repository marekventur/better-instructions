  "output": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced the introduction of a bill that would make all public areas of the state smoke-free. This bill would prohibit smoking in all public areas within the state, including parks, beaches, restaurants, and bars. If the bill is approved, Florida would join the ranks of other states that have already implemented similar regulations to protect their citizens from second-hand smoke. The governor said he hoped the bill would pass through without much opposition, but he acknowledged that some citizens are likely to be concerned about their rights being violated. The bill will be reviewed by both the House and the Senate before it can become law.",
