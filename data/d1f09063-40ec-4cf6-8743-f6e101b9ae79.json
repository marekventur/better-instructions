  "output": "People find focusing on one task for a long time difficult because of several factors.  First, it is difficult to maintain focus over a long period of time without breaks or distractions. Second, multitasking can be much more efficient than focusing on one task for a long time, allowing people to accomplish more in less time. Third, the mind can become fatigued from exerting so much effort or energy over a long period of time. Finally, focusing on one task for a long time doesn\u2019t always lead to improved results or outcomes. Therefore, it can be difficult to remain focused when the task is mundane or there is no immediate reward.",
