  "output": "I have had the experience of giving presentations in front of an audience before, and it was nerve-wracking but exciting. I felt like I had a lot of pressure on my shoulders, but I knew that I had prepared well and was confident in my knowledge of the material. The audience was attentive, and I was able to successfully engage them with my presentation. After I finished, I was feeling proud and satisfied with how it had gone.",
