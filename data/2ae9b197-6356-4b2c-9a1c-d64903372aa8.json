  "output": "Once upon a time, there was an elephant named Gopi who lived on a lush, green savannah. He was the biggest and strongest elephant on the land and loved to play with all the other animals. Every morning he would wake up early, while the sun was still rising, and go down to the river to bathe.\n\nOne day, Gopi decided he wanted to explore what lies beyond the horizon. With a heart full of adventure, he set out on a journey, never looking back. Gopi journeyed through the jungle, made new friends, and even encountered a few fierce predators along the way. \n\nFinally, after days of exploring, Gopi reached the ocean and stood mesmerized by its vastness. He had come a long way from home, but he was happy that he had made the journey. With joy radiating from his every pore, Gopi raced back up the coast, back to the savannah, ready to start a new adventure tomorrow.",
