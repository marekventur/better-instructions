  "output": "Storytelling is a powerful tool in education as it helps to engage students and keep them interested in their studies. Storytelling can bring the subject to life by adding drama, emotion, and storytelling elements to learning. Furthermore, it enhances recall and understanding of the subject matter, facilitates critical thinking, and helps develop communication skills. Storytelling is also a great way to transmit cultural values and traditions and can be used to inspire and motivate students. Finally, stories can be used to help students develop greater empathy for others by helping them relate to different perspectives and experiences.",
