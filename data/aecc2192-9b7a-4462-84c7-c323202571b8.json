  "output": "One way of promoting physical activity among teens is by participating in sports or other group activities that encourage physical activity. For example, sports teams can be organized at schools or in the community where teens can get together and participate in activities such as basketball, soccer, and volleyball. Additionally, many parks and recreation centers have classes and programs that focus on physical activities. By participating in these activities, teens can learn the importance of staying active and the benefits of exercise, which can lead to a healthier lifestyle.",
