  "input": "",
  "output": "The abacus is a counting tool which was used to calculate using a base 10 system. It was used to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The abacus consists of rods and beads, and each rod represents a place value. The highest place value rod is at the left, and it represents the units column. The lower place value rods are to the right, and they represent the tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on columns. The higher place values are represented by the upper beads and the lower place values are represented by the bottom beads. The abacus works by adding and subtracting beads from each column to represent numbers.",
