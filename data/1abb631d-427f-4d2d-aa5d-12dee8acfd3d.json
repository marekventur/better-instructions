  "output": "It was a tragedy that shaped Sara's life from a young age. Her parents had died in an unexpected accident, an event that traumatized her at a young age and set her on a path of unending grief. She struggled to find a way to cope with the loss, but no amount of crying, shouting, or therapy seemed to help her. Instead, she lived with a deep pain that never left her, and a quiet emptiness that followed her everywhere she went. Sara was a strong, resilient young woman, but the tragedy of her parents' death was something that she never truly recovered from.",
