  "instruction": "Generate a data-driven analysis of the results of a survey.",
  "input": "The survey asked 600 adults between the ages of 18 and 30 whether they use mobile phones to call, text, take pictures, browse the internet, etc. 59% reported that they use mobile phones to call, 21% reported that they use them to text, and 10% use them to take pictures.",
  "output": "The survey data indicates that the majority of adults between the ages of 18 and 30 are primarily using mobile phones to call, with 59% of respondents indicating that they use their device to make a call. This indicates that traditional methods of communication such as making phone calls still remain popular among this demographic.\n\nTexting follows closely behind in usage, with 21% of adults 18-30 reported using their device to text, indicating that this form of communication is also popular but less so than making phone calls. Only 10% of adults 18-30 reported using mobile phones to take pictures, suggesting that this is not a primary use of the device.\n\nOverall, the survey results suggest that communication is still the primary use of mobile phones among adults between the ages of 18 and 30. While they do use their phones for other activities like taking pictures, it appears that calling and texting remain the two primary modes of communication.",
