  "input": "",
  "output": "Mitochondria are organelles found in most eukaryotic cells. They are the powerhouses of the cell, producing energy in the form of ATP through cellular respiration. Mitochondria are double-membrane bound organelles with a unique inner membrane that folds inward to form cristae, which increases the surface area for efficient ATP production. The inner membrane contains the enzymes of the electron transport chain which are necessary for ATP synthesis.",
