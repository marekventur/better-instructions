  "instruction": "Create a layout for a garden.",
  "input": "A garden measuring 12ft by 10ft",
  "output": "Create a symmetrical design with a focal point in the center such as a large bush or planter. Plant taller trees and shrubs in the background and shorter perennials and annuals in the front. Make pathways connecting different \u2018rooms\u2019 in the garden, allowing for walkways. Use pathways to create an interesting pattern leading from one side of the garden to the other. Plant flowers around the edges of the pathway for a colorful border.",
