  "input": "",
  "output": "The advantages of autonomous systems are that they can be used in extreme environments that would pose a risk to human workers. They can also perform repetitive and hazardous tasks, allowing humans to focus on more complex tasks. They are also cost-effective and can be used in applications where accuracy and precision are necessary. The disadvantages of autonomous systems are that they are expensive, require a high degree of maintenance, and there is a risk of malfunction, as well as ethical concerns with using autonomous machines to replace humans in certain tasks.",
