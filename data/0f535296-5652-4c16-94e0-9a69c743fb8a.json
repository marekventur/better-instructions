  "output": "One of the most memorable moments of my life was when I went bungee jumping in New Zealand. It was such a rush of adrenaline, standing on the edge of the bridge looking down at the river below. As I jumped from the bridge, I felt a moment of weightlessness before the bungee caught me. The view of the river and the mountains was breathtaking, and it was truly a once in a lifetime experience!",
