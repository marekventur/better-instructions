  "output": "Self-driving cars are equipped with a combination of sensors, cameras, and software. The sensors detect the environment around the vehicle, measuring objects like traffic lights, lane markers, and other vehicles in the vicinity. The cameras help to compare the real-world environment with maps and other data. The software then interprets the data and provides instructions to the car\u2019s actuators which control the throttle, brakes, and steering of the vehicle. Finally, the car is able to navigate without the need for a driver.",
