  "output": "1. Use banana peels to make an all-natural pesticide by crushing a ripe banana peel and then soaking it in warm water for a few hours. The resulting mixture can be used to spray plants to help keep pest away.\n\n2. Apply banana peels to the skin to combat acne and wrinkles. The enzymes and vitamins in the peel can help reduce redness and inflammation. \n\n3. Use banana peels to polish silverware.
