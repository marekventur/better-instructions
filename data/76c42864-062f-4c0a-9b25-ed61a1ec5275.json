  "input": "Presentation Context:\nThis presentation will be at a company staff meeting.",
  "output": "Good morning everyone. Today, I want to talk about discrimination in the workplace. Too often, individuals from minority or marginalized groups experience unfair judgment, bias or exclusion because of their identity. This is an issue that deserves our attention, not only because it is unjust, but also because it takes away from everyone's potential for success. We must take steps to hold each other accountable and create a safe and equitable workplace for everyone.\n\nWe as a company must recognize the power of diversity and inclusion. This means taking active steps to address unconscious bias, recognizing the qualifications and potential of individuals from diverse backgrounds, and creating an environment in which everyone's voices are heard. Together, we can create a more equitable and successful workplace.",
