  "instruction": "Describe the general structure of a GPT language generator.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A GPT language generator consists of a large language model that incorporates sub-models for open-ended questions, input-output mapping, classification, and other natural language processing tasks. Large language models are typically composed of transformer-based architectures that stack layers of neural networks to enable context-based and hierarchical understanding of language. GPT language generators are trained on large datasets in order to output realistic and responsive language. Models can be fine-tuned to explicitly target certain tasks.",
