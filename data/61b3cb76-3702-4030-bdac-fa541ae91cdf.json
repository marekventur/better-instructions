  "output": "The process of selling a house typically involves several steps including setting a listing price, listing the property on the market, staging the property, and hosting open houses and showings. Additionally, negotiations with potential buyers and inspections must be conducted before the contract is finalized and closing documents are signed. During closing, the seller typically pays all closing costs, transfers the title and keys to the buyer, and receives their proceeds from the sale.",
