  "instruction": "Construct a proposal regarding a school initiative to recycle during lunchtime",
  "input": "",
  "output": "This proposal outlines a new school initiative to adopt a recycling program during lunchtime. The goal of this program is to reduce the amount of waste generated during lunchtime by providing recycling bins in each of the school's lunchrooms. The bins will be clearly marked and each student should be encouraged to place recyclable items such as paper, plastic, cans, and bottles in the respective bins. By providing clear signage, students will be more inclined to recycle and will be encouraged to think about the environmental consequences of their lunchtime habits. Additionally, a public address system can be used to remind students to recycle each day. This initiative will increase recycling in the school and can be easily implemented with minimal resources.",
