  "input": "",
  "output": "Cheddar and Gouda are two very popular types of cheese. Cheddar has a sharp, tangy flavor that is well-suited for sandwiches and burger toppings, while Gouda has a creamy, buttery taste with a slight sweetness that pairs well with crackers and fresh fruit. Cheddar is aged anywhere from three months to two years, while Gouda is traditionally aged for around six months, giving it a smooth and mild flavor with a firmer texture. Both are great for a variety of dishes and pair nicely with different flavors.",
