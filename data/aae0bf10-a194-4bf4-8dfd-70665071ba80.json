  "output": "One strategy to improve the public education system is to prioritize professional development for educators. Investing in the education and training of teachers is essential in order to ensure that students have access to quality instruction. Professional development can take many forms, and should be tailored to the specific needs of the educators, students, and schools. Professional development should also emphasize the importance of using culturally responsive pedagogical practices, providing resources to teachers in order to ensure equitable learning opportunities for all students. Additionally, investing in teacher-mentor relationships can help to foster teacher efficacy and enthusiasm, while also helping to reduce the high rate of teacher turnover.",
