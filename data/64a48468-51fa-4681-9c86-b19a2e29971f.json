  "input": "",
  "output": "Translation is the process of expressing a message in one language, in another language. It is typically done by a professional who has a working proficiency in both languages, and may include the use of dictionaries, glossaries, specialized software and subject-specific reference materials. The result of a successful translation should convey the same meaning as the source text, in a way that is appropriate for the target audience.",
