  "input": "The Great Gatsby is a timeless classic about people's attitudes towards love, money, and power. It offers an account of the life and times of Jay Gatsby and his friends and lovers, and provides readers with insights into the pursuit of the American Dream, the pitfalls of materialism and the power of relationships. \n\nThe novel is set in the summer of 1922, when the roaring stock market, extreme wealth, and indulgence are everywhere. Gatsby's striving ambition, which drives the plot of the novel, is a clear example of the \"rags to riches\" myth.\n\nThrough the novel, Fitzgerald criticizes the issues of social class and upper-class lifestyles and attitudes. He shows how the wealthy are careless and self-indulgent and how their lavish parties are written in the sky with fireworks. Fitzgerald depicts the bleak but true reality that wealth can\u2019t buy people's happiness.",
