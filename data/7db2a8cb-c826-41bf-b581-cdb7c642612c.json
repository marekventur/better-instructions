  "output": "Joining a school club is a great way to develop new skills, make new friends, and have fun! My advice for a new student joining a club is to do your research to find the club that best fits your interests. Once you find the club you're interested in, introduce yourself to the members and ask questions - they will be happy to help. Additionally, be sure to attend club meetings regularly and participate in activities to get the most out of your experience.",
