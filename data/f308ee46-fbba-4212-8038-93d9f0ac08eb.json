  "input": "",
  "output": "Photoelectron spectroscopy is an analytical technique used to measure the binding energy of electrons in a sample. This technique can be used to determine the chemical composition and structure of a material, to identify elements, and to study their surface properties and other physical characteristics. It can also be used to study how electron orbitals are organized in molecules and atoms.",
