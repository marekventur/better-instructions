  "input": "",
  "output": "A car of the future should be fully autonomous and powered by renewable sources. It should also be lightweight, beautiful and efficient, while still providing exceptional safety. The car should have advanced software capabilities, such as the ability to predict traffic congestion and recommend alternative routes, or even automatically reroute the car around traffic in real time. The car should come equipped with a range of sensors, such as a radar system, cameras, and a lidar system to detect obstacles and hazards in the environment. For entertainment, the car should be equipped with a range of multimedia features, including immersive audio and visuals. Finally, the car should be affordable, reliable and sustainable.",
