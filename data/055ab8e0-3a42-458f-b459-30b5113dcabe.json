  "output": "Algorithm:\n1. Create an array of size 52 that represents a deck of cards ordered by suit and rank.\n2. Assign a random number to each element of the array. \n3. Sort the array using the random numbers as the keys.\n4. Take the first card of the array and assign it to the first place in the shuffled array. \n5. Take the second card of the array and assign it to the second place in the shuffled array. \n6. Repeat this process until all 52 cards have been assigned to the shuffled array.\n7. The shuffled array is the new deck of cards.",
