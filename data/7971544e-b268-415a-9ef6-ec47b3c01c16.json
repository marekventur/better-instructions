  "input": "",
  "output": "The Indian Removal Act of 1830 was a federal law that authorized the U.S. president to negotiate with Native American tribes for the exchange of their land east of the Mississippi River in exchange for territory to the west. This law led to the relocation of thousands of Native Americans, who were forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands and marched to their relocation destination, often enduring great hardship and brutality. Many Native Americans were either killed in the process or died due to the harsh conditions. The removal of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands disrupted the traditional way of life for many Tribes, and caused major political, social, and economic upheaval that is still felt today. This law also opened up the land it forcibly removed Native Americans from to white settled, effectively ending tribal control of the land.",
