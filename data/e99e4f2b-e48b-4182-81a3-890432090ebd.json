  "input": "",
  "output": "The process for securing a mortgage loan typically begins with an application, followed by an appraisal of the property. From there, the lender will review a borrower\u2019s credit score, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio to determine if they are a good candidate for a loan. If the borrower meets the lender\u2019s criteria, the loan will be approved and the closing process will begin. On the closing day, borrowers sign all the papers, pay the closing costs, and are officially given the loan.",
