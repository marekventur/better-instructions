  "input": "",
  "output": "The causes of World War I include widespread militarism and imperialism, nationalism and a desire for power and prestige, and a complex system of alliance between the European nations. Militarism was a prominent factor in the growing tension, and nations strove to increase their military power and position of influence. Imperialism was also a major cause, with nations seeking to gain power and control lands in other regions. Nationalism and a desire for power and prestige were other contributing factors, as countries sought to increase their size and strength. Finally, a complex system of alliances between the European nations meant that a conflict in one place would quickly spiral into a larger war.",
