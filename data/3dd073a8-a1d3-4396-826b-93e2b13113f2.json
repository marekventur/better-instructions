  "output": "As robots, artificial intelligence, and other technologies have become more advanced, the ethical implications of their use have come into focus. The ethical considerations of robotics can range from making sure robots are safe for humans, to the responsible use of data collected by automated systems. \n\nRobots and machines have always been used as tools to complete difficult, dangerous or tedious tasks. In recent years, however, robots have been used more and more in places that previously would\u2019ve employed human labor. This raises questions about the ethical implications of these robots having the potential to steal wages from human workers or displace them entirely. \n\nData privacy is another ethical consideration when creating and using robots. With more robots collecting data that is sensitive and potentially valuable, it is important to ensure that the data collected by robotic systems is securely stored and not used without due consideration. This is especially important when robots are used in sensitive contexts such as health care. \n\nFinally, as robots become more and more advanced, they will be able to understand and interact with humans in ways that were previously unseen. This raises questions of responsibility when using robots, especially when robots are being used as care providers. Thinking through what is and is not acceptable when creating and using robots is an important aspect of ethical considerations for robotics.",
