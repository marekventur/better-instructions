  "output": "Some ideas for a vacation destination could include: exploring the mountains of Ecuador, white-water rafting through the Pacific Northwest of the United States, or even earning a scuba diving certification in the Caribbean. If you're interested in history, why not take a trip to ancient Rome to see some of the best-preserved sites of the Roman Empire? And if you're looking for something a bit more off the beaten path, why not explore some of the untouched areas in the African continent? Whatever your preference is, there are plenty of unique and interesting places to explore around the world.",
