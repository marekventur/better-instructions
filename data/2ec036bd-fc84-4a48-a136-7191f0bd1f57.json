  "output": "The Money Tree, or Pachira aquatica, is an easy-to-care-for plant that does best in indirect light and does not need to be watered very often. It prefers well drained soil and is best when watered when the top inch of soil is dry. If the leaves start to turn yellow, this indicates that it may be getting too much water. Feed the Money Tree every other month with a water-soluble houseplant fertilizer.",
