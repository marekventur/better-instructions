  "instruction": "Explain the concept of angles of elevation and angles of depression.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Angles of elevation and angles of depression are used in trigonometry to measure the angle formed in relationship to a horizontal. An angle of elevation is the angle above the horizontal line and an angle of depression is the angle below the horizontal line. In either case, the angle is formed between the horizontal line, the observer, and the object being viewed. For example, if a person is standing on an elevated point and looking up at an object, the angle between the object and the person\u2019s eye is the angle of elevation. Likewise, if the person is looking down at an object, the angle is the angle of depression.",
