  "output": "Charles Darwin was a British naturalist who developed a theory of evolution through natural selection. He published his landmark work On the Origin of Species in 1859, which outlined the scientific basis for his theory and transformed the understanding of the natural world. Darwin traveled the world extensively, visiting South America, Australia and the Galapagos Islands among other places. He conducted scientific experiments and observations, collected specimens, and wrote prolifically. His later works included The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871 and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals in 1872. Darwin's research and writings provided the foundation for modern evolutionary biology.",
