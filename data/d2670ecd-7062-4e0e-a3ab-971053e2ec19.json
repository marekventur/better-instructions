  "input": "",
  "output": "Hitler and Stalin both rose to power in the 1920s and 30s, though they used vastly different methods. Stalin used cunning diplomacy, aided by the Soviet Union\u2019s monopoly on power and resources, while Hitler's rise was based on his appeal to German nationalism, intense propaganda, and the country\u2019s economic desperation.",
