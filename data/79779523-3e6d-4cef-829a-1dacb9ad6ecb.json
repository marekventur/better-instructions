  "input": "",
  "output": "Birds fly south during the winter because the climate is temperate, providing them with a more comfortable habitat in which to survive, find food, and raise their young. Cold weather would make it difficult for them to forage for food, and the lack of sunlight for long winter days would disturb their breeding cycles. Flying south provides them the opportunity to find a more suitable habitat for the winter time.",
