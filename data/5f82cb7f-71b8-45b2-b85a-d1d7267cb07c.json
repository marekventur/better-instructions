  "output": "For anyone looking to buy a car, the process should start by doing research. Learn about different models, features, and options. Then, create a budget to determine the type and cost of a car that fits the needs and budget. Visit dealerships to examine and test drive potential cars, and then compare prices and offers from different dealers. Make sure to read all of the terms carefully, and if necessary, consult a mechanic to get an independent review. Finally, consider the costs associated with owning a car, such as insurance and yearly taxes before signing any paperwork.",
