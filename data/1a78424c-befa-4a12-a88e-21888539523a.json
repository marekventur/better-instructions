  "input": "",
  "output": "Data preprocessing is like washing and drying your clothes before you wear them. By preprocessing the data, you remove any dirt, unneeded pieces of clothing, and wrinkles so that your data is cleaner, smoother, and more organized. Without preprocessing, the data may be filled with errors or unorganized, making it difficult to accurately analyze and interpret it. It is therefore important to preprocess the data before any analysis is conducted.",
