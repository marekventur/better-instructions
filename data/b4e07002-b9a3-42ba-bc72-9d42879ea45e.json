  "input": "",
  "output": "One item that is nearly impossible to find in stores during the pandemic is toilet paper. Many stores have implemented limits on the amount of toilet paper that people can purchase, due to the high demand and limited availability.\n\nAnother item that is nearly impossible to find in stores during the pandemic is cleaning supplies, such as hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. The high demand and limited supply have caused shortages of these items in many stores.",
