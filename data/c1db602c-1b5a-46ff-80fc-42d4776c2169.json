  "output": "LibraTech was once a small startup but has grown exponentially over the years. The company was founded by three friends and began with a vision of creating innovative technology that would revolutionize the world. They began by focusing on creating software that would help people manage their finances in a more efficient and secure way. After gaining more traction, they hired more staff and started selling their products to larger corporations. Fast forward a few years, and LibraTech became a leader in their field, with their products and services being used by millions of people in over 50 countries. They have come a long way from where they began and are now a household name in many countries. Their success was not achieved easily, but with hard work, dedication, and the belief that they would change the world - one product at a time.",
