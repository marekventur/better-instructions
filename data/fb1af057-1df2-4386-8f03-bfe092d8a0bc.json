  "output": "Automated machine learning can be beneficial for predictive modelling as it can reduce the amount of time and effort required for model building. Automated machine learning utilizes algorithms to automate the process of feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection and provides an optimized model solution. Additionally, automated machine learning can work with a variety of data and can reduce the manual effort and errors associated with manually building and tuning traditional predictive models. Automated machine learning also helps to reduce overfitting, as it can automatically select the best model, and can quickly find the ideal hyperparameter setting.",
