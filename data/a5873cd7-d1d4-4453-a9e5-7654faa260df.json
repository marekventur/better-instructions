  "instruction": "Explain why a full moon is brighter than a crescent moon.",
  "input": "No input.",
  "output": "A full moon is brighter than a crescent moon because it is illuminated by more of the Sun's light than a crescent moon. The crescent moon is illuminated by only part of the sun, while the full moon is illuminated by the entire face of the sun, making it appear brighter. The difference is further magnified by the fact that more of the sun's light is concentrated on the face of the moon when it is completely illuminated.",
