  "input": "",
  "output": "An algorithm to determine the prime numbers up to 100 can be constructed as follows: \n\n1. Start with a list of all the numbers from 2 to 100. \n2. Set aside 1 as not a prime number. \n3. Starting with 2, divide all the other numbers by that number. \n4. Any number that is divisible (with no remainder) by the number is not a prime number and can be removed from the list. \n5. Next, move onto the next number in the list, and repeat step 3-4 until all numbers from 2 to 100 have been divided. \n6. All numbers left in the list are prime numbers.",
