  "output": "It was a wild night. The moon was bright and the stars twinkled in the sky. Suddenly, there was a rustle in the bushes and out stepped a wide array of animals; a bear, a wolves, an alligator, and more. \n\nThe animals had all come together to celebrate with a party! They ate tasty insects, fruits, and vegetables, and danced the night away with abandon. The bear sang an old folk song and the wolves howled along. Even the alligator, who normally seemed to always have a stoic expression, was tapping its feet and swaying to the music. \n\nThe animals stayed up until the sun rose, and then they said their goodbyes, each going off to lead their own lives but with memories of this one amazing night firmly in their minds.",
