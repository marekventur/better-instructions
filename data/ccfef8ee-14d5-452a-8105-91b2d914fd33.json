  "input": "",
  "output": "The process of how a bill becomes a law is complex and involves multiple steps. The process typically begins when a bill is introduced in the House of Representatives or the Senate. If the bill gets a majority vote and passes in both chambers, it is then sent to the president. If the president signs the bill, it is officially law. If the president vetoes the bill, it does not become a law unless it is passed again with a two-thirds majority in both chambers.",
