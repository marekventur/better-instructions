  "input": "",
  "output": "Model bias is a phenomenon whereby a machine learning model might consistently make the same mistake due to the algorithm\u2019s choice of assumption. Model bias can result from the use of the wrong data set and from overfitting, and is a form of systematic error that leads to wrong conclusions. Model bias is more likely to occur when the dataset used to train the model does not adequately represent the population that the model is expected to make decisions about.",
