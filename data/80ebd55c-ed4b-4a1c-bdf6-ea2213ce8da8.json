  "output": "Two obstacles to successful communication are communication style differences and lack of clarity. Communication style differences occur when two people have different ideas as to how to effectively communicate, such as one person preferring more direct conversation and the other preferring more subtle conversation, leading to miscommunication. Lack of clarity occurs when a person is not clear in their communication, leading to confusion or misinterpretation.",
