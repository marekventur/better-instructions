  "output": "The three advantages of cloud computing are scalability, cost savings, and reliability. Scalability allows companies to only use the exact amount of computing resources they need, resulting in significant cost savings. With cloud computing, businesses do not need to worry about maintaining their own servers or hardware and can focus instead on their core business operations. Cloud computing also provides highly reliable computing resources and is designed to provide consistent uptime, ensuring that data is not lost due to hardware failures.",
