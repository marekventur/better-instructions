  "output": "Max is a survivor in a post-apocalyptic world. He is strong, independent and determined to make it through the harsh environment. He has dark eyes and a sense of humor that often gets him out of tough situations. He wears an old leather jacket that has seen better days and he carries a small handgun on his person at all times. He trusts few people in this world, but he's loyal to those he does trust. Max was a wanderer before the apocalypse, but now he is a master of survival.",
