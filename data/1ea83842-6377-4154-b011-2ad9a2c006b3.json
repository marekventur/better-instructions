  "output": "Life is like a haunted house - there are surprises around every corner, and the journey can be filled with ghosts of the past and haunting memories. Some will stay along the path and confront their fears, while others will turn back and never know how far they could have gone. In the end, each person must find a way to face the unknown and make it out alive.",
