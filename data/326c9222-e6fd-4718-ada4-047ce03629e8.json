  "input": "",
  "output": "Automation has had a profound effect on job trends, as it has resulted in both the creation of new job opportunities and the loss of jobs that have become automated. Automation has created more efficient processes for a variety of tasks and businesses, which has resulted in increased productivity and cost savings. This in turn has created many new job opportunities, from robotics engineers and data scientists to operations and maintenance personnel. On the other hand, automation has resulted in the displacement of jobs that can now be done faster and more accurately by machines. This shift has required many people to acquire new skills or to switch to different job roles.",
