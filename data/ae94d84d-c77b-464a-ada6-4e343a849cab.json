  "output": "Caring for a rabbit involves providing them with a comfortable environment, ample space to roam, appropriate food and diet, protection from predators, and regular interaction. Rabbits are social creatures, so it is important to keep them in groups with other rabbits or to spend quality time with them. Their housing space should provide enough room for them to move around and have toys to play with. \n\nRabbits should be fed a proper diet of hay, fresh vegetables, and a small amount of timothy or rabbit pellets, to ensure they get the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients they need. Water should be available at all times and the food changed regularly. \n\nFinally, rabbits need to be protected from predators or other dangers, such as extreme heat or cold, as well as kept clean. Regularly grooming a rabbit can help keep their coat in good condition.",
