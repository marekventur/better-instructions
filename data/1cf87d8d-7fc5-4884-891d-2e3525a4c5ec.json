  "output": "Mitochondria are organelles found in most eukaryotic cells that generate energy for the cell in the form of ATP. They are the \"powerhouses\" of the cell and are known as the \"cellular engines\" because of their role in generating energy for the cell to use for various processes. Mitochondria use oxygen and nutrients from the cells to produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. They also play roles in other cellular processes such as signaling, apoptosis, and calcium metabolism.",
