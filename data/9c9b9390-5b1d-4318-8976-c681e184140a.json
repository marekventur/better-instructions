  "input": "",
  "output": "Standardization is a process used in machine learning models to process and scale data before training a model. It involves rescaling data such that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. This allows the data to be put on a similar scale, which can be important when training a model with data from different sources. Standardization can also be used to reduce the impact of outliers in the data.",
