  "input": "",
  "output": "The two people are in a large, echoing hall. Both of them are tense and angry, their faces and voices tense with emotion. One is gesturing wildly, while the other is shaking their head in disagreement. Several others are standing nearby, watching the argument play out but not intervening. The atmosphere is tense, and the reverberation of voices seems to fill the entire hall.",
