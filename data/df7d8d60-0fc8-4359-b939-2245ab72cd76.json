But, for all the progress that was being made, the world's citizens were still without the most important things in life. \n\nPeople were still without the courage to follow their dreams, the knowledge to heal their bodies, and the strength to make the world a better place. It seemed like the more advances that were made in technology, the further mankind felt from all of these most important things. \n\nEthan, a young man who dreamed that one day technology would finally be able to provide the answers to all of the world's struggles, decided to take action. He was determined to find a way to use technology to provide people with the courage, strength, and knowledge they lacked. So, against all odds and with the help of some of the world's greatest minds, Ethan created a powerful AI which could assist mankind in tackling their most difficult problems. \n\nThe AI was an incredible success and Ethan received global recognition for his accomplishment. He was finally able to show the world that technology could be used to gain insight into the world's most difficult problems and to provide people with the courage, strength, and knowledge they needed.",
