  "input": "",
  "output": "One creative solution for managing air pollution is to use green technology to capture and filter out pollutants. This could include the use of green roofs, which use vegetation, soil, and natural evaporation to reduce emissions. Additionally, green walls or vertical gardens could be used to absorb and filter out pollutants. Finally, air filtering systems such as air ionizers and air purifiers could be used to reduce indoor air pollution.",
