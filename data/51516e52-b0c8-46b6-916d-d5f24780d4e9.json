  "input": "The Thanksgiving Day Parade",
  "output": "The Thanksgiving Day Parade began in 1924, when Macy's employees paraded the streets of New York City holding large animals made out of paper-mache and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. The spectacle was a hit, and Macy's eventually expanded it to include clowns, floats, bands, and of course, the traditional arrival of Santa Claus. The parade continued every year, but it was suspended during World War II. It was resumed in 1945, and has since become an annual tradition.",
