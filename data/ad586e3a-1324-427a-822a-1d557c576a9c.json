  "input": "",
  "output": "The economic impact of globalization has been largely positive, as it has brought more open markets, lower costs of production, increased access to goods and services, and strengthened global economic ties. Additionally, it has increased capital flows, led to more efficient use of resources, and allowed for greater competition. However, it has also led to job losses due to outsourcing, heightened inequality among nations, and the globalization of environmental problems such as climate change.",
