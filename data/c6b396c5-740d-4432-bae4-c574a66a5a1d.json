  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change is a worldwide concern because it is impacting the environment, health, food production, and economy. The earth's temperature is already warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution due to the increasing amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. This is resulting in more extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, hurricanes and severe storms. Additionally, it is causing sea levels to rise and ocean temperatures to increase, which is harming marine life. Climate change is also causing shifts in ecosystems and posing a threat to food production, economic growth and overall human health.",
