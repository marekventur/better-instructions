  "output": "The two main theories of evolution are Lamarckism and Darwinism. Lamarckism, proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1809, states that organisms can pass acquired traits to their offspring. This is the idea of \u201cuse and disuse\u201d, where organisms modify their behavior and organs to better fit their environment, and these changes then get inherited. On the other hand, Darwinism, proposed by Charles Darwin in 1859, relies on the concept of natural selection. This theory states that organisms inherit heritable traits from their parents, and those organisms with traits best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. This leads to a gradual accumulation of beneficial traits in successive generations.\n \nBoth theories share the idea of heritability. However, the main difference lies in how traits get inherited. Lamarckism suggests that traits are actively acquired during an organism's lifetime and then passed down to offspring, while Darwinism suggests that traits are inherited from parents and random mutations can lead to variation in traits.",
