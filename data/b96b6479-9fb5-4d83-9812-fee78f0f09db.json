  "instruction": "In the context of a computer-aided recognition system, describe the differences between facial recognition and fingerprint recognition.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Facial recognition systems use high-resolution images of an individual's face to identify them, while fingerprint recognition systems use unique, individualized fingerprints to identify someone. Facial recognition is less secure than fingerprint recognition as it relies on external markers, such as glasses or makeup, which can change over time and can be replicated more easily. On the other hand, fingerprint recognition does not change over time and is much harder to replicate.",
