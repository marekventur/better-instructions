  "input": "Great Recession",
  "output": "The Great Recession caused numerous impacts to the population, ranging from increased unemployment and decreased access to health care to social unrest and political changes. Many people saw their savings and investments vaporize, leading to decreased purchasing power and a decrease in overall confidence in the economy. People in lower-income brackets were particularly affected, leading to a widening gap between rich and poor. In addition, many people were unable to pay their mortgages and lost their homes due to foreclosure. The recession also caused significant psychological distress, leading to an increase in rates of depression and anxiety.",
