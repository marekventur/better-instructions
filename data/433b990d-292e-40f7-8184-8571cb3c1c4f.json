  "output": "The main differences between coffee and tea are the type of plant used to make them. Coffee is made from coffee beans, which are the seeds of the coffee plant, and tea is made from the Camellia sinensis plant. Coffee also typically has more caffeine than tea, and coffee is usually stronger and more intense in flavor. Other differences include the ingredients used in coffee and tea-based beverages, and the way they are brewed.",
