  "output": "Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on creating algorithms to enable systems to learn from data and experiences, rather than explicit programming. Typically, machine learning algorithms analyze data and use this data to continuously improve the performance of a system. This allows machines to become better at a task without being explicitly programmed. For example, machine learning can be used to create self-driving cars, image recognition software, or to analyze large datasets. It is a powerful tool that is becoming increasingly important in modern technology.",
