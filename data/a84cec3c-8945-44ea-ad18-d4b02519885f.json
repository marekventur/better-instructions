  "output": "Eating fish has numerous potential health benefits for the human body. Fish is a nutrient-rich food source that is high in protein, vitamins, and minerals. It is also an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for a healthy heart and for reducing inflammation in the body. Studies have shown that individuals who consume fish on a regular basis may have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer. Additionally, fish contains selenium and iodine, two important minerals necessary for proper thyroid functioning. Eating fish also provides a leaner source of protein and fewer calories than other animal proteins. In summary, eating fish has numerous potential health benefits that should not be overlooked, and should be incorporated into a balanced diet.",
