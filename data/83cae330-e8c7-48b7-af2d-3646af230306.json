  "input": "Application: Patient Records Management System",
  "output": "I would develop a prototype for a Patient Records Management System, which would allow doctors and other healthcare providers to securely store, manage and share patient medical records. The prototype could include a user interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly add, view and update patient records. The prototype could include features such as a secure database for storing records, a patient-search function to locate records, and a patient-tracking system to easily monitor the progress of a patient's care. Additionally, the system could be designed so that records can be securely shared with other healthcare providers.",
