  "input": "",
  "output": "Dividend stocks are stocks that pay out a portion of the company's profits to shareholders on a regular basis. When a company earns a profit, they can either reinvest it in the company or pay it out to its shareholders. Companies that choose to pay out dividends to their shareholders can issue a dividend that is paid out on a regular basis (such as monthly, quarterly, or annually). Dividend stocks typically pay out more attractive yields than other stocks and can be an attractive investment for income-seeking investors.",
