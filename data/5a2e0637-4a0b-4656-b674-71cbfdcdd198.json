  "output": "One of the best ways to improve communication between team members is to set up regular meetings and check-ins. This helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and keeps the lines of communication open. Additionally, it is important to establish protocols for communication that are respectful and efficient. This could be adoptin a policy of active listening, or sending a follow-up email with summaries of meetings.
