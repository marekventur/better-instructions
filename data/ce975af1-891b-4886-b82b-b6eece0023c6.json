  "instruction": "Answer this programming question: What is the difference between a static and a dynamic array?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A static array is one whose size is fixed at the time of declaration, so no elements can be added or removed from it after declaration. A dynamic array, on the other hand, can grow and shrink in size during the program execution. It is implemented using pointers, so it uses more memory compared to a static array.",
