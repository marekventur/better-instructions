  "input": "",
  "output": "Coffee and tea are both popular hot beverages, but they have some distinct differences. Coffee is made from the roasted beans of the coffee plant and has a much stronger flavor than tea. It is also higher in caffeine, with a cup containing approximately 95-200 milligrams of caffeine, compared to 30-50 milligrams in a cup of tea. Tea is made from the leaves of the camellia sinensis plant and comes in many varieties, including oolong, black, and green. Tea is lower in caffeine, but contains antioxidants and other beneficial compounds that coffee does not have.",
