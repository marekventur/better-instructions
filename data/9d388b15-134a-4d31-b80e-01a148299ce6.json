  "input": "",
  "output": "A simple algorithm to create a valid Sudoku board could involve the following steps: \n1. Create an empty 9x9 grid, with all values filled in with zeros.\n2. Place the numbers 1 to 9 randomly on the edges of 3x3 sub-grids.\n3. Fill in the remaining values of the sub-grids by randomly choosing numbers from 1 to 9 that are not already present in the same row, column, or sub-grid.\n4. Repeat step 3 until all cells in the 9x9 board are filled in with valid numbers.\n5. Check if the final board is valid according to Sudoku rules and repeat the process until a valid board is produced.",
