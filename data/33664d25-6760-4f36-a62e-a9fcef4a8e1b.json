  "input": "Given two sets of numbers A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8}.",
  "output": "The relation between the set A and set B can be expressed as A X B = { (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8) }. This means that for each item in set A, there is a corresponding item in set B.",
