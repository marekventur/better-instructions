  "instruction": "Think of a design that would reduce the need for people to own cars.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One approach to reduce the need for people to own cars is to create a comprehensive, public transport system that is accessible and reliable. This could include local buses and trains, as well as shuttle services, bike- and scooter-sharing systems, car-sharing services, and microtransit services. This system should be well integrated, so that people can reliably plan and book their journey through the apps, and minimize their overall car ownership.",
