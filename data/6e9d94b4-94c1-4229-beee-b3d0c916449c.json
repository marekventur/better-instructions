  "input": "",
  "output": "Home automation technology can be used to reduce energy use and minimize environmental impact. For example, it can be used to automate thermostat settings, lights, and appliances, and it can also power down unused devices when not in use. Automation can also be used to monitor a home's energy usage and provide reports that identify when and how energy is being used. Additionally, automation can provide notifications when doors and windows are opened and closed to regulate the home's temperature and reduce energy costs. Automation can also be used to detect water leaks, inform users of power outages, and actively manage energy use to reduce overall household driving costs.",
