  "output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are both fields of computer science which involve the development of intelligent machines that can learn from data and perform tasks autonomously. AI focuses on human-like behavior and involves the development of algorithms and data structures that allow machines to learn through pattern recognition and logical reasoning. ML, on the other hand, is a subset of AI which focuses on teaching computers to optimize tasks to a certain degree of accuracy.",
