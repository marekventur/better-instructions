  "output": "To make pancakes, you will need 1 cup of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 cup of milk, 1 egg, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Start by sifting the flour, baking powder and salt together in one bowl. In a separate bowl, beat together the egg, milk, and melted butter. Then, pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Heat a skillet over medium-low heat and grease with butter. Pour about 1/4 cup of pancake batter into the hot skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the edges appear crispy. Flip and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the pancakes are golden brown. Serve with favorite toppings, such as butter, syrup, or fresh fruit.",
