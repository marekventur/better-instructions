  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had a very special pet pig named Toby. Although Toby was an ordinary pig, he was the farmer's favorite. Every morning, the farmer would bring Toby a carrot and they would have a long conversation together. \n\nOne day, the farmer forgot to bring Toby a carrot, so Toby ran up to the farmer's barn and grabbed a pitchfork. Thinking it was a carrot, he happily ran back over to the farmer and presented him with the pitchfork. The farmer was so touched by Toby's thoughtfulness that he brought him an extra-special carrot the next day to show his appreciation.",
