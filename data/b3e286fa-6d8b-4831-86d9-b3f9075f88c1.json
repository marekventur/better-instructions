  "output": "Technology can influence human behavior by shaping our habits, activities, and preferences. For example, social media algorithms can have an effect on what content we see and how long we spend on certain websites. Technology can also influence how we interact with each other, as it can reduce the need for face-to-face communication and make it easier to carry out activities such as shopping, dating, etc. without having to leave the home.",
