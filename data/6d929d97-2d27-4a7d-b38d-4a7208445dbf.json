  "input": "",
  "output": "A narrative essay tells a story and is usually focused on a particular event or person. It often contains dialogue and a sequence of events. On the other hand, a descriptive essay is focused on describing a particular object, situation, or person in detail. It usually does not contain dialogue, but rather conveys the writer's vision through more detailed and vivid language.",
