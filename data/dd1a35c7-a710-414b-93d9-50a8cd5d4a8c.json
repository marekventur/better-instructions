  "output": "Four benefits of using a GPT in natural language processing tasks include providing context-awareness, increased accuracy of predictions, faster training speeds, and increased adaptability. A GPT is able to provide context-awareness by recognizing different words and phrases that appear in different contexts and making predictions based on those contexts. GPTs can also produce more accurate predictions due to its ability to process large amounts of data. Additionally, GPTs are faster in training when compared to other methods, due to the ability to pre-train weights. Finally, GPTs can also be adapted to various tasks, allowing it to quickly be repurposed for new tasks.",
