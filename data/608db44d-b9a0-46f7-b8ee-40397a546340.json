  "instruction": "A friend of yours is considering taking a gap year before college. Write a short paragraph in which you encourage them to take the gap year.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Taking a gap year before college can be an excellent decision, as it can help to provide clarity and focus when starting your higher education journey. During a gap year, you can take the time to explore yourself and the world around you in new ways, as well as gain new skills and experiences that can be invaluable when starting college. Whether you are looking to go travel, volunteer your time, or begin a job to start amassing your own funds, a gap year can help to provide you with the opportunity for self-discovery that may not be there later on. So, if you have the chance, make sure to consider the idea of taking a gap year before college.",
