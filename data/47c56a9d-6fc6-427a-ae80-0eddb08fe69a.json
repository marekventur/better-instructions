  "input": "",
  "output": "Investing in stocks offers the potential for higher returns over the long term, but carries greater risk than investing in bonds. Bonds tend to be less volatile than stocks, and interest earned is usually fixed. Stocks, on the other hand, can generate larger returns over the long run, but investment returns can vary significantly over the short term. Furthermore, stocks can benefit from dividend income, which bondholders do not receive. Ultimately, it depends on an individual's risk tolerance and financial goals when deciding which type of investment is the better option.",
