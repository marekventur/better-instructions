  "instruction": "Develop a hypothesis to explain why a certain species of bird migrates from one region to another.",
  "input": "Migrating species of bird: Northern Bobwhite",
  "output": "My hypothesis is that the Northern Bobwhite migrate from one region to another in order to find more suitable food sources. During the summer months, there can be a scarcity of high quality food sources in their current region which may lead to a decrease in the bird's health. By migrating to new regions, the birds can find insulation from cold winters and access more abundant food sources.",
