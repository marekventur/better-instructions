  "input": "",
  "output": "The causes of World War I can be summarised in three points: the regional tensions, militarism and alliances, and imperialism. Regional tensions between nations resulted in a heightened sense of hostility and competition. Militarism and alliances among nations led to complex webs of international relations, with each nation ready to intervene in a conflict to safeguard their alliances. The continued pursuit of imperialism and the power and resources that came with it were also a major factor behind the war.",
