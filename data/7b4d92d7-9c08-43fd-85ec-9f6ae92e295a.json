  "output": "In a meadow of harmony, beauty is seen,\nSoftly shining, whispering serenity.\nA beauty of birdsong enchanted in grace,\nEnhancing the petals of a delicate daisy face.\n\nUnderneath a tree of lush ivy and leaves,\nBeauty sings its voice in a gentle breeze.\nTime stands still in this moment of bliss,\nAs beauty shimmers in a magical mist.\n\nThe sky of life is filled with tranquillity and peace,\nA beauty so pure to feel, if only in a fleeting release.\nIn this silence of life, beauty speaks so softly,\nThe whisper of its essence in every dream that one ever sees.",
