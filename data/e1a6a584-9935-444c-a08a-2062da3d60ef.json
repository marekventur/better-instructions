  "input": "",
  "output": "This algorithm takes in information about a fruit and classifies it into one of the following categories: citrus fruits, stone fruits, or berries. \n\n1. Start by asking for the texture of the fruit - is it hard and round (citrus) or soft and juicy (stone and berry)? \n2. Next, ask for the shape - is it round or oval (citrus) or square or oblong (stone)?\n3. Then, ask for the number of seeds - is it seedless (citrus) or does it contain multiple seeds (stone and berry)? \n4. Lastly, ask for the taste - is it tart or sweet (citrus) or sweet and juicy (stone and berry)? \n\nUsing this information, the algorithm can accurately classify the fruit.",
