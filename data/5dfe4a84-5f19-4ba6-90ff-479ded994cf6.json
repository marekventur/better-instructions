  "input": "",
  "output": "A GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model is a type of language modeling approach which uses a transformer-based neural network architecture to generate natural language from a given input. GPT models are trained using large amounts of data and a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, summarization, and more. GPT models can generate text for different tasks such as open-ended generation, classification, question-answering, and more.",
