  "output": "My native country is India and one of the unique dishes here is Thalipeeth. It is a flatbread made from a mix of rice flour and wheat flour, flavored with spices and crushed vegetables or sesame seeds. The dough is spread out in a thin circle and cooked on a tawa or griddle until crisp. Thalipeeth tastes delicious with a dollop of butter and yogurt.",
