  "input": "",
  "output": "Three examples of edge computing are intelligent traffic control systems, autonomous vehicles, and mobile phones. Intelligent traffic control systems use edge computing to process traffic data in real-time and optimize traffic flow. Autonomous vehicles use edge computing to process in real-time the data from sensory devices and make decisions in a safe manner. Mobile phones use edge computing to process data locally and provide faster response times to the user.",
