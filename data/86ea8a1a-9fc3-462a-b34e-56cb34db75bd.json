  "output": "Magnetic force and gravity are both significant forces in the universe. Gravity is an attractive force that acts between any two objects with mass, while magnetic force is the attracting and repelling of magnetic materials and charges. Gravity is relatively weaker than magnetic force, and acts over larger distances in comparison to magnetic force. Gravity is an ever-present force, while magnetic force requires a magnetic field created by a magnet or an electric current to induce an effect. Gravity is always attractive, while magnetic force can be both attracted and repulsed, depending on the orientation of the objects.",
