  "instruction": "Design a program to respond to user queries",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The program should contain a user interface that enables users to input their queries and receive a response. It should also have an underlying algorithm that can process the user's query and respond appropriately. The program should use natural language processing and other AI techniques to recognize the user's intent and match it with a suitable response. If the program is unable to recognize the user's query, it should also be able to suggest related questions that the user can explore.",
