  "input": "",
  "output": "Public transportation helps decrease air pollution by reducing the number of cars on the road and the amount of emissions they produce. Mass transit vehicles such as trains and buses emit fewer pollutants than individual cars, and they are more efficient in terms of fuel usage. Public transportation also encourages people to decrease the amount of time they spend in their cars, which decreases the amount of fuel used. Additionally, by consolidating passengers into fewer cars, public transportation reduces traffic congestion which also decreases the amount of pollution created by cars.",
