  "instruction": "List the main theme of the article.",
  "input": "This article provides an exploration of the implications of noise, both externally-introduced to a system, and internally-generated within a system, on collective intelligence. It is argued that external noise can drive a precarious collective intelligence system towards either order or chaos via \u2018phase transitions\u2019. Decomposition of external noise in terms of regime control and critical control is discussed as possible mechanisms for phase transitions. Internal noise is discussed with respect to the question: \u201cHow resilient is a collective intelligence system against internal noise?\u201d Distinguishing between noise-supported and noise-stabilized collective intelligence systems concludes the article.",
  "output": "The main theme of the article is the implications of noise on collective intelligence, with external noise potentially driving a collective intelligence system towards either order or chaos via \u2018phase transitions\u2019, and internal noise being discussed with respect to the resilience of a collective intelligence system.",
