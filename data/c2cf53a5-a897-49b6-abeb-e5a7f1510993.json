  "output": "The use of Augmented Reality (AR) in education has the potential to revolutionize the way students learn. AR provides a more immersive and engaging learning experience as it allows students to visualize concepts and bring abstract theoretical concepts to life. It also bridges the gap between virtual and real learning, as well as allowing students to explore topics in-depth. Furthermore, it promotes collaboration, encourages creative thinking and problem-solving, and facilitates deeper understanding of complex concepts.",
