  "input": "",
  "output": "Trustworthiness can be evaluated in various ways, such as asking references from previous employers, examining a candidate's background and qualifications, and conducting psychometric tests to measure traits such as integrity and honesty. Qualities like reliability and dependability can also be assessed through assessments such as interviews and reference checks. Additionally, employers can ask potential candidates to take a short survey which will give them an idea of how trustworthy the candidate is.
