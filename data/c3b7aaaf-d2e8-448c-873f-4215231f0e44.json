  "output": "A GPT model is useful for generating text because it utilizes unsupervised machine learning methods to generate human-like text which closely models the style and context of data provided. It is capable of producing text that is grammatically sound while incorporating key concepts from the data. It is also efficient and easy to use, making it a popular tool for natural language processing applications.",
