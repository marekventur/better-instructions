  "instruction": "Given a budget of 50$, design a day trip for a family of 4 to a nearby destination.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "For our day trip, we would rent a car to get there since it's nearby. We would pack a delicious picnic lunch to take with us and bring blankets and games for the car ride. We could visit the local park and go on a nature walk through some of the trails, and have lunch there. Afterward, we could visit a nearby heritage site or museum that the family can explore together. We could end the day with a treat like ice cream or cake, and the total cost would be under 50$.",
