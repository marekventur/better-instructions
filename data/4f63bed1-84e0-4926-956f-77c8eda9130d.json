  "output": "John had always been an inquisitive person and he was always looking for adventure. He stumbled across a mysterious map which had a single destination noted on it. The destination was an ancient temple, located deep in the jungle, and it was said to be magical and powerful. He had to go.\n\nJohn started his journey, full of anticipation and excitement. After many days of travel, he finally reached his destination. Instead of an ancient temple, he found a modern-day laboratory. Here, he discovered the \"map\" was just a research experiment. He had not discovered a mysterious temple at all, but a scientific accomplishment instead.",
