  "input": "Alex had been studying for weeks for his big math test. He was nervous, but he felt confident that he'd ace it. As the test began, he became increasingly anxious. He started to doubt himself and got more and more confused as he went on. He was sure he'd fail, but he kept on trying.",
  "output": "Alex had been studying for the past two months in preparation for his big math test. He had barely slept in that time, devoting every spare second to studying the subject. Although he was well-prepared in his head, he found himself feeling more and more nervous as his test day approached.\n\nThe day of the test, Alex woke up feeling completely exhausted despite being well-rested. He forced himself to walk to the testing center and took a seat in the exam room just as his name was called. As the test progressed, he found himself increasingly anxious, feeling like he was in way over his head. He struggled to recall facts and formulas, doubting himself more and more with every question. He felt sure he was going to fail, but he kept on trying, never wanting to give up hope. \n\nAs the test ended, Alex felt a wave of relief wash over him, knowing that he had done his best. He made his way back home, determined to do better next time and hoping for the best.",
