  "input": "",
  "output": "Photovoltaics are a type of energy-generating technology that can help reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by providing a source of clean, renewable energy. Photovoltaics convert sunlight into electricity, which can be used to replace electricity from fossil fuels. This reduces the use of fossil fuels and the resulting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In addition, photovoltaics are easy to install, require minimal maintenance, and are relatively cost-efficient, making them an attractive alternative energy source.",
