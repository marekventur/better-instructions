  "output": "Sustainable energy is energy obtained from sources which cannot be exhausted and is renewable. These sources include solar energy, wind energy, biomass energy, geothermal energy, and waves from the ocean. Sustainable energy provides an abundance of energy and is not damaging to the environment. It also leads to a decreased need to rely on depleting resources as well as a reduced amount of waste and emissions. \n\nUsing sustainable energy saves a lot of money in the long run since it is not being produced and thus fossil fuels are no longer needed. Renewable energy is particularly useful in areas where there is a lack of access to traditional energy sources and in areas where conventional energy sources cause damage to the environment, such as coastal areas and areas with large amounts of forestry.\n\nSustainable energy helps reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and thus helps mitigate climate change. It is much more efficient than traditional energy sources and does not have the large setup costs associated with them. Additionally, it does not require large amounts of land for installation and allows for much of the energy and resources to be used locally, which helps to create jobs and stimulate local economies. \n\nOverall, sustainable energy is incredibly important for saving money, protecting the environment, and providing a healthy and prosperous future for all.",
