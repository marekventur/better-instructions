  "input": "Sleeping Giant",
  "output": "The phrase \u201cSleeping Giant\u201d is often used to refer to a large entity which has remained dormant for a long period, but is capable of enormous impact when it awakens. It's most commonly used to describe a country, organization, or industry, but it can be used in any context. It implies that the entity, however inactive it may seem at first glance, has an immense amount of potential which has yet to be tapped. Its store of potential is likened to a giant who is merely sleeping and can, once awoken, have a powerful, game-changing influence on its surroundings.",
