  "instruction": "Create a storyboard to explain the history of the USA.",
  "input": "No Input",
  "output": "A storyboard to explain the history of the USA would need to begin with the Native Americans who first populated the country. This would be followed by the arrival of European settlers and their various struggles to create and defend their colonies. The American Revolution, the formation of the United States and the Civil War are all important events which shaped the nation. The storyboard should then discuss the Industrial Revolution which transformed the country, followed by the World Wars and their influence on the USA's global power. The second half of the 20th century saw the rise of the civil rights movement and the subsequent changes it brought, as well as the Cold War and its impact on the US. Finally, the storyboard should end with the present day, including some of the current issues the nation is facing.",
