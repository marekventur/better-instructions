  "output": "A family woke up early in the morning to take on the tasks of their farm. The sun was slowly rising and the roosters were singing in the distance. The children were given responsibilities like feeding the animals, gathering eggs, and plucking vegetables from the garden. As the day progressed, everyone came together to milk the cows, tend the garden, and make sure the animals were happy and healthy. As the day grew longer, so did the family's work. After the dusk settled in, the family worked together to make a delicious dinner from the that day's bounty and enjoyed it under the night sky.",
