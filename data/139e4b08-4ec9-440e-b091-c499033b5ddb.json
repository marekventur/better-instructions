  "input": "",
  "output": "One way of measuring a person\u2019s reaction time is through a simple experiment. To do this, you will need a stopwatch or timer and a few small objects like paper clips. Start the timer and ask the subject to pick up a paper clip as soon as they hear the timer sound. When the subject picks up the paper clip, stop the timer and note the amount of time that has elapsed. This will give you an indication of how quickly the subject reacted to the sound. The experiment can also be done with other small objects like buttons, coins or beads to measure the subject\u2019s reaction times to different stimuli.",
