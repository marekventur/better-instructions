  "input": "",
  "output": "Capital gains taxes are taxes levied on the profits from the sale of assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate and other investments. Capital gains are calculated as the difference between the purchase price and the sale price, and the rate of taxation is determined by the individual's income tax bracket. In the case of long-term investments, the IRS classifies profits that are held for more than one year as long-term capital gains and are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.",
