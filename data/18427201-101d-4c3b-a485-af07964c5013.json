  "input": "",
  "output": "A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical product, process, or system. These digital twins use real-time data from sensors to create a dynamic, up-to-date digital representation of an object in the physical world. This data is used to monitor performance, spot trends, and detect anomalies to improve operational efficiency and reduce maintenance costs.",
