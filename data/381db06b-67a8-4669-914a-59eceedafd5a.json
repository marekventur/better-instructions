  "input": "",
  "output": "My algorithm for classifying emails into spam and not-spam consists of the following steps: \n1. Preprocessing: Clean the emails by removing punctuation and stopwords. \n2. Feature Extraction: Extract text features such as bag of words, part-of-speech tags, and sentiment analysis. \n3. Classification: Train a machine learning model on the processed emails to be able to distinguish between spam and not-spam emails. \n4. Post-processing: Evaluate the model\u2019s performance on unseen emails to check its accuracy.",
