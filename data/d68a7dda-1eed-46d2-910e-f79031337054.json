  "output": "An algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem can be expressed as follows:\n\n1. Move the n disks from the starting tower to the auxiliary tower, one at a time, using the final tower as the spare\n\n2. Move the nth disk from the auxiliary tower to the final tower\n\n3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the final tower, one at a time, using the starting tower as the spare\n\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all disks are moved from the starting tower to the final tower",
