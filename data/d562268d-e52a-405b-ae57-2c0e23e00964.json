  "output": "The purpose of a null hypothesis in a statistical test is to state a hypothesis that will be tested and rejected if there is enough evidence that the null hypothesis is false. In other words, the null hypothesis is a hypothesis about a population parameter which is tested with data from a sample. If there is enough evidence against the null hypothesis, then the alternative hypothesis must be true.",
