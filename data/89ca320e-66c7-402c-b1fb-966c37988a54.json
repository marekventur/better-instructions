  "instruction": "What are the living conditions like in Antarctica? Output a 3-5 sentence response.",
  "input": "No input",
  "output": "Living conditions in Antarctica are primitive compared to more temperate regions. Most scientists who work there live in simple shelters or research stations. These have basic amenities like running water and electricity, and some even have internet access. In extreme temperatures, any life outside the buildings is short lived. Conditions are harsh with low oxygen levels, lack of fresh water, and food that must be flown in. Communicating with the outside world is challenging due to the remoteness of Antarctica.",
