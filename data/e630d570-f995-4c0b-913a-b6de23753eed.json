  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the common strengths of GPT models is their ability to generate natural language text with minimal supervision. With the right pre-trained models, GPT models are able to generate fluid and logical sequences of text that mimic the natural language found in text written by humans. Furthermore, GPT models can generate entire paragraphs from just a single seed sentence.",
