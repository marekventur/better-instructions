  "input": "",
  "output": "Nuclear and solar energy are both sources of clean, renewable energy and can help to meet our energy needs while minimizing environmental impacts. Nuclear energy requires a large capital investment to build and maintain a nuclear power plant, but produces more energy at a lower cost than solar. Solar energy is more affordable, but may require a large upfront investment in infrastructure and panels. Nuclear energy is generally thought to be more reliable than solar in terms of consistent electricity production, while solar energy relies on weather conditions in order to produce. Additionally, nuclear energy produces much higher levels of radioactive waste that must be safely disposed whereas solar energy produces little to no waste.",
