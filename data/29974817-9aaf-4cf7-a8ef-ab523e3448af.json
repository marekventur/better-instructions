  "output": "The sun warms my face in England's green fields, \nReplete with life and songs heard from afar; \nThis place is full of peace and charm,\nIt gives me the courage to look towards the stars.\n\nThe crystal-clear sky and meadows so lush,\nWith wildflowers dancing merrily in the wind; \nThe serene beauty of every bush,\nMakes me forget all my worries and my sin.\n\nIn this charming and meandering landscape,\nLife has its own enchanted tale; \nI can feel my heart thump in \nAn appreciation of life\u2019s prodigal detail.\n\nThere's an unexplainable peace in that place,\nMaking me appreciate all life can bring; \nThis place will always be embedded in my grace,\nA pure haven that's waiting for my return in the spring.",
