  "output": "The three primary components of a neural network are the input layer, one or more hidden layers, and the output layer. The input layer receives the input data, which is then processed by the hidden layers and finally produces an output from the output layer. The hidden layers use artificial neurons which consists of weights, biases and an activation function to process the inputs.",
