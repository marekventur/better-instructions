  "instruction": "Create a mechanism that would allow a robot to move around a 2D environment.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A robot moving around a 2D environment would need to use kinematics, which is the analysis of motion without considering the forces involved. The robot would need to employ mechanical structures that allow it to move in a variety of directions, with sensors to detect obstacles and provide positional feedback. Additionally, the robot would need to have a source of power, such as batteries, in order to power its motors.",
