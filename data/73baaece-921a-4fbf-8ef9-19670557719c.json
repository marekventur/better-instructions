  "instruction": "Describe the electric car conversion process.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An electric car conversion process involves removing the combustion engine and fuel system of an internal combustion engine (ICE) powered car, and replacing it with an electric motor and a battery pack. The motor usually connects to the existing transmission of the car, allowing the car to still be driven. The battery pack is typically comprised of several smaller energy storage cells, usually lithium-ion, and is usually located under the car's hood or somewhere in the rear of the car. Other components such as a DC-DC converter, motor controller and throttle may also be added.",
