  "instruction": "Explain the relationship between wavelength and frequency in terms of electromagnetic radiation.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is inversely proportional to its frequency. In other words, the higher the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, the shorter the wavelength and vice-versa. Wavelength is measured in meters and frequency is measured in hertz (Hz). For example, a 2GHz signal has a wavelength of 0.15 meters (15cm).",
