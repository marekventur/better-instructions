  "instruction": "Design an experiment to support the given argument",
  "input": "That smiling can make people happier",
  "output": "One experiment to test this argument would involve selecting two groups of participants. The control group would keep their regular facial expression, while the experimental group would be instructed to smile throughout the experiment. The participants would then be asked to answer a series of questions about their moods. If the experimental group reports higher levels of happiness than the control group, this would support the argument that smiling can make people happier.",
