  "output": "The effects of climate change on marine ecosystems are wide-ranging and complex. This paper seeks to examine the current scientific research and evidence available to better understand the implications of increasing global temperatures on marine species and the ecosystems they inhabit. Temperature change has a direct and indirect impact on species migration, the growth and decline of certain species, and increasingly complex food web relations. Additionally, acidification and sea level rise can greatly affect the health of marine ecosystems, both in the short and long term. Our research examines the current findings in the scientific literature and offers analysis of these conclusions to provide insight into the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems.",
