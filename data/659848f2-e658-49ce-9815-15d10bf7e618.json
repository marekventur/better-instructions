  "input": "",
  "output": "A modern operating system typically consists of several components, including a kernel, a user interface, file system, device drivers, and system libraries. The kernel is the core of the operating system and handles the memory, process and task management, and the communication between hardware and software components. The user interface provides the means for users to interact with the operating system, such as via a graphical user interface (GUI). The file system organizes and stores data, allowing users to access and modify files. Device drivers provide an interface between the operating system and external hardware. Finally, system libraries provide functions allowing programs to interact with the operating system and hardware resources.",
