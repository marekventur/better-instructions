  "output": "An artificial limb, or prosthetic, is a device designed to replace a missing limb or body part. Prosthetics are designed to improve mobility, reduce pain, and increase independence for those who have lost a limb. Prosthetics are custom-made for the individual user and can be made from a variety of materials, including plastics, metals, and composites. Artificial limbs can be motorized or non-motorized, and can include an array of sensors, motors, and computers to control the movements of the limb.",
