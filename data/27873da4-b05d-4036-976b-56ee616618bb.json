  "input": "",
  "output": "Soaring in a dream of fog, \nMy sorrows drift in the endless distance. \nThe fog surrounds me, concealing all my pain, \nAllowing me to dream of better days ahead. \nWhat was real is fading into the fog, \nMy sorrow a distant memory of what it once was. \nForgetting my pain, I dream of the future, \nMy sorrow melting away, hidden in the fog.",
