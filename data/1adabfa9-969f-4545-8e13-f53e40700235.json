  "output": "A custom color palette for this website design could include muted reddish browns and creamy whites. These colors create a cozy, natural feel that would fit nicely with the photo of the mountain range in the background. The reddish browns can be used to accentuate the mountain range while the creamy whites lift and lighten the design.",
