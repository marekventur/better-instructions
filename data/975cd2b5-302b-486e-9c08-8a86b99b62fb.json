  "input": "",
  "output": "The main steps for writing an essay are researching the topic, deciding on a thesis statement, creating an outline, writing the essay, and revising the essay until it meets the desired standards. During the research phase, it is important to compile reliable sources, such as articles written by experts in the subject area. After researching, you should decide on a thesis statement and then build an outline around that statement. The essay should include an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The introduction should introduce the topic, thesis statement, and provide a preview of the essay. The body paragraphs should contain evidence to back up the thesis statement. Finally, the conclusion should be a summary of the essay and should include a restatement of the thesis statement. Once the essay is written, it should be carefully revised to ensure it is free of grammar and spelling errors.",
