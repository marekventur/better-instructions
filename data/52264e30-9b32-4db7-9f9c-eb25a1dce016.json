  "output": "A situation where using a formative assessment is more beneficial than using a summative assessment is in the classroom. Formative assessments give teachers the opportunity to measure student understanding in real time, allowing them to adjust instruction as needed. This can be useful for checking student comprehension of difficult concepts, determining if students are ready to move on to the next topic, or identifying areas where students may need additional support. On the other hand, summative assessments are typically used to measure student mastery of skills at the conclusion of a unit or course, rather than providing feedback during the learning process.",
