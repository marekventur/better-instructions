  "input": "",
  "output": "Infectious diseases are spread by contact with infected individuals, contact with their bodily fluids, or contact with contaminated surfaces and objects. They can be spread by direct contact (such as touching, kissing, or sexual contact) or indirect contact (such as through the air, food, water, or vector animals, such as mosquitoes). Infectious diseases can also spread when people do not take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of the disease, such as frequent hand-washing and avoiding contact with people who have the disease.",
