  "input": "Technology: Robotics",
  "output": "A potential use case for robotics is in factory automation. Robotics technology can be used in industrial settings to automate labor-intensive tasks. Robots are able to move quickly and accurately and follow instructions precisely. This allows them to take on tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming, difficult, or unsafe for humans. Additionally, robots can be programmed to detect and report anomalies, ensuring more consistent and higher-quality end products.",
