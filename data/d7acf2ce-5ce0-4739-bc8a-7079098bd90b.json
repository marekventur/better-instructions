  "input": "",
  "output": "A web application is an application that is hosted on a web server and accessed through a web browser. A native application is an application that has been designed to run on a specific operating system or platform, such as iOS, Android or Windows. A web application can run on any platform as long as it has a web browser, while a native application must be specifically designed and coded for the platform it is to run on. Furthermore, web applications can update quickly across multiple platforms and devices, while native applications require separate updates for each unique platform and device.",
