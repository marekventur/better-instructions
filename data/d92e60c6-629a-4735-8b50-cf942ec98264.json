  "output": "Dogs and cats are both domestic pets, but they have quite a few differences. Dogs are typically larger and need more exercise. They\u2019re also more energetic and tend to be more outgoing. Cats, on the other hand, require less exercise and can be more independent. They are also more content to stay indoors and don't need as much attention from their owners.",
