  "input": "People should always forecast the best outcome, regardless of the situation.",
  "output": "I don't agree with that statement. While it is important to stay positive and look for the best possible outcome, it is also important to acknowledge that sometimes things won't turn out the way we hope. Being realistic is important so you don't get too caught up in the expectations and be realistic about the possibility that the result may be different than planned.",
