  "output": "Deep in the forest, there was a small village tucked away. Most of its inhabitants were foresters, and each of them were proud of their craft. \nOne night, beneath the light of a full moon, a strange creature appeared in the village. It had a wolf-like appearance but its eyes glowed like the stars. The creature seemed to be made of shifting moonlight and the villagers were both intimidated and captivated by it.\n\nThe children rushed out of their homes to see the strange beast, excited and scared. Despite their fear, none of the villagers dared to approach the creature. They stayed at a safe distance, observing its movements and trying to understand why it had come to the village.\n\nThe creature paced around the village, its movements hypnotizing. When the sun rose, it vanished as quickly as it had appeared.\n\nThe villagers were perplexed and none of them knew what to make of their experience. But one thing was for sure: They would never forget the creature that came out one night under the full moon.",
