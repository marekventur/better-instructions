  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that deals with analyzing and understanding human language. It can involve tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis and more. Natural language understanding (NLU) is a more complex branch of AI where AI systems are able to understand more complex concepts such as context, meaning and intent in human communication. Natural language understanding is a prerequisite for achieving a broader range of tasks, such as voice-to-text and text-to-voice conversion.",
