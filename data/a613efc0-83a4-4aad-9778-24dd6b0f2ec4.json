  "output": "A type I error is a false positive, when a hypothesis test results in the rejection of a true null hypothesis. A type II error is a false negative, when a hypothesis test fails to reject a false null hypothesis. In other words, a type I error is when a test incorrectly identifies an event as significant, while a type II error is when a test fails to identify an event as significant when it is.",
