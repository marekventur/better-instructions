  "instruction": "Explain the difference between 'critical thinking' and 'analytical thinking'",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Critical thinking involves questioning, reasoning, and analyzing all the facts and evidence of an issue, in order to form an opinion or judgement. It often involves weighing up pros and cons, recognizing any underlying biases, and making sure that all evidence is taken into account. Analytical thinking takes the approach of breaking down complex tasks into more manageable components, with the aim of making the process easier to understand and solve. Analytical thinking often involves the use of logical reasoning to compare, contrast and interpret data or evidence, in order to reach conclusions or solutions. It often attempts to identify causes and effects and understand the way in which they are related.",
