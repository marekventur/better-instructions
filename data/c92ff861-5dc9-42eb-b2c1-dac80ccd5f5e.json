  "input": "",
  "output": "Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology which allows for secure and immutable data storage and recording. It records information in a decentralized and distributed manner, meaning that data is not held in one single location and is viewable to all users on the blockchain. This means that data is more secure, as any malicious changes will be visible to all users. Additionally, data is immutable, meaning that once it is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be changed or deleted. This makes it more secure and reliable than other storage methods.",
