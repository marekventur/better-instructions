  "output": "Adam was never one to follow the crowd. He spent a lot of time travelling and exploring the world, meeting people from all walks of life. He\u2019d often find himself getting caught up in adventures, discovering places that he never knew existed. \n\nOne such journey took him to a small town in Michigan, just off the beaten path. Here, he met a kindhearted individual named Bob. Bob shared with Adam a story about a strange creature living in the woods nearby.\n\nAdam had heard a lot of tall tales before, but something told him Bob was being serious. Without hesitation, he followed Bob into the woods and soon came across a giant fire-breathing dragon! 'My word, how did I miss this!' he thought.\n\nAdam quickly decided that the dragon could use his help, so he did his best to protect it from the local hunters and poachers. With his help, the dragon was able to stay safe and eventually grow enough in size to take flight, disappearing into the horizon.\n\nAdam never forgot the dragon, or his adventure with Bob. Like all great discoveries, it changed him in ways words couldn't describe.",
