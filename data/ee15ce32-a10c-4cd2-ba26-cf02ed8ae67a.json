  "input": "Couple disagreeing on how to celebrate their anniversary.",
  "output": "The couple should talk openly about what each of them would like to do for their anniversary. They should try to plan something that accommodates both of their desires. Compromise and understanding can be essential to resolving any relationship issue. For example, if one person wants to go out for the evening and the other wants to stay in and watch a movie, they could find a restaurant with a home theater and do both. It is important for the couple to share their feelings about the occasion, and to remember what the day is really about\u2014celebrating the love they share.",
