  "input": "",
  "output": "In mathematics, subtraction is the process of taking away or subtracting one value from another. When 6 is subtracted from 3, the result is 3. This is because 6 is 3 units larger than 3, so 3 units must be taken away from 6 to make the numbers equal.  Therefore, 6 - 3 = 3.",
