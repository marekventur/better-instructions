Raffaello D\u2019Andrea is credited with developing balancing robots, known as \u201cquadrotors\u201d, while Rodney Brooks developed what is now known as the \"subsumption\" architecture. Koichi Suzumori developed the \u201cKansei\u201d or industrial revolution style of robotics, which enables robots to build complex physical structures from component parts.",
