  "input": "",
  "output": "When using natural language processing or machine learning algorithms to solve problems, understanding the context is key. For example, when training a chatbot, understanding context could be necessary when a customer is asking a question that could have multiple interpretations. For instance, if a customer says \"I want to order a large pizza\", without understanding the context, the chatbot may not be able to correctly identify what type of pizza the customer wants. With context, the chatbot can infer that the customer is referring to size.",
