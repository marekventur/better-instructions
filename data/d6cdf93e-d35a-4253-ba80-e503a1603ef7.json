  "output": "The typical lifestyle of a farmer in the United States is generally that of hard physical labor, with long hours and often difficult working conditions. They spend their days tending to their crops and animals, as well as performing a variety of necessary maintenance tasks. They often live in rural areas, with limited access to services and amenities. Farmers also often must manage their own financial and business matters, from filing taxes to marketing and running sales.",
