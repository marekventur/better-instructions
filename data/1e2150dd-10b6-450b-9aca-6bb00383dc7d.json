  "output": "Mrs. Wells is a 73-year-old retired teacher who loves to read in her spare time. She is stoic yet gentle, with a penchant for nostalgia; her wise grey eyes often glimmer with childhood memories that no longer exist. Mrs. Wells is wise beyond her years, with a wealth of knowledge that she loves to impart on her three grown children. Even in her retirement, she is still a teacher at heart and loves nothing more than to share her wisdom with those around her.",
