  "output": "Francesca was walking around her backyard one day when she spotted something strange. She squinted her eyes and saw an old stone wall covered in vines. Intrigued, she decided to explore and found a path leading to a clearing in the woods.\n\nAs she emerged from the woods, she gasped in disbelief: it was an entire city, forgotten and buried deep in foliage. It looked very different from modern cities, with cobblestone roads and small stone houses, but so fascinatingly beautiful.\n\nShe continued to explore the city, and soon discovered it was filled with a variety of fascinating sights, from an old fountain in the center of town to a library filled with books. In one corner of town, Francesca found an old statue of a woman looking out into the horizon with a wistful expression. \n\nFrancesca stayed in the city until it was dark, when she reluctantly returned home. She was amazed to find a hidden city so close to her home, and wondered how long it had been forgotten and what stories it held.\n\nEvery day, Francesca would go back to explore more of the forgotten city and its mysteries, and she found solace in the ancient beauty of this hidden place.",
