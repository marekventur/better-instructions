  "input": "",
  "output": "The optimal time to launch a product to maximize sales depends on multiple factors, such as the market that the product is targeting and the seasonality of demand. Generally speaking, launching the product at the beginning of a season or before a holiday or special event can help to maximize sales. Launching the product right after a product announcement can also help to build excitement and draw new customers. Additionally, ensuring that the product is launched with a strong marketing campaign can help to create visibility and drive sales.",
