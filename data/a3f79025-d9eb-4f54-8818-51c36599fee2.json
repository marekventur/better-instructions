  "input": "",
  "output": "Static webpages are comprised of pre-written HTML code and do not change content or layout based on user input. This makes them faster to load and less resource intensive. Dynamic webpages, on the other hand, are generated from a database on the server and are based on user input or interaction, which makes them slower to load but more interactive. Static webpages also require more manual updating, whereas dynamic webpages can be changed with ease.",
