  "input": "",
  "output": "Elephants and dolphins are both mammals from different habitats. Elephants are the largest land mammals and live on land, while dolphins are sea mammals and live in water. Elephants are herbivores, while dolphins are predators and scavengers. Elephants have large curved tusks and trunks, while dolphins have fins and blowholes. Elephants communicate primarily through sound, while dolphins communicate through clicks and whistle-like sounds. While both are intelligent and social animals, dolphins are more interactive and playful while elephants are more solitary and serious.",
