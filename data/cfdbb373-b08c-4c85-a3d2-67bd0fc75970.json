  "input": "",
  "output": "An example of an algorithmic fairness problem is when a loan application system uses an algorithm to assess a person's creditworthiness. The algorithm might use job history and employment data to judge the creditworthiness of an applicant, even though that data is only indirectly related to their ability to pay back the loan. By treating different types of job experience differently, the algorithm could be introducing bias into the system, disadvantaging some applicants on the basis of their profession.",
