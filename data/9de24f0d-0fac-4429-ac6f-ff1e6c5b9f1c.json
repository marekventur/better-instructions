  "input": "",
  "output": "AI can help improve healthcare by streamlining processes such as medical diagnosis, treatment and imaging. AI algorithms can be trained to analyse medical records, and detect signs of abnormalities or diseases based on objective criteria, thus reducing the need for manual inspections. AI can also be used in the areas of medical imaging, drug development and precision medicine. For example, AI can be used to identify patterns in medical imaging to detect and diagnose diseases in a more accurate and efficient way. Additionally, AI can help improve decision making for diagnosis and treatment through machine learning techniques. Finally, AI can provide useful insights for drug development by predicting how certain drugs/treatments will affect specific patient types and provide more personalized care.",
