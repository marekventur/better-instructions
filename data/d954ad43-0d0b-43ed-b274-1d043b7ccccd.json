  "input": "",
  "output": "At an online store, a GPT model was used to provide personalized product recommendations to customers. By analyzing customer preferences using the GPT model, the store was able to generate tailored product suggestions for each individual customer, based on their past browsing history and purchase patterns. This improved the customer experience, as customers were able to find products more quickly and find items that fit their needs. The store also saw an increase in sales, as customers were able to find items that they otherwise wouldn't have been exposed to.",
