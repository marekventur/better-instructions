  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a volcano and an earthquake is that a volcano is the result of magma and gases building up beneath the surface of the Earth and then erupting, while an earthquake is the result of a sudden release of energy from within the Earth's crust. Volcanic activity typically involves the direct eruption of volcanic material, while earthquakes mainly involve vibrations of the earth's surface. Volcanoes are usually limited to areas around the Earth's mantle and crust, while earthquakes can occur anywhere in the Earth's interior.",
