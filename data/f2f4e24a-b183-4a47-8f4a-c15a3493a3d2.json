  "output": "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model where users access virtualized computing resources that are managed by a cloud provider. IaaS enables users to access, provision, and manage their own computing resources and handle the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networks. Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model where users access the provider's platform to develop, run, and manage applications. In a PaaS model, the cloud provider is responsible for managing the underlying infrastructure while users manage and customize the applications. Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model where users access the provider's applications over the internet. In a SaaS model, all the underlying infrastructure, platform, and software applications are managed by the cloud provider, and users access and use the applications as needed.",
