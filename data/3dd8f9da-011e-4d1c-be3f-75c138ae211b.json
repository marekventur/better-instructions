  "instruction": "Explain how air resistance affects the motion of a falling object.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Air resistance is a force which occurs when a moving object collides with the molecules in the air. Air resistance affects the motion of a falling object by slowing down its momentum and decreasing its acceleration. The force of air resistance increases as an object moves faster and as the object becomes larger, making it more difficult for the object to fall. This means that objects with greater mass, like a rock, fall slower than an object with lesser mass, such as a feather.",
