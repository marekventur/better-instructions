  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary difference between float and double data types is their size and precision. A float is a single-precision, 32-bit floating-point data type that has 7 decimal digits of precision. A double is a double-precision, 64-bit floating-point data type that has 15-16 decimal digits of precision.\n\nFloat takes up less memory and that is why it is generally preferred if memory is a concern. However, double offers more precise values, so if accuracy is a concern, double should be used.",
