  "output": "Mrs. Smith had been living in the same small town for most of her life and now at the ripe old age of ninety, she decided it was time to do something new. After seeing her neighbor\u2019s flourishing garden, she decided to start one of her own. She had never done anything like this before, but she was not afraid of a challenge. With help from her family and her community, she was soon able to create a beautiful small garden in her backyard with various plants and flowers. She found joy in tending to her garden, and it soon became a source of comfort for her.",
