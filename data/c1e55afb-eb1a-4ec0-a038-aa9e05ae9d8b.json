  "instruction": "How is a backprop algorithm used in deep learning?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A backprop algorithm is used in deep learning to calculate the gradients of a neural network by propagating the error from the output layer back to the input layer. It adjusts the weights of the neural network layers by using the gradients calculated from the error to update the weights. This allows the neural network to learn and improve its accuracy over time.",
