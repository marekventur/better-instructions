  "output": "A method to manage stress during work is to practice mindful breathing exercises. Taking deep, diaphragmatic breaths helps to activate the body's natural relaxation response and reduce the levels of stress hormones in the body. Mindful meditation can also be helpful as it helps to bring awareness to thoughts and encourages people to focus on the present moment instead of worrying about the future. Additionally, taking regular breaks during work and engaging in physical activities such as walking, jogging and yoga can also be effective in reducing stress.",
