  "input": "",
  "output": "Frogs do not have external eyelids; instead they have a transparent layer of skin called the nictitating membrane which covers the eye and protects it while still allowing the frog to see. This membrane is located at the corner of the eye and is moved by tiny muscles. Therefore, frogs have no external pairs of eyelids.",
