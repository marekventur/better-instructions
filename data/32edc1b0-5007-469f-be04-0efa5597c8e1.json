  "output": "This creature has a lion's head, a reptilian snake's body, and gecko's legs. Its eyes are fierce and it has a forked tongue that darts out of its mouth. It is feared by all, with its combination of sharp teeth, venomous fangs, and razor-like claws. It is able to scale walls with its gecko-like legs, and is swift and agile on the ground. Despite its fierce appearance, it is an incredibly powerful yet graceful being.",
