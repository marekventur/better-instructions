  "output": "Natural selection is the process by which organisms evolve due to differences in heritable traits, allowing them to better adapt to their environment. Artificial selection is the process by which humans select organisms with certain desired traits in order to breed them and create outcomes that serve their interests. Both processes result in change in the genetic makeup of the organisms, but only artificial selection is guided by human decisions.",
