  "output": "When I was in high school, I was part of a robotics team and we had a particularly difficult problem to solve during our competition. After brainstorming for hours, we hit a roadblock. Finally, someone suggested we use a pack of gum to connect two of our components together. After some trial and error, we were able to make the connection and our robot worked perfectly! It was a great experience in creative problem solving and team work.",
