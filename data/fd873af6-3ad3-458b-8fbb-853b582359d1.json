  "output": "Two theories of how the universe began are the Big Bang Theory and the Steady State Theory. The Big Bang Theory states that the universe began with a single, infinitely dense point that expanded rapidly, eventually forming the stars and galaxies that are seen today. The Steady State Theory states that the universe has always existed and continues to expand at a steady, unchanging rate.",
