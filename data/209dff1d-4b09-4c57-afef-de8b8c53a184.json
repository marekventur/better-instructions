  "input": "",
  "output": "For a fun birthday celebration, here are three ideas to try:\n\n1. Create a DIY Bouncy Castle - Create an inflatable playground with a few bouncing balls and some kiddie pools filled with water.\n\n2. Create a \"Mystery Room\" game - Set up a room with clues hidden around for the kids to find, giving them clues until they can solve the mystery and find the \"treasure\".\n\n3. Host a theme-based Minute to Win It competition - Start with simple challenges such as stacking cups and moving ping pong balls between bowls until the time runs out.\n\nNo matter which activity you choose, your 12-year-old and their friends will have a blast!",
