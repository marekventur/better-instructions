  "output": "A typical day of school for a college student usually starts early in the morning with classes, lectures or labs. After that, they may have study group meetings or office hours to attend, followed by lunch and some free time. This could be spent studying, catching up on coursework or getting ahead on upcoming assignments. In the afternoon, there may be more classes or seminars and after dinner, college students often spend their evenings either studying or attending extracurricular activities, such as clubs or sporting events.",
