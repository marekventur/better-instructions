  "output": "The beauty of nature paints my eyes\nThe way the trees whisper the wind's sighs\nThe rolling hills mix with the sky so blue\nIn awe, I stand and wonder what nature could do\n\nThe life of wildlife gives hope anew\nLetting us know in nature, all things are few\nI don't need gold and silver to be happy\nWhen I take a walk around, I can't help but be sappy\n\nI bask in the beauty of nature's stir\nRivers, forests, and meadows, together we blur\nThe birds soaring above make me feel lighter\nAs the sun sets, I am mesmerized even brighter\n\nNature is the beauty I never ignore\nThe world is bigger and I'm so much more\nConnected by the love of the beauty of nature\nIt's a treasure so precious and a sight to remember.",
