  "input": "",
  "output": "Scientists classify animals into different species, genera, families, orders, classes, phyla and kingdoms. They use the five kingdom system to classify animals. In this system, animals are divided into Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera. The Animalia kingdom is further divided into different classes such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insects. The class is then broken down into orders, each order is divided into families, each family is divided into Genera and finally into species. Scientists also use morphological characteristics, anatomy, physiology, genetics, embryology and behavior to distinguish between animal species.",
