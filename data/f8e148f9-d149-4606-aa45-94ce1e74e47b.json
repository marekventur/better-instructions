  "output": "In Alfred Lord Tennyson\u2019s poem, 'The Lady of Shallot', a character curses her fate when she must remain hidden away in her tower, weaving a tapestry depicting the world outside which she can only witness through a mirror. Despite her enchantments, she begins to see the world directly and falls for the knight Sir Lancelot, whom she follows until she sees their reflection in the river, leading to her death. The poem is an exploration of the consequences of breaking the limitations of the physical world, ultimately reminding us of the importance of being mindful of the boundaries that enable us to live in harmony.",
