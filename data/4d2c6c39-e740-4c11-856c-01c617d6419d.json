  "input": "Baseball and Softball",
  "output": "Baseball and softball are similar sports in that they both involve hitting a ball with a bat, and then running around a diamond-shaped playing field. However, they differ in terms of the size and weight of the balls used, the pitching method, the distance between the bases, and other small details. Baseballs are bigger and heavier than softballs, and are pitched overhand. Softballs are smaller and lighter than baseballs and are pitched underhand. The distance between the bases in baseball is greater than that in softball and there are other rules differences as well.",
