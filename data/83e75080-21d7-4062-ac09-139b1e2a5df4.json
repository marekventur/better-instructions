  "instruction": "Cite a benefit of using modern deep learning architectures",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One benefit of using modern deep learning architectures is the ability to incorporate multiple layers of neurons, enabling them to learn complex nonlinear relationships that are difficult or impossible to constrain with traditional programming architecture. Additionally, modern deep learning architectures allow for the use of large datasets, which can be used to model complex problems, leading to improved accuracy and performance.",
