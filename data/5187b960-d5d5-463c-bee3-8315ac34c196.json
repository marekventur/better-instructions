One day, she gathered up her courage and decided to take a stroll in the forest. She was about to give up because she was too scared, when a magical butterfly appeared and urged her to keep going. She continued on her path and eventually made it to the beautiful meadow at the other side of the forest. She looked around and realized how much beauty and adventure she had been missing out on due to her fear. She learned that day that being brave is always worth it, and she was never afraid again.",
