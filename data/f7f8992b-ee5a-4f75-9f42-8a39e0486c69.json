  "output": "John was an engineer with a vision. He knew that he could make the world a better place if he could just find the right solution. After years of research, he finally made a major breakthrough. He had discovered a new form of energy! Unfortunately, the cost to develop his discovery was high, and the only way to fund the project was to find investors. However, the big corporations didn't believe in his project, so John had to find ways to raise the money on his own. After months of hard work, John managed to build a prototype and attract investors. Slowly, his invention was released to the world. His invention eventually changed the world for the better, and he is now remembered as a pioneer in renewable energy.",
