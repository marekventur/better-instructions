  "output": "The GCD algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor between two numbers.\n\nThe GCD algorithm works by taking two non-zero integers and repeatedly dividing out their largest common divisor until no common divisor is found.\n1. Initialize two positive integers n1,n2 such that n1 > n2\n2. Divide n1 by n2 and obtain the remainder.\n3. If the reminder is 0, then GCD (n1, n2) = (n2).\n4. If the remainder is not 0, set n1 = n2 and n2 = reminder.\n5. Repeat until the reminder is 0.\n\nWith our integers 284, 252:\nn1 = 284 and n2 = 252\n284 % 252 = 32  (remainder)\nn1 = 252 and n2 = 32\n252 % 32 = 0  (remainder)\nGCD (284, 252) = 32",
