  "input": "",
  "output": "I believe that animals should not be kept in zoos for a variety of reasons. For one, animals that are kept in zoos are often removed from their natural habitats, where they have evolved over millennia to survive and thrive. Zoos also do not provide a suitable environment for the animals, who are often unable to freely roam within the confines of the zoo and may be subject to stress-inducing overcrowding and a lack of enrichment. Furthermore, animals kept in captivity are deprived of the companionship and social interaction of their fellow species members, as living in isolation often causes psychological distress.",
