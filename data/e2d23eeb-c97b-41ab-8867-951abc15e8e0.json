  "output": "The Light Sussex is a popular breed of chicken. It is a dual purpose bird, meaning that it can be used for both meat and egg production. It has a respectable size compared to other chicken breeds, can lay up to 280 eggs per year, and is able to mature quickly in order to begin laying. The feathers of a Light Sussex are usually a mixture of brown and white, and they take on a golden hue in the sunlight. The birds have yellow legs and beaks and are quite docile, making them an excellent choice for a backyard flock.",
