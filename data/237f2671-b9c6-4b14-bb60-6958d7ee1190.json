  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural language processing (NLP) can be used to improve search engine results by recognizing user intent, understanding the nuances of language, and providing more accurate search results. NLP can analyze the structure and meaning of a query to understand user intent, create better search indexes, and provide more sophisticated search capabilities such as natural language query expansion and semantic search. NLP can also identify relationships between terms, allowing for more relevant search results.",
