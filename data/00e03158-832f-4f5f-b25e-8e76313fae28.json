  "input": "",
  "output": "Pruning a decision tree is an important step in machine learning. Pruning helps reduce the complexity of the tree and eliminates redundant branches. This improves the generalization of a model as it removes the overfitting of the data. Pruning also improves the accuracy of the model increases its efficiency and reduces the computational time.",
