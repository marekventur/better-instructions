  "output": "Magnetic levitation (maglev) is a technology that uses magnets to suspend an object in midair without any mechanical or physical support. It is largely used in transportation, to provide frictionless motion, however, it has many other applications. The technology uses a combination of powerful electromagnets and careful direction of an object\u2019s magnetic field to suspend and propel the object.",
