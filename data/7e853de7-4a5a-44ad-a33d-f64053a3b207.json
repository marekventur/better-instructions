  "output": "A latent variable is a variable that is not directly observed, but can be inferred from other variables. It is believed to have underlying causes or influencing factors that affect the observed data. An example of a latent variable is intelligence, which cannot be measured directly, but can be inferred from a variety of behaviors, such as standardized test scores, academic performance, and other measures of success. In statistics, latent variables are often used to explain the relationships between different variables, such as in regression analysis.",
