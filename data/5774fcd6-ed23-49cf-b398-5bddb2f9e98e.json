  "input": "",
  "output": "The purpose of a virtual assistant is to provide convenient, automated services that would otherwise need to be done manually. These services range from providing customers with information to managing scheduling, from providing simple answers to complex questions. Not only do virtual assistants provide convenience, but they are also generally more cost effective than employing an assistant. Virtual assistants also provide an added layer of flexibility, as they can be provided remotely and accessed from anywhere.",
