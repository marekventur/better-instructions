  "output": "The lyrics of the song \"We Are the Champions\" by Queen describe the victorious feeling of coming out of hardship and achieving success. The song is an empowering anthem of self-confidence and determination, with the title line of the song being repeated throughout and being the narrative climax of the song. The lyrics express the idea that even when faced with the greatest of adversities, with the right attitude and determination, one can come out victorious and be \"the champions of the world\".
