  "output": "One recent example of how AI has been used to improve an existing product or service is by Amazon\u2019s Alexa AI voice assistant. Amazon\u2019s Alexa has become increasingly popular due to its ability to answer questions, set reminders, control home automation, and even play music. Alexa\u2019s AI capabilities allow it to learn from past interactions and provide more personalized advice and recommendations. Additionally, Amazon has recently unveiled a new Alexa Skill called 'Follow-Up Mode', which allows Alexa to recognize when users are referring back to a previous conversation and provide relevant results with no need for further prompting or repeating the previous command. This new feature is designed to make interacting with Alexa more natural and efficient.",
