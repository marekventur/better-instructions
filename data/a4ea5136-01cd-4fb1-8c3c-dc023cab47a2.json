  "output": "Launching a rocket into space is a complex process. First, a spacecraft is assembled on the ground and then attached to a rocket. After that, the rocket is fueled with propellant, and then it is moved to a launch pad or other launch facility. The launch facility is usually located near the equator so that the rocket can benefit from the Earth's rotation. Then, the rocket is stabilized, the countdown is initiated, and the rocket is launched. After launch, the rocket is guided by automated navigation systems, and the spacecraft\u2019s engines continually make adjustments to the rocket's trajectory to ensure a successful mission.",
