  "input": "",
  "output": "A potential cause of climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The emissions of these gases trap heat in the atmosphere, which can lead to global warming. Other potential causes of climate change include deforestation, which can disrupt the natural systems that help regulate the climate, and the burning of fossil fuels, which can create air pollutants that trap heat.",
