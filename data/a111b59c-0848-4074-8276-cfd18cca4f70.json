His journey had been full of adventure, but nothing had seemed to match the thrill of discovering this mysterious cave.\n\nThe wizard had heard stories of the cave since he was a child, but he never believed it to be real until he stumbled upon it this morning. As he entered the mouth of the cave, he couldn't help but be filled with wonder; the walls glowed with a strange light, and strange artifacts filled the shelves along the walls. He moved forward with excitement, not knowing what secrets lay deeper in the cave. His find was sure to bring his fame and fortune, he was sure of it. With newfound enthusiasm, the wizard set forth into the cave, ready to explore its secrets.",
