  "input": "",
  "output": "Primary sources are direct source materials that provide first-hand evidence or testimony about a particular event or other matters of interest. Examples of primary sources include photographs, letters, diaries, novels, and interviews. \n\nSecondary sources are materials that provide information or analysis based on primary sources. Examples of secondary sources include textbooks, biographies, and critiques of literature, music, or art. Secondary sources are typically produced by someone who is not an eyewitness to the event they are describing. Furthermore, secondary sources often present information that has been filtered through the analysis and interpretation of the author.",
