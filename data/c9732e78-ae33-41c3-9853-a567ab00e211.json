  "input": "",
  "output": "Having a balanced life is essential for a professional to stay motivated, productive, and creative. When one works in a hectic or unstructured environment, it leads to burnout and fatigue, which then affects both the individual's work results and long-term success. Having a balanced life provides one with necessary rest, a better perspective on what is important, and greater creative powers that help one stay ahead of the competition.",
