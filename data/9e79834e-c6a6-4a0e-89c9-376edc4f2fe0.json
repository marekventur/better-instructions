  "input": "",
  "output": "Facial recognition technology uses algorithms to scan and analyze a person\u2019s facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth. These algorithms are programmed to recognize a certain set of facial features which then helps the system to accurately identify a person. The facial recognition technology then compares the scanned facial features with a database of images in order to match them and identify a person. It can be used for various applications such as verifying a person\u2019s identity or providing access to a restricted area.",
