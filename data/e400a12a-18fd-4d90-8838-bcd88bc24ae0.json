  "input": "",
  "output": "One measure to reduce potential spillover effects of a policy is to partner with other countries, organizations, or corporations to ensure that the effects of the policy are limited to the intended target. Additionally, careful monitoring of the policy\u2019s activities should be done in order to watch for any unintended effects. Other measures might include making adjustments to the policy in response to any potential spillover effects that arise, or increasing education and awareness around the policy to ensure it is implemented in the right way.",
