  "input": "Game industry",
  "output": "The game industry has experienced tremendous growth over the years due to a number of factors. One of the most prominent factors is the rise of digital distribution platforms, such as Steam and the App Store, which make it easier for developers to get their games to market. This has made the game industry more accessible for new developers, which has led to a larger variety of games and genres being available. Additionally, the increasing power of home computers and consoles have made it possible for developers to create games with a much higher level of sophistication and complexity. Finally, the rise of online gaming services has made it easier for people to play together online, creating more opportunities for studios to generate revenue. All of these factors have contributed to the success of the game industry.",
