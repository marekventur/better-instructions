  "output": "Cross-validation is a type of model evaluation technique which is used to assess how well a model is performing. It is commonly used in machine learning and statistics to estimate the skill of a model on unseen data. It involves splitting the data into k-folds (usually 5 or 10) and each fold is tested using a different combination of the features from the training set. This helps to identify the most accurate combination of features and avoids overfitting the model. Cross-validation allows for a more accurate prediction of the model performance on unseen test data, which is why it is important for ensuring a higher quality and accuracy of the model.",
