  "instruction": "Determine which of the following sorting algorithms best suits this data set",
  "input": "Data set -> [67, 32, 53, 88, 88, 88, 24, 48]",
  "output": "The sorting algorithm that would best suit this data set is Counting Sort. Counting sort is a stable sorting algorithm which operates in linear time, meaning that it is a good choice for sorting datasets that have a limited range of values. In the example data set given, the range of values is between 24 and 88, making it a good fit for Counting Sort.",
