  "instruction": "Construct a linear regression model to predict sales.",
  "input": "The dataset contains data on product prices and customer demographics.",
  "output": "The linear regression model should be constructed to predict the sales of a product by taking into account product prices and customer demographics. The model should be built with the data provided and then evaluated with an appropriate metric such as accuracy or mean-squared error. Next, the model should be optimized by tuning hyperparameters to maximize the evaluation metric.",
