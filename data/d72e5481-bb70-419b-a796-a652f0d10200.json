  "input": "",
  "output": "In the traditional classroom, students learn in a physical environment, interacting with a teacher and their peers in person. In the digital classroom, students participate in an online learning environment, using technology such as computers, tablets, and smartphones to access course materials, submit assignments, and interact with their teacher and peers. The digital classroom offers a more flexible approach to learning, allowing students to access materials from anywhere, anytime. Additionally, digital classrooms often offer more interactive tools, such as forums and chat rooms, which can lead to more meaningful engagement.",
