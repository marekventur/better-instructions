  "input": "",
  "output": "Price elasticity of demand is a concept that measures how responsive the demand for a good or service is when the price changes. It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demanded by the percentage change in price. If the quantity demanded is proportional to the change in price, then the price elasticity of demand is 1. If the quantity demanded is more responsive to the change in price than the percentage change in price, then the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1. If the quantity demanded is less responsive to the change in price, then the price elasticity of demand is less than 1.",
