  "input": "Topic: Animal Testing\nArgument: Against",
  "output": "Animal testing is an unethical practice that should be stopped. Animals are sentient creatures that feel pain and suffer just as humans do and should be treated with respect and compassion. Testing on animals has been proven to be ineffective, too, as results cannot be accurately extrapolated to humans and the safety of new products. Furthermore, countless non-animal testing methods have been developed that have been shown to be more humane and more reliable. For these reasons and many more, animal testing needs to be stopped.",
