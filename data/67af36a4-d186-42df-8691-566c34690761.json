  "input": "",
  "output": "My plan to make it on time to this important meeting is to start getting ready earlier, plan for any potential traffic delays, and leave for the meeting with enough time to spare. I will double check my route and leave at least 30 minutes before the meeting starts. If I am running late, I will call the organizer and tell them I am on my way. I will take the necessary public transport or alternates way of transport to make it in time.",
