It is also used to prevent heart attacks and strokes. \n\nThe most common side effects of aspirin include stomach irritation, indigestion, nausea and vomiting. Less common but more severe side effects include bleeding, heartburn and allergic reactions. Aspirin can also cause constipation, diarrhea and drowsiness. \n\nIn terms of effectiveness, aspirin is generally considered to be an effective pain reliever and anti-inflammatory agent. In some cases, aspirin may also be used as a preventative treatment for heart attacks and strokes.
