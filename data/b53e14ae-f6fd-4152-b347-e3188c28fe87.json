  "input": "",
  "output": "Data science could help to reduce waste in a manufacturing plant by analyzing the processes used to produce items, locating inefficiencies in the system, and streamlining the production process. Additionally, data science could analyze the output of manufacturing processes to spot defects and other problems in order to minimize waste of defective products and materials. Further, data science could be used to forecast changes in demand and accurately produce the amount of each product or material needed, thus reducing the need for excess production that would ultimately result in wasted resources.",
