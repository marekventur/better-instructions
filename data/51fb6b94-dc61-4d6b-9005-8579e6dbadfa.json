It was an urban school with a diverse student population, creating an atmosphere of learning and exploration. There were numerous extracurricular activities to get involved in and experienced teachers to learn from. The school had a strong sense of community, with many events and activities taking place both inside and outside the classroom. I look back fondly at my time there and consider it one of the keys to my successes later in life.",
