  "output": "I was embarrassed when I realized I had made a mistake. It was a lesson learned I won't forget. I went out to meet my friends and had to check a couple of items off of my to-do list before meeting them. I had always been careful not to forget anything, double- and triple-checking everything had become a routine. This time, however, I had made a miscalculation and skipped an important step. I was so ashamed that all I wanted to do was to go home and hide in my bed, never to be seen again. Fortunately, I am a quick learner and I learned from my mistake. Now I make sure I triple-check everything, no matter how trivial it may seem.",
