  "input": "",
  "output": "A bridge is built by first determining the location of the bridge and then making a design plan. Next, soil is excavated from the location to create a foundation and footings. After that, the necessary structural elements such as piers, columns, and abutments are constructed. Then, steel and concrete are poured to create the deck and strengthen the structure. Finally, roadways, railings, and any additional features are added before the bridge is declared open.",
