  "input": "<no input>",
  "output": "GPT models are still heavily studied and developed today because they are extremely effective at generating natural language based on input data. They are also capable of quickly learning new concepts and generating new ideas. This makes them very useful for tasks such as natural language processing, text summarization, conversational AI, and many other applications.",
