  "input": "",
  "output": "Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is characterized by a dark, dystopian tone. It paints a picture of a future society that values conformity and control over individuality and critical thought. This oppressive atmosphere is reflected in the language as well as the bleak imagery and themes of the book. The tone is further highlighted by Ray Bradbury\u2019s use of alliteration, puns, and poetic devices.",
