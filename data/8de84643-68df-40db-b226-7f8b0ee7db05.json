  "instruction": "Explain the differences between an open-ended and a close-ended question.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Open-ended questions do not have a fixed answer, allowing the respondent to provide any kind of answer. These questions usually begin with words such as \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d \u201cwhy,\u201d or \u201cdescribe\u201d. They can generate a lot of valuable insights. On the other hand, close-ended questions can be answered with a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, or with a fixed selection of responses. These questions often begin with \u201cdo\u201d, \u201care\u201d, or \u201cwould\u201d. They are useful for collecting quantitative data, but not for gathering qualitative information.",
