  "input": "",
  "output": "The most effective method for repressing negative thoughts is to first recognize them and take a step back to observe and be conscious of the thoughts. By recognizing the thoughts as transitory, we can then replace them with more positive thoughts, or even distract ourselves with activities such as listening to music or engaging in important tasks. Additionally, mindfulness-based activities such as yoga and meditation can be practiced to relax the mind and refocus on the present moment. Finally, counseling and therapy have been proven to be highly effective in helping individuals manage and cope with negative thoughts.",
