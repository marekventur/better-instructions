  "output": "The moral of the story \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\" is that lying and crying wolf when there is no danger will inevitably lead to negative consequences. In the story, the boy's lies were ignored when he finally cried wolf in an actual emergency, leading to the sheep being eaten by the wolf. This story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of lying or exaggerating for attention.",
