  "output": "A way to classify different coffee drinks is by variety. This includes espresso-based drinks, brewed coffee drinks, and other coffee varieties such as cold brew, iced coffee, and nitro coffee. The drinks can also be classified by additives like milk, syrup, and other flavoring ingredients. Some drinks can also be classified by methods of preparation, such as French press, pour-over, and cold drip.",
