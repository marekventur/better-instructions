  "output": "The protagonist of The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield, is an intelligent, yet highly flawed and troubled young man. Holden is an individualist with a mature outlook on life, but is also immature, impulsive and disconnected from most aspects of the world. He is fiercely independent and rebels against the culture of his upbringing, yet still bitterly yearns for it. He is an outsider who struggles to understand and fit into the world, making him a sympathetic character.",
