  "input": "",
  "output": "Realistic fiction stories typically have characters and settings that feel believable, but they are not based on real-life people or events. They often draw upon the events and characters of our everyday lives and get the reader to relate to the story. The focus is often on a particular issue or theme that the author wishes to explore. The story should also incorporate elements of suspense and conflict to keep readers on the edge of their seats, and should use vivid descriptions to help readers imagine the scenes.",
