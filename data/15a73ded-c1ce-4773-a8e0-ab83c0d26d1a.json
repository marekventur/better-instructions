  "input": "",
  "output": "The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon by which the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the sun's radiation, preventing it from escaping back into space. This trapped radiation warms the Earth's surface, which in turn warms the atmosphere. This added atmospheric warmth is known as the greenhouse effect and is essential in maintaining the Earth's climate and maintaining life on the planet.",
