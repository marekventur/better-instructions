  "output": "The current political situation in India is volatile and uncertain due to the upcoming general elections. With the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2013led government in power since 2014, India has seen many major changes in public policies and laws, including the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, changes in labor laws, and stray incidents of violence. The issues of economic recession and unemployment have not been adequately addressed, while agrarian distress and lack of adequate social welfare have been constantly challenged. The political climate has become increasingly polarized as parties have engaged in provocative campaigns to attract voters. With the elections just weeks away, the political landscape in India is rife with uncertainty. How the next government will shape India's political, economic, and social life remains to be seen.",
