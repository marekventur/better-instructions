  "instruction": "Propose components for a customized AI solution.",
  "input": "Solution: AI-Powered Image Recognition System",
  "output": "A customized AI solution for an image recognition system should include several components. The first is a feature extraction layer, which will be responsible for extracting relevant features from the images. This could involve using convolutional neural networks to detect patterns and objects in the images. The next component would be a model training layer, which will be responsible for training a model on the extracted features. This could involve using supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms depending on the task. Additionally, the system should have an inference layer, which will be responsible for making predictions or classifications based on the trained model. Finally, the solution should include a user interface layer to make the system easy to use and access.",
