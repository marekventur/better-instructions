  "output": "Hydropower is the process of generating energy from the force of moving water. It uses the pressure from flowing streams or rivers, and diverts water from those sources into water turbines which transform the kinetic energy into mechanical energy. This mechanical energy is further converted into electrical energy which can be used for many applications.",
