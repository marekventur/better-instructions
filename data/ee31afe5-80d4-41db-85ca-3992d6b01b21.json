  "output": "I recently worked on a data science project to analyze the behaviors of users on social media. I used a variety of machine learning models and clustering algorithms to identify user interest and preferred media content. Through this project, I developed an algorithm to detect and analyze user preferences, content preferences and engagement with their target audience. By taking these insights, the company was able to better understand the behaviors of their target market and drive more meaningful actionable insights.",
