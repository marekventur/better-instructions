  "output": "The most ambitious project I ever undertaken was my Masters thesis. The project was to identify and analyze the factors influencing progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It involved extensive research, data analysis and the development of a recommendation framework for improving progress in the SDGs. The project spanned six months, during which I worked closely with a project advisor and a research team to develop the project. The final outcome was a comprehensive report and lecture on the project, as well as a published paper, which was reviewed and published in an academic journal.",
