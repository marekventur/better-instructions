  "output": "The sun is setting in the sky,\nA beautiful colors painting by\nThe rays that spill from Heaven's door,\nBringing nightfall from beyond the shore.\n\nThe stars begin to twinkle bright\nAbove the trees, scattered throughout the night\nThey flicker like a silent dance,\nA peaceful moment in its trance. \n\nA chorus of crickets sing a lullaby,\nTo every creature that roams the sky\nThe night brings a blanket of peace,\nA serene landscape in its bring. \n\nThe sun is setting in the sky,\nSpilling colors in the night,\nBringing peaceful moments that can bring,\nA solace of the day that will soon be gone.",
