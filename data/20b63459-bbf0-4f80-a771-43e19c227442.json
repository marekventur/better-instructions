  "output": "A quick and tasty healthy snack is air-fried banana chips. To make them, preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Slice 2-3 bananas into thin slices, place in a single layer in the air fryer basket, and spray lightly with oil. Cook for 5-7 minutes, flipping the slices halfway through. Sprinkle with cinnamon or nutmeg for an added flavor kick. Enjoy!",
