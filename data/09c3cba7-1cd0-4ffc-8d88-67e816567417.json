  "instruction": "Create a program to predict whether an email is spam given its text.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "I would create a program that takes in the text of an email and outputs a binary result (1 for spam and 0 for not spam). The program would use natural language processing to preprocess the text of the email and extract features from it. Then, it would use a supervised learning algorithm (e.g. logistic regression or SVM) to train a model on the extracted features. The model would be able to predict whether a given email is spam or not. The program would have a built-in accuracy metric to measure the performance of the model. The program should be designed so that it can be periodically updated with new data to further enhance its performance.",
