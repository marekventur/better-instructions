As they continued, they soon opened a door that seemed to magically open and found themselves in a wondrous kingdom filled with magical creatures and exotic lands. They quickly discovered that they were the chosen ones to save the Kingdom from an evil spell and embarked on a magical adventure filled with trials and tribulations in order to save the Kingdom.
