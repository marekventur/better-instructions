  "instruction": "Formulate a hypothesis about the relation between income and happiness",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The hypothesis is that there is a correlation between income and happiness, meaning that higher income is associated with greater levels of happiness. This is likely due to the fact that higher income leads to greater access to resources that can increase a person's sense of well-being, such as improved health care, better education, and increased leisure activities. Additionally, higher income generally corresponds to greater security and stability, which can increase overall feelings of contentment.",
