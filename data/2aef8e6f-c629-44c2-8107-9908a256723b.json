  "input": "",
  "output": "Friedrich Nietzche and Jean-Paul Sartre both argued for the freedom of the individual, though Nietzsche believed in a more deterministic version, believing that it was an innate power we have from birth. Sartre however, believed in an eschatological perspective where meaning can exist in a changing world and our freedom is tied to our action and responsibility. Both thinkers argued that man has the capacity to make his own choices, however, Sartre believed in a more universalistic approach, believing in a general humanistic ethical system, while Nietzche believed that each individual should determine the right way to live on their own.",
