  "input": "<noinput>.",
  "output": "Modern art is an important part of art history because it marks a transition from traditional subjects and techniques to new subjects and techniques. Modern art presented new ways of representing reality, relying less on mimetic approaches, and more on abstractions, symbols, and experimentation. It has also encouraged contemporary artists to explore new and innovative ways of expressing their ideas which in turn has influenced not only art, but other aspects of culture, such as music, film, and literature.",
