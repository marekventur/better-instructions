  "output": "The leaves are falling, leaves of autumn gold,\nA gentle breeze, a chill that blows,\nThe sun that slowly sets, before night comes to fold,\nA season of beauty, with dreams to behold.\n\nThe days grow shorter, the sky turns gray,\nThe land it sighs as summer slips away,\nOrange, yellow, and crimson begin to display,\nBringing in a vibrant beauty, during this time of day.\n\nThe winds blow cold, as Frost begins to bite,\nThe air whispers, chill and full of fright,\nIt is the season of change, and so we all must write,\nThe story of our lives, in the midst of this night.",
