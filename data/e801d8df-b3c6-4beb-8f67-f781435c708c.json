  "input": "",
  "output": "You can use Microsoft Excel to calculate odds by first entering the number of success outcomes and number of failure outcomes. Then, the formula \"=SUMPRODUCT(FACT(A1:A2);B1:B2)/FACT(SUM(A1:A2))\" should be entered into the cell, where A1:A2 contains the success outcomes and B1:B2 contains the failure outcomes. This formula will provide the odds of success or failure.",
