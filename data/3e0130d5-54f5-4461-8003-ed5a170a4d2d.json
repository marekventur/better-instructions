  "output": "To make a pizza from scratch, start by mixing together the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Then, add the warm water and mix with your hands until a soft dough is formed. Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and knead for five minutes. Place the dough into a oiled bowl, cover it, and let it rise in a warm place for 45 minutes. After rising, roll out the dough and transfer it to a lightly greased baking sheet. Add your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings, then bake in the oven at 375\u00b0F for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Enjoy!",
