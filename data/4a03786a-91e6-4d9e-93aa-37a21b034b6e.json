  "output": "One technology that has had a significant impact in the last five years is artificial intelligence (AI). AI technology has made it possible for computers to complete tasks that were traditionally completed by humans, such as recognizing images, making decisions, and providing natural language processing. AI technology is also being applied to automation and robotics, leading to faster processing, reduced costs, and improved accuracy and efficiency. Other applications of AI include healthcare, facial recognition, autonomous cars, and financial services. AI is quickly becoming an integral part of everyday life, and its impact will only continue to increase in the future.",
