  "input": "",
  "output": "Inequality in the US poses a significant problem as it can lead to poverty, social and economic strife, and a lack of opportunity and mobility. It has been found that inequality can lead to increased rates of crime, poor educational outcomes, poor health outcomes, and the perpetuation of generational cycles of poverty. In order to combat this, it is important to reduce barriers to economic mobility, create and provide more access to educational opportunities, and address the structural issues and policies that contribute to inequality.",
