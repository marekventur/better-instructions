  "input": "",
  "output": "The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales are both scales used to measure temperature, but their scales are different. The Fahrenheit scale is based on 32 degrees for the freezing point of water and 212 degrees for its boiling point. The Celsius scale is based on 0 degrees for the freezing point of water and 100 degrees for its boiling point. Another difference is that the Fahrenheit scale has 180 degrees between the freezing and boiling points of water, while the Celsius scale has 100 degrees between these two points.",
