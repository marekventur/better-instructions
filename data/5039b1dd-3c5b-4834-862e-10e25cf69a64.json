  "input": "",
  "output": "The Earth revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit, which means it moves in an oval shape rather than a perfect circle. This orbit takes 365.26 days to complete, or one year. The Earth's axis is slightly tilted, which causes the seasons to change from summer to winter. The tilt of the axis also causes the Earth to move closer and further from the Sun, leading to variations in temperature throughout the year.",
