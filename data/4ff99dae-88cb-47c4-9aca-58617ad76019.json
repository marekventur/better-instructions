  "input": "",
  "output": "The three methods to reuse plastic are recycling, upcycling, and repurposing. Recycling involves breaking down plastic items into smaller pieces and creating new items from them. Upcycling, also known as creative reuse, involves transforming existing plastic items into a new, more valuable item. Repurposing involves giving a new use to an existing plastic item. Examples of repurposing include using plastic containers as planters and reusing plastic bottles as bird feeders.",
