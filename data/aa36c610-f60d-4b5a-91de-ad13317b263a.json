  "instruction": "Explain the limitations of using GPT models compared to other types of natural language processing models.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "GPT models are based on a probabilistic approach to language modeling and are less accurate than models based on supervised learning. They are also limited in that they cannot generate novel or creative content, as they rely heavily on existing training data and follow the patterns found within it. Furthermore, GPT models can only generate short output, which makes them unsuitable for longer tasks such as summarization. Finally, because of their reliance on existing training data, GPT models tends to generate stereotypical or generic responses, as opposed to being able to generate creative and unique output.",
