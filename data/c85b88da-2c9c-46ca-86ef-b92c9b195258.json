  "output": "The human digestive system works by breaking down food into smaller particles that can be absorbed by the body. The process begins in the mouth, where saliva and enzymes break down food into smaller pieces. The food then passes through the esophagus to the stomach, where stomach acid and more enzymes break down the food further. Finally the food enters the small intestine, where the nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream and the remaining waste material passes out of the body.",
