  "input": "",
  "output": "The first industrial use of computers dates back to the 1950s when computers began to be used increasingly for automatic control of production processes. This was followed by the development of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing systems in the late 1960s, which further increased the reliance of industry on computers. In the 1970s, the computer was incorporated into a wide range of products, from industrial robots to air traffic control systems. By the end of the 20th century, computers had become a fundamental part of industrial production in almost every sector.",
