  "input": "",
  "output": "An employee assistance program (EAP) can help create a more positive work environment by providing training and education on managing personal and/or work-related stressors. Such programs can help employees better manage their day-to-day stressors and provide tools to prevent issues related to mental health, substance abuse, and work/life balance. Additionally, an EAP can provide access to confidential counseling and guidance, creating a supportive and understanding atmosphere. Finally, an EAP can provide guidance to employers on best practices for creating a healthier workplace.",
