  "output": "A web server is a computer program that provides services over the internet. It receives requests from clients, processes them, and then returns the appropriate response. The main job of a web server is to serve webpages to users. A server can host a website, respond to requests for information, and process data from the user. Web servers can also be used for other applications, such as streaming media and application hosting. Web servers can be deployed as a part of a cloud computing system, allowing for more efficient resource management and scalability.",
