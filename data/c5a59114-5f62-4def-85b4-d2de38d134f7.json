  "input": "",
  "output": "The temperate forest biome experiences four distinct seasons--spring, summer, autumn, and winter. During the spring, the weather is typically warm, rainy, and mild. The summer brings hot temperatures and plenty of sunshine. The fall brings cooler temperatures and increased precipitation. Lastly, the winter is typically cold and rainy. \n\nThe vegetation in these forests is also largely influenced by the change in seasons. Many plants and animals will flourish in the spring, while some may go dormant in the summer or winter.",
