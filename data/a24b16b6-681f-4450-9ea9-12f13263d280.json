  "input": "",
  "output": "In Emma by Jane Austen, characters like Miss Bates, Mr. Woodhouse, and Mr. Elton exhibit comic relief throughout the novel. Miss Bates is portrayed as a talkative and chatterbox who is often made the butt of jokes, while Mr. Woodhouse is an overly anxious character who always has a fear of the smallest of ailments. Mr. Elton, on the other hand, is a clumsy and pompous individual who is often ridiculed for his silly attempts at courtship.",
