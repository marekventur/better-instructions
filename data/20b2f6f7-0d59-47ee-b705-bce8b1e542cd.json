  "instruction": "Review the given essay. Give me a thorough summary.",
  "input": "The essay is about how teachers and school administrators can work together to create a safe and respectful school environment for students.",
  "output": "Schools should provide a safe and respectful environment for students by actively involving teachers, administrators, and other stakeholders in creating a culture of trust and respect. Teachers should help create a positive school climate by engaging students in meaningful conversations and valuing their opinions, while administrators should act as role models and respond promptly to any students in crisis. Both teachers and administrators should continuously assess and act on threats to student safety, developing a collaborative and supportive plan for students, educators and staff. Ultimately, the combined efforts of administrators and teachers will create a culture of trust, respect, and safety in the school environment.",
