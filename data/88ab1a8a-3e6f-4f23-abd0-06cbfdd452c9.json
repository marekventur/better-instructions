  "output": "One creative solution for reducing noise pollution is to plant more trees. Trees absorb sound and help to reduce noise pollution. Planting trees in areas with high levels of noise pollution can help to reduce the noise levels and create a more peaceful environment. Additionally, trees can help to reduce the amount of heat in an area, which can help to reduce noise levels further.",
