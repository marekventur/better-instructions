  "input": "a = 5\nb = 10\nc = a + b\nprint(\"The sum of a + b is: \" + c)",
  "output": "There is an error in this code because the argument of the print function must be a string, but the value of c is an integer. This can be fixed by converting c to a string before printing it. The corrected code should look like this:\n\na = 5\nb = 10\nc = a + b\nprint(\"The sum of a + b is: \" + str(c))",
