  "output": "Water is an example of a liquid that boils at a temperature higher than 100 \u00b0C. Water boils at 100 \u00b0C at sea level, but its boiling point increases with increasing altitude due to lower air pressure. For example, at an altitude of 8400 meters, water boils at around 106 \u00b0C.",
