  "output": "Heather was walking home from the bus stop one evening when she noticed an older man struggling to carry a large box. Seeing how much difficulty he was having, she quickly offered to help. The man gratefully accepted, and after helping him carry the box to his house, she was invited inside for a cup of tea. \n\nHeather soon saw that this man was living alone and, after talking for a while, realized he had not seen any of his family in a long time. She offered to help him get in contact with them, and after some searching, managed to find his daughter. During their conversation, she also realized he had some medical issues that he had been trying to manage by himself, and she promised to come back and help him with it. \n\nFor the next couple of months, she visited this man regularly and slowly but surely, she got him the medical help he needed. She also helped him find his family and reconnect with them. She was glad to have been able to make a difference in this man\u2019s life, and to know that her help made a real difference.",
