The farmer was so excited about this dream that he was determined to try and make it come true. So the next day he went to the nearby lake and waited for the geese to come. Soon enough, he saw a huge flock of geese flying overhead and he immediately started to chase after them. He ran from the lake all the way to his home and the geese followed him there. When the farmer reached his home, he was greeted by a huge crowd of villagers who were astonished to see the flock of geese that had followed the old farmer home. \n\nThe villagers realized that the old farmer had a special gift, he was blessed by the gods and was able to make his dreams come true. After that day, the old farmer was known as the goose Whisperer and he lived happily ever after.",
