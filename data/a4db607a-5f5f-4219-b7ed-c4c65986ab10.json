  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary difference between a regular search engine and a semantic search engine is the way they interpret and respond to queries. A regular search engine will look through documents keyword by keyword, while a semantic search engine can interpret the meaning of a query based on the context. A semantic search engine also often provides more accurate results, as it can recognize synonyms and other words related to the query term.",
