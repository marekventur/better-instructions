  "output": "Verse 1: \nThis is a story of dreams that come alive,\nIn the night they spark and make the heart sorive.\nIn the cold world of reality, these dreams let you fly,\nAnd your imagination soars high in the sky. \n\nVerse 2: \nRide on the wings of dream, never look back again,\nThe truth of what comes next makes you think and refrain.\nGoing through life is like being on a road,\nTake each step as if it flows - your future will mould. \n\nChorus: \nDreams - so precious, so pure,\nClose your eyes and dream an adventure so sure.\nYou gotta dream and make it come true,\nDreams will be your path to the greatness due.",
