  "output": "A sweatshop is a workplace with extremely poor working and wage conditions, usually for manufacturing goods. Sweatshops have been around for centuries, first appearing in Europe during the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and have been especially prevalent in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the United States. Workers in sweatshops are often subject to unsafe and unhealthy conditions, with very few safety measures in place and inadequate wages.",
