  "input": "",
  "output": "Reinforcement learning can be used in many practical applications, such as autonomous driving. Autonomous cars need to able to assess their environment and make decisions about their route, speed and other operations, such as when to start and stop. Reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to teach the autonomous vehicle to make the best decisions in a variety of situations, based on its experience and feedback from the environment.",
