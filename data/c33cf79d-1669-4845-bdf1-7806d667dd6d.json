  "output": "A solar cell is made up of several components. These include a semiconductor material such as silicon, an anti-reflective coating, metal contacts, and a transparent protective layer. The semiconductor material is the heart of the solar cell and absorbs the sunlight, which then generates an electric current. The current is collected by the metal contacts and travels through the external wiring to be used elsewhere. The anti-reflective coating helps the cell absorb more sunlight and the transparent protective layer helps protect the cell from environmental conditions such as dust, wind, and even physical damage.",
