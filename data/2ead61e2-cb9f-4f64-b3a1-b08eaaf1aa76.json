  "input": "",
  "output": "An electromagnetic wave is a type of wave that consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. It propagates through space, transferring energy from one location to another. The wave travels at the speed of light in a vacuum, which is roughly 3.00 x 10^8 meters per second. As it moves, the wave can be absorbed by objects or reflected back by them. When passing through matter, the wave can also be scattered by particles in the medium. This scattering can reduce the energy of the wave and thus the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation. It can also affect the frequency of the wave, resulting in a change in the color of the light. In general, electromagnetic waves can travel in a straight line or in curved paths, depending on the structure of the medium it is passing through.",
