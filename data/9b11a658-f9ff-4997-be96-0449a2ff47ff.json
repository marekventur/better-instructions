  "output": "The night was dark and the wind was howling. Rachel was alone in her house, the only sound in the air was the ticking of the clock, painfully loud in the eerie silence. All of a sudden, her phone rang, breaking the thick silence. Without thinking, Rachel picked up the phone, her heart beating faster. \"Hello, who is this?\" she asked, her voice shaking. But there was no answer. Rachel hung up, her hands shaking. Then the phone rang again, and again, and again. Every time Rachel picked up, there was the same silence. Finally, Rachel could stand it no longer and slammed the phone down. Suddenly, the silence was shattered by a chilling sound coming from the other end of the line, a voice, dense and ethereal, \"I'm coming for you, Rachel\" it whispered. Rachel screamed and ran out of her house, never looking back.",
