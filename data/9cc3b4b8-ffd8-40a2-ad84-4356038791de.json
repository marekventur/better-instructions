  "output": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, home appliances, vehicles, and other items embedded with technology that enables them to connect and exchange data. With the IoT, these devices can be connected and controlled from anywhere, allowing for improved convenience, comfort, and efficiency in everyday life. For example, one can control their home appliances remotely, meaning one can turn lights on or off, adjust the temperature, or start the dishwasher -all without having to physically be in the house. It also means one can monitor energy usage and optimize energy efficiency. The possibilities are endless.",
