  "input": "",
  "output": "The American Civil War was fought primarily between the Northern and Southern states from 1861 to 1865 over the issue of states\u2019 rights, an issue that had been in dispute since the Constitution was ratified. By popular opinion in the South, these rights included the right to keep and extend slavery. Northern states disagreed and tensions led to secession and the firing on Fort Sumter in 1861. The war being fought to preserve the Union soon escalated into a conflict over the extension of slavery. Many other issues such as taxes, inflation, and economic principles were also at the heart of the conflict.",
