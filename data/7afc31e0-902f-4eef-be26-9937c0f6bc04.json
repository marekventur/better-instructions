  "output": "A wizard, old and wise, \nStumbled upon a dragon's lair\nWhere no one had dared to go before \nThrough an unknown, unexplored stair. \n \nThe dragon lay dormant until it heard\nThis mysterious intruder's dreams,\nAnd opened its eyes to boldly stare \nAt the wizard and his schemes. \n \nThe wizard stood in awe of the beast\nBut he was not afraid,\nFor he seen this creature's eyes of golden hue\nAnd its fierce fire was his trade. \n \nTogether they ventured onward, \nTraveling far from home.\nThrough magical forests, dark caves, and ancient ruins,\nOn a quest to find their own. \n \nThe wizard and the dragon, \nRacing through time, \nGrowing ever closer in their hearts and minds, \nForging a bond that none could bind. \n \nThe wizard and the dragon,\nFriends for eternity,\nWere forever linked by their magical bond\nIn a strange and wondrous world, where they were meant to be.",
