  "instruction": "Create a program to identify whether a person is speaking English or Spanish.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The program should take an audio sample as input and then perform a series of steps to identify whether the language is English or Spanish. First, the system should use a speech recognition algorithm to convert the audio into text. Then, the system should use natural language processing algorithms to analyze the text and identify which language is being spoken. After that, the system should use a machine learning algorithm to determine the language of the audio sample with a high degree of accuracy.",
