  "input": "",
  "output": "The melody for a song about a summer night could have a slow, mellow tempo that reflects the warmth of the night and the peacefulness of the surrounding environment. It could open with a flute part accompanied by a gentle arpeggio in the background that gives the song its gentle atmosphere. Throughout the piece, the string section can provide a romantic sound that pays tribute to the beauty of the night, with a light piano melody in the lead role.",
