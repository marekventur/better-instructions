  "input": "",
  "output": "Podcasts are digital audio files that can be accessed online, whereas radio is broadcast over the airwaves. Podcasts are typically structured into episodic series, while radio is generally more of a continuous stream of content. Podcasts usually come with a wider range of topics and can be accessed on-demand, whereas radio programming is limited to a particular region or station.",
