  "input": "",
  "output": "Formal letters are written for professional or business purposes and use formal language, whereas informal letters are written for personal communication and can contain informal language. Formal letters use a fixed format or style, use polite language, and avoid using contractions or abbreviations. Informal letters are typically written in a conversational style and may include slang or abbreviations. Formal letters should use the third person, whereas informal letters may use the first or second person. Formal letters include a signature line, while informal letters typically do not. Formal letters often include a closing line, such as \"Sincerely,\" while informal letters may end more casually with phrases such as \"Take care,\" or \"Love.\"",
