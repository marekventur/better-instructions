  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial Intelligence technology is being used in medicine to diagnose medical conditions, improve medical imaging, and identify potential medical treatments. It is also being used to develop personalized medicine, analyze medical datasets and databases, monitor patient vital signs, automate medical processes, and create virtual healthcare assistants. Artificial intelligence is helping to improve both healthcare efficiency and patient outcomes.\n\nIt is also being used to create robots for minimally-invasive surgery, assist radiologists with medical imaging analysis, assist in drug discovery, and provide virtual medical consultations. AI is being used to drive teaching and training in medical school, track and monitor the spread of infectious diseases, and reduce healthcare costs. In the future, it may be used to replace human clinicians for routine medical tasks.",
