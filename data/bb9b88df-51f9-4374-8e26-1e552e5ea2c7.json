  "input": "",
  "output": "Running is an effective way of movement in humans, and it is made possible by the coordinated and efficient use of muscles. When running, the arms and legs are propelled forward in alternating patterns with the feet contacting the ground and propelling the body forward. The muscles transfer power from the lower legs to create a driven and efficient sequence of motion in the hips, abdomen, torso and arms. The hip muscles are particularly important as they are responsible for flexing and extending the knee and hip joints to allow for strides when running.",
