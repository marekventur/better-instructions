  "input": "",
  "output": "The neural network should be composed of two convolutional layers and two pooling layers. It should also be connected with a fully connected layer of 128 neurons to classify the cats and dogs photographs. After constructing the network layers, the network should be trained with a dataset consisting of cats and dogs images.",
