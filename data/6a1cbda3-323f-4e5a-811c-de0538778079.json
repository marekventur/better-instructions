  "input": "",
  "output": "The best approach to managing a conflict between two individuals is by first listening and understanding each side's perspective. Reflect back to each person what you heard to ensure that it was accurately heard and understood. Then, each side should come up with a set of possible solutions and discuss their pros and cons. Finally, reach an agreement on the best course of action. This approach fosters collaboration and open communication, and encourages both sides to reach a resolution that is mutually beneficial.",
