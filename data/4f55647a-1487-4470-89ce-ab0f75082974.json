  "output": "A/B test plan: The size of product images on the homepage will be modified over a 4-week period, with two versions of the homepage existing during this period. Half of the total visits to the homepage will be randomly sent to version A, which will display larger images, while the other half will be randomly sent to version B, which will remain unchanged. At the end of the 4-week period, the data collected will be analyzed to determine which version of the homepage had the highest impact on sales and conversions.",
