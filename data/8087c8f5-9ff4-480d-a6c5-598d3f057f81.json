  "input": "",
  "output": "The saying \"all's fair in love and war\" suggests that in certain contexts, it is acceptable to use any kind of means or methods necessary to achieve an objective, regardless of the usually accepted standards of moral or ethical behaviour. This implies that when in love or war, anything goes, and that people should be willing to do whatever they can to get the desired result. This saying is often used to justify unethical behaviour in the pursuit of what is considered to be a higher cause.",
