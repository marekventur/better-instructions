  "instruction": "Design an algorithm to classify text into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One approach to classify text into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment is to make use of machine learning algorithms. A corpus of data labeled as positive, negative, or neutral can be used to train a classifier model, such as support vector machines (SVMs) or Naive Bayes classifiers, to accurately identify the sentiment of given text. Another approach is to make use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as sentiment analysis tools to automatically classify given text into one of the three sentiment categories.",
