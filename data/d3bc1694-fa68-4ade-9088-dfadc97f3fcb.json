  "input": "",
  "output": "Robotics has potential applications in a variety of fields. One example is in healthcare where robots can be used to assist medical professionals with mundane tasks, freeing up their time to focus on more complex tasks. Robots can also be used in surgery. They are able to be more precise than humans, leaving less margin for error. Another application of robotics is in industry, where robots are used for assembly and automation tasks in manufacturing. They can take on jobs that are too dangerous for humans, increase efficiency, and reduce stress on workers.",
