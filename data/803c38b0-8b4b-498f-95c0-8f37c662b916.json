  "instruction": "Explain why mutation is important for genetic diversity.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Mutation is important for genetic diversity because it is the only way to introduce genetic variation into a population. Mutations can cause new alleles to arise, which can change a population's gene frequencies and therefore produce new characteristics. This is a key process in evolution and is necessary for natural selection to act on populations, allowing them to adapt to their environment.",
