  "output": "An earthquake is a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. These waves can cause vibrations that are strong enough to shake the ground, break apart buildings, and cause other damage. Earthquakes are usually caused by the shifting of tectonic plates, allowing built-up energy to be released rapidly. Earthquakes may also be caused by other events, such as volcanoes and landslides.",
