  "input": "",
  "output": "Genetic variation refers to the differences in the genetic makeup of different individuals within a species. It occurs when there is a change in the sequence or composition of genes due to the inheritance of mutations or variations in the genetic material. These mutations or variations can be caused by environmental factors, such as radiation or exposure to chemicals, or they can be passed down from parent to offspring. Genetic variation can result in individuals having different physical characteristics, such as hair and eye color, and can also affect the way an organism responds to disease or environmental conditions.",
