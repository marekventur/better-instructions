  "output": "Good morning everyone, \n\nToday, I\u2019m here to talk to you about the importance of decreasing the use of plastic. Plastic pollution is a growing problem that affects not only our environment, but also our health. From our oceans to our landfills, plastic pollution is becoming increasingly pervasive and is destroying our planet. \n\nPlastic production involves many toxins which are hazardous to our environment and health. Studies have shown that long-term exposure to these toxins can lead to severe health problems. Additionally, plastic pollution is not biodegradable and takes years to break down. It is estimated that a single plastic bottle takes 450 years to completely decompose. This means that our planet is continuously accumulating waste that could have been prevented. \n\nIt is time for us to make a change now. We can all start by doing our part and reducing our plastic usage. Here are a few ways we can achieve this: 1) Avoid drinking from single-use plastic water bottles. 2) Utilize reusable bags for grocery shopping. 3) Choose items with minimal plastic packaging and wrapping. 4) Recycle whenever possible. \n\nIf we all take the time to make small, conscious changes in our daily lives, it\u2019ll be easier to create a sustainable future. Let\u2019s all make a pledge to reduce our plastic usage and work together to save the environment. \n\nThank you for your time.",
