  "instruction": "Create a head-to-toe look using the given product combination.",
  "input": "Mid-heel pump, pencil skirt, braided belt.",
  "output": "This look is perfect for a day at the office. Start with the mid-heel pump in a neutral color such as black or beige. Pair it with a slim-fitting pencil skirt that flares just above the knee. Then add a braided belt for a touch of texture and to keep the look streamlined. Finish it off with a blouse in a washed-out hue, a structured blazer with slender lapels, and a stylish piece of jewelry.",
