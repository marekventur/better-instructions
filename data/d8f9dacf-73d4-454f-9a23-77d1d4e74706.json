  "instruction": "How does nitrogen cycle occur in the environment?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of nitrogen into and out of various environmental reservoirs. Nitrogen is used in many processes in the environment, such as photosynthesis and denitrification. During the process of photosynthesis, nitrogen is taken in by plants and converted into energy. Nitrogen is then released into the atmosphere in the form of nitrogen gas. The nitrogen then enters the soil through rainfall and is broken down by bacteria and fungi into ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite. This can be taken up by plants and then enter the food web where it is passed along between organisms. The cycle is concluded when nitrates and nitrites are denitrified back into nitrogen gas and transported back into the atmosphere.",
