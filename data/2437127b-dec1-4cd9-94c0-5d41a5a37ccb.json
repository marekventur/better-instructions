  "output": "I'm currently in a medium sized room with tan walls and a large window facing east. The hardwood floor has a light oak shade, and it is littered with scatter rugs in complementary shades of tan and brown. There are a few small paintings and photographs decorating the walls, and a cozy armchair sits in one corner. The room has a calming atmosphere and is lightly illuminated by a few table lamps.",
