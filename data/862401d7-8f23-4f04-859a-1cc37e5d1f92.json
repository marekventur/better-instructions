  "instruction": "Determine the moment of inertia of the following shape.",
  "input": "Shape: Rectangle width = 5 m and length = 7 m",
  "output": "The moment of inertia of the rectangle can be calculated using the formula I = mr2, where m is the mass of the rectangle, and r is the radius of gyration. Using these values of m and r, the moment of inertia of the rectangle can be calculated as I = 35 m4.",
