  "input": "\"What we think, we become\" -Buddha",
  "output": "This quote is attributed to the Buddha, and is thought to suggest that our thoughts have a profound effect on our lives and our destiny. The idea is that we create our own life experiences by what we think, and so by having positive thoughts, we can create positive circumstances in our lives. Alternatively, it implies that if someone focuses too deeply on negative ideas, they can bring negative aspects into their life. Our thoughts and attitudes can shape our lives and so it is wise to focus on positive ideas.",
