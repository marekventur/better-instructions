Here are some instructions to create a healthy dinner plate: \n\n1. Start with a plate that is no more than 9 inches in diameter.\n\n2. Fill a quarter of the plate with lean proteins, such as grilled chicken, fish, eggs, or tofu.\n\n3. Fill the other quarter with whole grains, such as brown rice, quinoa, bulgur, or barley.\n\n4. Fill the remaining half with vegetables, such as broccoli, kale, bell peppers, or spinach.\n\n5. Add one to two tablespoons of a healthy fat, such as olive oil, avocado, or nuts.\n\n6. Finish with a small serving of fruit.\n\n7. Enjoy your healthy dinner plate!",
