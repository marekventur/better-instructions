  "output": "Digital telepathy is the ability to communicate intelligently and seamlessly with digital interfaces that understand and predict what their users need. It works by using artificial intelligence and natural language processing to allow a machine to understand user intent and provide the best possible response. This enables machines to better anticipate user needs and respond accordingly, creating a more intuitive and personal experience.",
