  "output": "A comprehensive strategy to effectively combat global poverty should include elements of both economic growth and social protection. To kickstart economic growth, governments must invest in job creation, technological innovation, and infrastructure improvements. At the same time, social protection policies should ensure that marginalized individuals have access to essential services and safety nets. Additionally, international organizations should develop strategies to better coordinate efforts to deliver humanitarian aid and reduce inequality between nations.",
