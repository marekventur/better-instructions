  "instruction": "Create a spreadsheet to track monthly expenses",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The spreadsheet should have a simple, user-friendly layout and should include columns for each month with titles such as \u201cDate\u201d, \u201cCategory\u201d, \u201cSub-Category\u201d, \u201cDescription\u201d, \u201cAmount\u201d and \u201cNet\u201d. The first row should contain headers defining these columns. Underneath the headers, the user should be able to document the date, category of the expense, sub-category (if applicable), a brief description of the expense, the amount of the expense and a running total for the month. Once the spreadsheet is populated with the user\u2019s expenses, a graph should be automatically generated to visually represent the expenses, the categories, and the net amount paid for the month. This will help the user track spending habits and identify areas for potential savings.",
