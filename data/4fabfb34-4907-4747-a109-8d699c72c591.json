  "output": "Data storage policies are important for organizations in order to ensure security and compliance of the data. These policies lay down the rules for collecting, storing, protecting, and sharing data within an organization. If a organization does not have clear data storage policies, then they may face legal liability or reputational damage due to data breaches or leaks. Additionally, a lack of data storage policies may make the organization vulnerable to cyber attacks or other malicious activities.",
