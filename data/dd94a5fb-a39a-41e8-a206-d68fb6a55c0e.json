  "output": "The heart is a muscular organ that pumps oxygenated and nutrient-rich blood throughout the body. It is divided into four chambers: the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles. The atria receive incoming blood, which is then pumped into the ventricles and then out of the heart to the body's other organs. The heart also acts as a regulator of blood pressure and helps maintain the body's fluid balance.",
