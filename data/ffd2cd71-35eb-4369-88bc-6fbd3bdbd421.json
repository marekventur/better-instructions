  "input": "Hero's superpower: Can control and manipulate magnetism",
  "output": "The costume design for the superhero would feature a black bodysuit with metallic blue and silver accents. The suit would use powerful magnets to enhance the hero's control over magnetism. It would feature a black helmet with a lightning-like design above the eyes connecting to the blue and silver accents across the suit. The helmet design would give the superhero a distinctive and intimidating look. The suit would also contain metallic pads along the arms and legs that could be used to help control and manipulate magnetism, such as attracting and repelling objects from a distance.",
