The film still manages to capture the environment of its outer-space setting, feeling both raw in its emotion and extraordinary in its visuals. Brad gives an emotional performance that conveys the ins and outs of what it takes to be a human in space. This movie is sure to leave an impression on you as it takes you on an engrossing journey of exploration and adventure.",
