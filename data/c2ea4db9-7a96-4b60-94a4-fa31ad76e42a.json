  "output": "Five possible applications of facial recognition technology are: \n- Automated security: Facial recognition can be used to identify or authenticate people in physical locations, such as airports and other secure sites. \n- Personal identification: Facial recognition can be used to quickly and accurately identify people in places where traditional methods of identification are not available, such as online or remote locations. \n- Customer service: Facial recognition can be used to streamline customer service, such as for call centers, by quickly identifying a customer\u2019s identity. \n- Law enforcement: Facial recognition can be used to identify criminals, who are then subject to further investigation. \n- Health care: Facial recognition can be used to detect or monitor changes in patients\u2019 health over time, aiding doctors in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions.",
