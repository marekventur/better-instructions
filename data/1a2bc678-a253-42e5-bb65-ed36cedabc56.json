  "instruction": "What is the greenhouse effect and why is it bad?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The greenhouse effect is the process by which certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat and prevent it from escaping. This trapping of heat is caused by the absorption of infrared radiation by certain gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which are released from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels. The problem with the greenhouse effect is that it increases the average global temperature, which can lead to extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and heat waves. It can also cause ocean acidification, disrupt ecosystems, and increase the frequency and intensity of storms.",
