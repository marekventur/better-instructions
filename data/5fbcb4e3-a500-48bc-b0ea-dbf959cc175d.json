  "input": "",
  "output": "The human brain stores information using networks of neurons that are connected via synapses. When an experience is remembered or recalled, these synapses increase the connections between neurons, which is how memories are encoded and stored. Additionally, the hippocampus serves as a gateway to the brain, helping to intervene in the formation and recall of memories.",
