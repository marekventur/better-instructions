  "output": "The Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the largest species of penguin, and is native to the Antarctic. They have distinctive yellow ear patches and a bright orange-yellow bill. Emperor Penguins can grow up to 122 centimeters tall, and live in large colonies of up to several thousand birds. These large colonies breed during the Antarctic winter and the eggs are incubated by the males while the females search for food. Emperor Penguins are currently listed as a species of least concern, but their population is declining due to changing climate conditions in Antarctica.",
