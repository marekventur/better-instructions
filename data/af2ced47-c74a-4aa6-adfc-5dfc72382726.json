  "output": "Zinfandel is a medium-bodied red wine with a rich, robust flavor profile. It has aromas of blackberry, cherry, and raspberry, as well as hints of pepper, cloves, and anise. On the palate, it is plush and full-bodied with flavors of jammy fruits, sweet spices, and a juicy finish. It pairs well with food that has bold flavors, such as barbecued meats, grilled vegetables, and sharp cheese.",
