  "input": "",
  "output": "My hypothesis is that people yawn in order to regulate brain temperature and increase alertness. Yawning helps to draw cool air into the lungs, which cools the blood and reduces the temperature of the brain. It also increases the amount of oxygen available to the brain, which facilitates alertness.",
