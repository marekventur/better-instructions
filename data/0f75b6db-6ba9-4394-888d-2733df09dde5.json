Then gather some branches and twigs for the arms and such. Next, you'll need to form three large, evenly-sized balls of snow. Place them on top of each other and pack them together as much as possible. Now add on the twigs and branches for the arms, create your snowman's face with rocks or other materials, and finish off with a scarf and a hat. And voila! You now have a snowman.",
