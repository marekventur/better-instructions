  "instruction": "Generate an interesting way to reform laws concerning tax evasion.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "To reform laws concerning tax evasion, government agencies should consider instituting an increased monetary penalty for offenders as well as a public shaming system. This system could include publicizing the names and photos of convicted tax evaders, or even their professional or family affiliations. In addition, government agencies should consider implementing methods of tracking self-employed individuals and businesses more closely, such as registering vehicles used for business purposes and requiring registration of those vehicles with tax authorities. Finally, there should be a greater emphasis on educating citizens about the penalties and implications associated with tax evasion. By improving awareness of the consequences of tax evasion, citizens will be more likely to comply with legal regulations and avoid the penalties that accompany breaking the law.",
