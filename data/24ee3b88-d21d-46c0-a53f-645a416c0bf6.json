  "instruction": "Explain the concept of Interplanetary Transfer Trajectories.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Interplanetary transfer trajectories are paths in space that spacecraft can take to travel between different planets. These trajectories are determined by the gravitational attractions of the planets, which influence the amount of energy needed to move between them. The trajectory must also take into account propulsion capabilities of the spacecraft and other factors, such as the desired time of arrival. Interplanetary transfer trajectories are usually elliptical orbits, and can cover a range of distances and durations.",
