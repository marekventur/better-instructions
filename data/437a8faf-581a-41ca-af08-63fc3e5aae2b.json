  "input": "",
  "output": "The technology used in the original web (web 1.0) was limited to static webpages, and the primary focus was on the visual aspects of web design. Web 1.0 technologies lacked most of the interactivity and personalization that is commonplace today.\n\nThe use of web technologies in web 2.0 are much more complex, with the focus being on the development of dynamic webpages that can offer user interaction, personalization, and social interaction. Content is the main emphasis, and user content and interaction is encouraged. This encourages the development of communities and apps using extensive backend programming.",
