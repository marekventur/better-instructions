  "input": "Ending global poverty.",
  "output": "I believe in ending global poverty because everyone deserves the right to have their basic needs met, no matter where they live. Poverty affects not just people's finances, but their health, their education, and their quality of life. It also perpetuates inequality, limits access to opportunities, and puts people at greater risk of exploitation and abuse. Ending global poverty will lead to a better future for everyone, and I am committed to doing my part to make this a reality.",
