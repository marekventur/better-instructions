  "instruction": "Explain why cell phones should not be allowed in the classroom.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Cell phones should not be allowed in the classroom because they are a major distraction. Students tend to be more focused when they don't have their phones nearby and they can't access social media or other apps. Cell phones can also be a source of cheating, as students may be able to use their phones to look up answers during tests or assignments. Allowing cell phones in the classroom can also be a security risk, as personal information can be easily shared with anyone who has access to a student's phone.",
