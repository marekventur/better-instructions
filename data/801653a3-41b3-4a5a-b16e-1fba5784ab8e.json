Every day, the villagers would go out to pick fruit, vegetables, and herbs from the lush foliage to use in their cooking. One day, while out picking, they noticed something strange in the distance. As they got closer, they could see that it was a huge, shimmering lake. The villagers were amazed and decided to explore the lake and the secrets it may hold. As the sun set, the lake glowed brighter and brighter. They watched in awe, unable to look away, until eventually the lake faded into the night.",
