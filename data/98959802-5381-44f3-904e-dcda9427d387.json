  "instruction": "List five challenges that have been faced when trying to develop artificial intelligence systems.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Limited Data: AI systems usually rely on massive data sets to learn from, but acquiring such data can be expensive, difficult and time-consuming.\n2. Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when an AI system is trained to closely mimic its training data set, reducing its ability to generalize and learn.\n3. Bias: AI systems can be prone to bias, carrying the creator's conscious or unconscious biases with them.\n4. Safety and Control: AI systems are becoming autonomous with increasing capabilities and autonomy, creating challenges for oversight and accountability.\n5. Distributed Computing: Training AI models is computationally intensive, requiring distributed computing to divide the load across multiple computers.",
