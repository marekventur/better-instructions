  "output": "Chess is a two-player board game played on a square board made up of sixty-four squares. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king. Each player has sixteen pieces, with one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces move according to predetermined rules, with the goal of capturing their opponent's pieces or checkmating their king by putting it into a position where it cannot escape capture. Players can also win the game by trapping their opponent so that they cannot make any legal moves.",
