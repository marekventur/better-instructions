  "output": "One potential solution to the problem of hunger in developing countries is to promote sustainable food production. This can be done by providing support and training to local farmers, investing in agricultural research and development, and encouraging government policies that promote and protect small-scale food production. Additionally, efforts should be made to support local initiatives that increase access to food, such as community gardens, school breakfast and lunch programs, and food banks.",
