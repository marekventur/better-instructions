  "output": "Earthquakes are a common occurrence, with over 500,000 estimated to take place around the world each year. The majority of earthquakes measure less than 3.0 on the Richter scale and go undetected by humans. The largest recorded earthquake to date was a magnitude 8.9 off the coast of Japan in 2011. Earthquakes can cause major destruction and loss of life, however, they are also responsible for creating new islands and changes to the land.",
