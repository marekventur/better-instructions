  "input": "",
  "output": "Technology can be used to address the problem of climate change in many ways. For example, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy can help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. New technologies such as carbon capture and storage could be used to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Advances in energy efficiency and smart grids can help reduce energy consumption and waste. Finally, new technologies such as artificial intelligence can be used to better understand and predict the impacts of climate change.",
