  "input": "Classifying text into categories",
  "output": "A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) could be used as a machine learning algorithm for classifying text into categories. First, the text should be converted into numerical features using a vectorizer (e.g. Bag-of-Words). Then, the input features need to be split into training and test datasets. Finally, an MLP model should be constructed with the relevant parameters such as hidden layer sizes and activation functions. After training the model, it can be used to classify text into different categories.",
