  "input": "",
  "output": "Capital punishment, the death penalty, has been debated for centuries, with some citing its use as a deterrent for crime and others pointing to its potential for wrongful executions and vengeful punishments. Aside from the ethical implications of capital punishment, there are legal, financial, and practical implications that must be considered. Legally, well-established protocols must be met to ensure a fair trial and avoid wrongful convictions. Financially, capital punishment cases often require a lot of resources, and practical implications include the time it takes to carry out the sentence and the emotional toll it can take on the families of both victim and perpetrator.",
