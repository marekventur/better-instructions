  "input": "",
  "output": "A hash table can be used to store the dictionary of 5,000 words, as it allows for efficient retrieval of words in the dictionary. The data structure would use a hash function to calculate an index based on the key of each word, which can then be used to retrieve the value (the word itself) in the dictionary.",
