  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the most widely accepted scientific evidences that supports the theory of evolution is the fossil record. The fossil record provides direct physical evidence of the existence of extinct species, as well as evidence that the Earth is much older than previously believed. It also shows how ancient species have changed over time, with new species arising and old species becoming extinct. Additionally, the study of biochemical systems provides further evidence of evolution, as similar genetic sequences can be found between different species. This provides evidence of a common ancestor for all living organisms.",
