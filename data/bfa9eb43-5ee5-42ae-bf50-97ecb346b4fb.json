  "input": "",
  "output": "Adversarial examples are inputs to a machine learning model that are designed to reduce the model's performance. These examples are usually generated by adding small perturbations to test inputs that are \"invisible\" to humans, but cause the model to incorrectly classify or produce the wrong output. This is because the model has not been trained on these examples and thus, is not able to identify them as incorrect. As a result, adversarial examples can be used to deliberately degrade the performance of the model.",
