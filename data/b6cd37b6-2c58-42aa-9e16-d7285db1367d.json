  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a web application and a mobile app is the way they are accessed and the platforms they are designed for. Web applications are accessed through a browser and are designed to work across all platforms such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. Mobile apps, on the other hand, are designed to be used on specific platforms such as iOS and Android and are typically downloaded and installed on the device. Mobile apps may also allow access to device features such as cameras and GPS which are not typically available on web applications. Overall, the main difference between a web application and a mobile app is the platform and the functionality they provide.",
