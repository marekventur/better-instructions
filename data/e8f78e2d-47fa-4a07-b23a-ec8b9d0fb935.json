  "input": "",
  "output": "GPT models are a type of language model developed by OpenAI and used in natural language processing (NLP). They are based on a deep neural network architecture, and can generate natural-sounding and grammatically correct responses to given prompts. GPT models are used in tasks such as question-answering, automatic summarization, natural language generation, and text understanding. GPT models have shown impressive results in these tasks and their popularity is rapidly increasing in the research community. In the future, GPT models may be used to develop even more advanced language processing applications, ultimately leading to more efficient, automated, and conversational AI systems.",
