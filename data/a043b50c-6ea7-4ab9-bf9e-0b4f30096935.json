  "output": "Polar bears live in the circumpolar Arctic region, which includes parts of Alaska, Canada, Norway, and Russia. They inhabit the polar ice pack, spending much of their time on the sea ice hunting their primary prey, seals. They require a large home range to support their diet and typically hunt for food within a 60 kilometer radius of their den or birthing area. They also rely on coastal areas for denning and during the summer months, when the sea ice breaks up and melts, they hunt in offshore islands and terrestrial areas.",
