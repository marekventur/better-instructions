  "input": "",
  "output": "Without computers, the pace of progress would undoubtedly be far slower.  Computers have revolutionized many aspects of life - from communication to medicine, transportation, and so much more. We would be relying on older, more analogue technology to process data, meaning tasks would take much longer to complete. People may have more free time, but overall quality of life would be impacted due in large part to technology not being able to progress as quickly.",
