  "output": "John was a lawyer, and a great one at that. He had a passion for solving mysteries and finding justice in even the most complex cases. One day, he got a call from his friend Doc, who had heard about a mysterious case and thought John would be the perfect person to help figure it out.\n\nJohn arrived at the courthouse and was immediately captivated by the prospect of working on the case. He was given a folder containing the details of the case, but he was unable to make much sense of it at first glance. He read through it several times, hoping to uncover a key piece of evidence or lead.\n\nAfter numerous hours of hard work, John found what he believed to be the secret of the case. With this information in hand, he went to court and presented his case to the judge. The judge was extremely impressed with John's work, and he ruled in favor of John's client.\n\nThe case was a huge success and John felt a great sense of satisfaction. He had worked hard to put together a great case and deliver a fair judgement to his client. It was a victory for everyone involved and a great victory for justice.",
