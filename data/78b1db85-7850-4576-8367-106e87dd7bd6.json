  "output": "Stress has been linked to many negative physical health effects, such as heart disease, weakened immune system, headache and other problems. Stress can cause the body to produce too much cortisol, which can lead to high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases. In addition, chronic stress can result in muscle pain, digestive problems as well as digestive issues. \n\nThe physical effects of stress can be managed through relaxation techniques, physical exercise and proper nutrition. Regular physical activity \u2013 such as jogging, swimming, biking or walking \u2013 helps to reduce stress levels by releasing endorphins and increasing blood flow to the brain. Engaging in regular relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and practicing yoga, can also help to reduce stress levels and its associated physical effects. Lastly, eating a balanced diet and ensuring that the body is getting proper nourishment is key in reducing stress and its effects on physical health.",
