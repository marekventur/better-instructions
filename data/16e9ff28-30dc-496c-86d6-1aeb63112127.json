  "input": "",
  "output": "A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth's shadow covers the Moon, while a solar eclipse occurs when the Moon covers the Sun. Eclipse periods vary depending on their type but generally last between 2 to 3 hours. Lunar eclipses typically occur once every six months, while solar eclipses occur once every 18 months. In rare cases, total eclipses can occur more frequently, with a cycle of roughly one every 175ths of a year.",
