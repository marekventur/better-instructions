  "input": "",
  "output": "Technology can help children with autism in a variety of ways. First, technology can be used to help children with autism to develop their communication and social skills. For example, apps such as Proloquo2go and TouchChat may be used to teach children to use a voice-recognition system to communicate more effectively. In addition, computers and tablets can also be used to help with social skills by providing an engaging interface to practice virtual social scenarios.\n\nTechnology can also be used to help children with autism learn how to manage their emotions and behavior. Technology such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is widely used in special education settings to help children with autism learn positive behaviors and emotional regulation. Moreover, virtual reality systems can be used to help children with autism understand social cues and learn social skills; this approach has been gaining increasing attention in recent years.\n\nFinally, technology can also be used to facilitate independent living for individuals with autism by helping ensure their safety. Several wearables and apps have been designed specifically to help keep track of individuals with autism and alert caregivers when necessary. Additionally, various home automation systems may be used to not only help individuals with autism regulate their daily routines but also improve their quality of life overall.",
