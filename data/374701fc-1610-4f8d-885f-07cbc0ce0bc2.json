  "input": "The program is giving me an error message: \"invalid syntax\".",
  "output": "The cause of this error message is that the syntax of the code is incorrect. This means that the code contains a grammar, formatting, or punctuation mistake, which results in the interpreter or compiler not being able to decipher what the code should do. To resolve this issue, you need to go through the code and look for any syntactical mistakes, such as missing quotation marks, incorrect indentation, or incorrect punctuation. Once the mistake is corrected, you can try running the code again.",
