  "instruction": "Answer the following query about gender roles in society",
  "input": "What changes can be made to traditional gender roles in a progressive society?",
  "output": "Traditional gender roles in a progressive society can be challenged and changed in many ways. For example, the idea that men should be the breadwinners and women should be subordinated at home should be overturned. Women should be equally respected and given the same rights and opportunities as men in the workplace. Another example is to stop gender-based stereotypes and expectations of behavior. Women should be just as encouraged to pursue careers traditionally associated with men, and men should not be shamed for taking on traditionally female roles. Additionally, traditional gender roles around parenting and roles in childrearing should be more equally distributed between men and women. Ultimately, gender roles must be consensual and equal if society wants to be progressive.",
