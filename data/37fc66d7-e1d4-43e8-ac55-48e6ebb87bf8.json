  "input": "",
  "output": "Democratic forms of government are based on the principle of majority rule, where the people have a say in how the government is run. Autocratic forms of government are based on the idea of rule by one person or a small group of people who have absolute power and control over the populace. In democratic systems, the citizens have the right to participate in the decision-making process and are able to hold elected officials accountable. Autocratic systems, on the other hand, are typically characterized by authoritarian rule, lack of civil rights and freedoms, and concentrated power within a single leader or group.",
