  "instruction": "Create a list of five pros and five cons of the given technology.",
  "input": "Technology: Blockchain",
  "output": "Pros:\n1. High security: cryptographic hashes make Blockchain virtually impenetrable to cyber-attacks.\n2. Improved transparency: all transactional data is visible to all parties in a Blockchain.\n3. Low cost: Blockchain eliminates third-party intermediaries, reducing overhead costs.\n4. Greater durability: with no single point of failure, Blockchain is more reliable than traditional databases.\n5. Easy tracking: Blockchain allows for easier tracking of goods during the supply chain. \n\nCons:\n1. Energy consumption: Blockchain mining process is energy intensive.\n2. Complex implementation: the technical aspects of Blockchain can be difficult to understand and implement.\n3. Lack of scalability: Blockchain has limited transaction processing speed, which can be a hindrance when dealing with a large number of transactions.\n4. Regulatory environment: the decentralized nature of Blockchain means that regulatory requirements are still being developed.\n5. Privacy concerns: due to its public nature, there are privacy concerns over the data stored in Blockchain.",
