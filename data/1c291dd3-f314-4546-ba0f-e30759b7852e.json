  "output": "The Great Chicago Fire was a conflagration that burned in the American city of Chicago, Illinois, from October 8 to October 10, 1871. The fire killed up to 300 people, destroyed roughly 3.3 square miles of the city, and left more than 100,000 people homeless. The cause of the fire is unknown, but it started in a small barn owned by a Mrs. O'Leary and spread quickly with the help of strong winds. The fire destroyed an estimated 17,450 buildings, leaving an estimated 100,000 people homeless and causing an estimated $200 million in damages. Despite being one of the worst disasters to ever occur in United States history, the fire helped the city rebuild and led to new building codes, including the construction of large firebreaks around the city that may have saved it from further devastation. It was an important factor in Chicago's massive population growth that made the city the second-largest in the nation by 1890.",
