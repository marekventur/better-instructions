  "output": "Good evening everyone! Today I am here to speak about the benefits of artificial intelligence. AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in our lives, from working in factories, to self-driving cars, to helping us with everyday tasks. AI has the potential to help us in numerous ways, from increasing efficiency and productivity, to enabling us to take on more complex tasks. AI can also help us make more informed decisions, as well as automate mundane tasks, freeing up time for us to do the work that really matters. Finally, AI can even help us be more creative and innovative in our approach to problem-solving. Thank you for listening!",
