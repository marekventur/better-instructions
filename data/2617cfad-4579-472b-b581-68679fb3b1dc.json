  "input": "",
  "output": "Social media has had a profound effect on self-esteem, both positively and negatively. On one hand, it can facilitate connection and provide an outlet for expressing yourself. However, it can also be a source of negative comparisons and a platform for cyberbullying. There is now a body of evidence to suggest that long-term usage of social media can lead to a decrease in self-esteem in young people. \n\nWhen using social media, it is important to remember that the online world is largely curated and not an accurate reflection of reality. It is important to ask yourself if these are the types of connections that you want to be forming, and to question if your content is true to your values. Being mindful and discerning with your choice of content can help foster self-confidence and feelings of self-worth.",
