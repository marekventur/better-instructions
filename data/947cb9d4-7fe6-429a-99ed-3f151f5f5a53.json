  "input": "",
  "output": "Einstein's theory of relativity is one of the most important theories in modern physics. It revolutionized our understanding of space and time and introduced a new view of the universe. It explains how gravity works, how space and time are interconnected, and it provides the basis for understanding phenomena such as black holes and other exotic events. Relativity also predicted the expanding universe and laid the foundations for modern cosmology.",
