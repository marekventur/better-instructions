  "input": "",
  "output": "The three main types of bilingualism are simultaneous bilingualism, sequential bilingualism, and concurrent bilingualism. \n\nSimultaneous bilingualism occurs when two languages are learned simultaneously from birth. \n\nSequential bilingualism occurs when one language is learned first and a second language is then acquired later in life. \n\nConcurrent bilingualism occurs when two languages are learned at the same time in grade school without the need for one language to be learned first.",
