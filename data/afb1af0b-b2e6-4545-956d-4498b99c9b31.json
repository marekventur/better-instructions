  "output": "The sun had already set in the west when the old man noticed a light in the distance. As he got closer, he saw that the light was coming from a small cabin tucked away in the trees. He approached the cabin, curious as to who would be living there. When the man knocked on the door, the door opened and a young woman stepped outside. She had long black hair and a big smile. She said, \u201cHi, my name is Sarah. What brings you here?\" The old man told her his story and his plan to find a place to rest and stay the night. Sarah then invited him inside, sharing her cabin with him for the night. Little did either of them know that the small cabin was about to become the start of an epic adventure.",
