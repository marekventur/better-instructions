  "output": "1. Data collection: Collect data from various sources and store it in an organized manner. \n2. Data exploration: Examine the data and determine its content, quality, and structure.\n3. Data cleaning: Identify, correct, and delete outliers, incorrect values, and invalid entries.\n4. Data integration: Merge multiple datasets if necessary and clean the data further.\n5. Data transformation: Transform the data into a required format and/or representation.\n6. Data reduction: Reduce the dimensions of the data by eliminating redundant or irrelevant features.\n7. Data discretization: Split continuous data into groups or bins.\n8. Feature selection: Select the most important and relevant features for the model. \n9. Data scaling: Normalize the data by scaling all features to similar ranges.\n10. Recovery of data: Save pre-processed data in a suitable form for use in further steps.",
