  "input": "",
  "output": "In database management, a heartbeat is a background task that is performed regularly to ensure the database is up and running. The heartbeat helps detect any errors or problems with the database, and will alert system administrators so that they can be quickly remedied. The heartbeat also serves additional functions such as detecting connection drops, creating database backups, and determining whether database nodes are up or down.",
