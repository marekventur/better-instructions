  "input": "",
  "output": "When choosing a hairstyle, it is important to keep in mind your face shape, hair texture, and lifestyle. If you have a round face, try a hairstyle that frames the face with bangs or layers. For those with thicker hair, layers and shorter cuts can add texture and volume. Additionally, take into consideration your day-to-day lifestyle and choose a style that is easy to maintain and suits your needs.",
