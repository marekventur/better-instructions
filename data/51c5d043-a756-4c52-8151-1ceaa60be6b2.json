  "output": "The internet has had a profound effect on global culture and communication. It has opened up new avenues of communication and connected people in ways previously unimaginable. It has also created opportunities for instant access to vast amounts of information and knowledge, which has opened up new avenues of education and collaboration. On the other hand, the internet has created a new platform for the spread of misinformation and can amplify the messages of extremist groups. It can also be a source of cyber bullying and invasions of privacy.",
