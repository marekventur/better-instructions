  "output": "Global warming is causing the rise of average temperatures around the world, leading to more frequent and intense extreme weather events. These events include heat waves, floods, droughts, and more powerful hurricanes and typhoons. Additionally, rising temperatures are melting icecaps and glaciers, causing sea levels to rise and leading to flooding of coastal areas. The ocean is also becoming more acidic due to the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which affects its ecosystems. Global warming is also exacerbating environmental issues such as pollution and deforestation, further damaging our planet.",
