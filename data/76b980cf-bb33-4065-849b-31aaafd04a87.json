  "instruction": "Compose a melody based on the given C major scale.",
  "input": "C major scale",
  "output": "The melody starts off with C, going up to the fifth note in the scale, G. Then we go down to the third note in the scale, E, followed by D and then again G. We then go back to C and descend down to the fourth note of the scale, F. The melody then goes up to A and finally goes back to C. Therefore, the melody is C-G-E-D-G-C-F-A-C.",
