  "input": "",
  "output": "On a clear night, the moon can appear bright and full, with a silvery glow that highlights the craters and other features on its surface. It looks like a white disk against the backdrop of the night sky, surrounded by countless stars. Depending on its phase, it may also appear as a crescent or gibbous shape, with a subtle gradation of light that gives it an almost artistic quality.",
