  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the economic consequences of supply-side and demand-side economic policies",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Supply-side economic policies focus on increasing the productive capacity of the economy, usually through tax cuts and deregulation, while demand-side economic policies focus on increasing the aggregate demand for goods and services through government spending and triggering consumption by cutting taxes and interest rates. Supply-side policies are aimed at increasing the potential output of the economy and thus reducing price inflation, while demand-side policies aim at increasing aggregate demand and thus increasing price inflation. Furthermore, supply-side policies are generally seen as more effective in the short-term, while demand-side policies can have more benefits in the medium and long-term.",
