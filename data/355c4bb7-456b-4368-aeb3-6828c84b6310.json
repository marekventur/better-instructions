  "output": "A virtual assistant (VA) is a human-in-the-loop software program designed to provide human-like responses to customer inquiries. It relies on pre-programmed inputs and conversations and can respond to customer inquiries in a more natural way than a simple AI system. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) is a computer system that has the ability to learn and understand its environment with minimal to no human input. AI systems can provide more accurate and natural responses to customer inquiries than VAs can.",
