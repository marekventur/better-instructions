  "output": "Machine learning is revolutionizing the agriculture industry and enabling farmers to insightfully manage their operations. For example, sensors connected to IoT devices can be used to measure soil moisture, temperature and pH levels, enabling farmers to optimize their crop yield. Machine learning can also analyze historical data to predict weather patterns and advise farmers on when to plant, water and harvest. Additionally, machines can be used to detect weeds and disease and autonomously spray targeted doses of the right pesticide. For example, a farm in Pennsylvania is using computer vision and machine learning to classify weeds and guide an autonomous robot to precisely target and eliminate them.",
