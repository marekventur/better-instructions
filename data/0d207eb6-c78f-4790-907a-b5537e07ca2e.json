  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce power usage at home is to switch to energy efficient light bulbs such as LED bulbs, as they consume up to 90% less electricity than standard bulbs. Additionally, unplugging electronics when not in use, using efficient appliances, setting the temperature on the thermostat to be at least two degrees lower in the winter and two degrees higher in summer months, and turning off the air conditioners when no one is at home can reduce your power usage.",
