  "input": "How to calculate the area of a triangle?",
  "output": "The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula A = 1/2 (base x height). To calculate using this formula, measure the length of one of the sides of the triangle, which is the base, and then measure the height of the triangle, which is the distance from the base to the opposite vertex. Multiply the base and height together and then divide that result by two to get the area of the triangle.",
