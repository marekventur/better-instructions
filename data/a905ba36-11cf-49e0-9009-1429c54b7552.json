  "input": "",
  "output": "The fundamental principle of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. This means that no matter how fast the observer is moving, or in which direction, the physical laws of the universe should be consistent throughout. This principle was first articulated by Albert Einstein in his famous 1905 paper, \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\".",
