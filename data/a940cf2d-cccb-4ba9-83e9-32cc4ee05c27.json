His parents were amazed by his creativity and encouraged him to keep thinking \"out of the box\". One day, he was presented with a difficult riddle, but he was determined to solve it. After a few hours, his solution was the complete opposite of what anyone else had tried before. Everyone was impressed, and his solution soon became known as the phrase \"thinking out of the box\".",
