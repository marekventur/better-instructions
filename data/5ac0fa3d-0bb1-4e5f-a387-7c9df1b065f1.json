  "input": "",
  "output": "The access control policies for a cloud-based application can include policy-based access control, role-based access control, attribute-based access control, identity-based access control, and authentication-based access control. Policy-based access control uses predetermined rules to grant permissions for a user's activity. Role-based access control manages user permissions based on the user's assigned role. Attribute-based access control allows administrators to define certain attributes and grant or deny access according to those attributes. Identity-based access control assigns permissions to a user based on their unique identity. Finally, authentication-based access control requires users to authenticate before granting access.",
