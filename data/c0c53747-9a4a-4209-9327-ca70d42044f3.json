  "instruction": "Classify this dream as either real-life, lucid, or a nightmare",
  "input": "I am walking down a familiar street and I see a friend of mine. We start conversing, but the conversation is bizarre and no matter what I say, the words come out wrong.",
  "output": "This dream could be classified as a nightmare. In nightmares, the dreamer is often in a situation that is filled with anxiety, fear, and feelings of helplessness. It can be very difficult to control the situation or find a way to escape. In this dream, the conversations seem to be going wrong and the dreamer cannot find a way to respond correctly. This can increase the sense of helplessness and lead to a nightmare.",
