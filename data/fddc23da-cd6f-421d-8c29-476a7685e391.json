  "instruction": "How dense is a given material?",
  "input": "Steel",
  "output": "The density of steel is about 7.85 g/cm3. It is a relatively dense material with a specific gravity of 7.87, meaning it is 7.87 times heavier than water. Steel grades can vary in density, as lower-grade alloys tend to be lighter and higher-grade alloys tend to be heavier.",
