  "instruction": "Explain why the coffee shop is more expensive.",
  "input": "This coffee shop has a higher price than other coffee shops.",
  "output": "The coffee shop could be more expensive for a variety of reasons. It may offer higher-quality beans, more unique brewing methods, and locally-sourced ingredients that cost more than mass-produced products. It could also be based in a wealthier area with higher rental rates. Additionally, the shop may provide additional services or amenities, such as free WiFi, plush seating, and customer-focused service, that increase the overall cost of the product.",
