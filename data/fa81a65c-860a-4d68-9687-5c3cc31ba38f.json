  "instruction": "Describe how ice melts.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Ice melts when it absorbs enough energy in the form of heat to overcome the strong intermolecular forces that keep the molecules in their solid state. The heat breaks the bonds between molecules, changing the solid ice into liquid water. At 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F), it takes approximately 79.7 joules of energy to melt 1 gram of ice. This is why it is important to keep ice insulated to prevent it from melting too quickly.",
