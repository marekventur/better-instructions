  "input": "",
  "output": "Formal party attire can include a dress, suit or separates such as a skirt and blouse. For women, a dress in a classic material such as silk, velvet or satin in a timeless cut and color. For men, a classic suit in a solid color or pinstripe. Accesorizing with subtle statement jewelry, such as a pendant necklace or earrings, can add a finishing touch. Shoes should be dressy but comfortable and closed toe with a low heel.",
