  "input": "",
  "output": "A possible algorithm for finding a way out of a maze is to choose a direction to start from and explore that direction first. As you explore the maze, keep track of your movements, so you know where you\u2019ve been. If you hit a dead-end, turn around and choose another direction. Once you\u2019ve explored all the sides of the hallway, backtrack until you find a way out.",
