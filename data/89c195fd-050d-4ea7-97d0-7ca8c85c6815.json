  "output": "One example of a business that has successfully used creative marketing tactics is Nike. They have used celebrity endorsements, creative advertising campaigns, and clever product placements to increase brand awareness and reach new customers. For example, in 2019 they launched the \"Dream Crazy\" campaign featuring athlete Colin Kaepernick, which created a lot of buzz and earned them a lot of attention. Nike was also one of the first companies to introduce online shopping for their customers.
