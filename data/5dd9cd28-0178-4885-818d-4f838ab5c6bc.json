  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a street singer who travelled around the city singing her heart out, even when the city slept. She had a beautiful voice and a strong sense of determination, as she kept singing even when people were too busy to listen. Everywhere she went, she left behind a trail of hope, beauty and love. Her voice brought joy and peace to even the darkest places in the city, until one day she disappeared without a trace.",
