  "input": "",
  "output": "Humans are more advanced than primates in many ways, including their capacity for abstract thought, development of societies, and tool use. Humans have smaller canines, which is an indication of less aggression and a greater ability to chew and digest food. Humans also have larger brains than primates, and they have a greater capacity for meaningful language and communication. In addition, humans have the recognizable trait of bipedalism, enabling more efficient travel over longer distances.",
