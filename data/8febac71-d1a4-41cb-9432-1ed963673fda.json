  "input": "",
  "output": "Osmosis is the process by which molecules of a solvent, such as water, move through a semi-permeable membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The movement of water molecules is driven by differences in the solute concentration levels on either side of the membrane. As the solute concentration of one side of the membrane becomes greater than the other, the solvent molecules will move from the less concentrated side toward the more concentrated side until equilibrium is reached.",
