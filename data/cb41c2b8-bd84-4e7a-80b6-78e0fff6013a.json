  "output": "The claim that AI could never replace humans in creative response tasks is incorrect. While AI does not have the capacity for free-flowing creativity and originality, it is capable of learning from examples which allow it to create new solutions that have never existed before. For example, Generative Adversarial Networks have been trained to generate new images and artistic styles that can be indistinguishable from traditional artwork. Additionally, AI is also capable of filtering data and learning from user feedback, making it possible for AI-generated content to achieve a certain level of personalization and creativity.",
