  "instruction": "Given a user query, find out which of the following sources has the most accurate information about the query and explain why.",
  "input": "Query: What is the history of the internet?\nSources:\n1) A blog post\n2) Wikipedia article\n3) A book",
  "output": "The source that has the most accurate information about the query is the Wikipedia article. This is because Wikipedia articles undergo rigorous fact-checking and review before they are published, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, Wikipedia contains hyperlinks to sources that can be used to back up any claims and assertions, providing additional reliability. In comparison, blog posts and books often contain subjective and opinionated information which cannot be verified or authenticated, making them less reliable sources of information.",
