  "output": "It\u2019s a feeling of comfort in the unknown,\nOf strength and courage even when alone.\nA promise of joy, a bright and better day,\nThat will always be there, no matter what may. \n\nIt\u2019s a sign of change, a call to choose,\nTo realize that anything is possible if we have the courage to move.\nIt\u2019s the spark of light to guide us through the night,\nThe beacon of hope that will help us to make everything right. \n\nFor times of distress, of fear and of pain,\nHope will persevere, never broken or in vain.\nSo no matter what, never forget the source of your strength,\nFor hope will guide you on even the longest of lengths.",
