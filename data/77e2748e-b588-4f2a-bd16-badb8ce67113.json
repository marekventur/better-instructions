  "output": "The human ear is made up of three parts: the outer, middle and inner ear. The outer ear is comprised of the auricle (pinna), the external auditory canal, and the tympanic membrane (eardrum). The middle ear consists of three ossicles (the malleus, incus and stapes) which attach to the tympanic membrane and connect to the inner ear. The inner ear consists of the cochlea, a fluid-filled structure that helps to convert sound waves into signals that are sent to the brain.",
