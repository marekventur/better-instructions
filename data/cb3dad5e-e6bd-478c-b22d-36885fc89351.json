  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a young man who woke up one day to find that time had stopped. He searched far and wide for the source of this strange phenomenon, but no matter how hard he looked, he could not find the answer. He asked within his village but the people only shook their heads in bewilderment. He even visited a powerful wizard who, after thoughtful consideration, suggested a single solution- he must travel to the far side of the world, to a place called the Valley of Time. With nothing to lose, the young man embarked on his journey and, sure enough, found the Valley of Time. There he saw a beautiful clocktower, tall and majestic and ticking away time with its soft, muffled chimes. To this day, it is said that the clocktower holds the secrets of time, and all who dare to try can unlock it, if they are brave enough.",
