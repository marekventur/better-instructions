  "output": "Relativity is the idea that physical phenomena (such as space and time) depend on the observer's reference frame. This means that the same event or measurement can be experienced differently depending on the observer's motion or speed, or the gravitational force affecting them. \u00a0\u00a0 Albert Einstein's theory of relativity proposed two postulates - the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity. According to the Special Theory of Relativity, the laws of physics are the same in any inertial frame of reference, and in accordance with the General Theory of Relativity, the motion of an observer relative to the speed of light (or any other physical quantity) is affected by the presence of mass.",
