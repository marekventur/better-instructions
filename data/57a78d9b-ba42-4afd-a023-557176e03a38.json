  "output": "Here are some safety tips to remember when swimming in open water:\n- Make sure to always swim with a buddy and in an area that is supervised by a lifeguard. \n- Know the local swimming conditions and state water regulations.\n- Always be aware of potential dangers like current, wave action, marine life, and changing weather patterns. \n- When swimming in cold water, wear a wetsuit to help keep your body temperature warm. \n- Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids and take regular breaks to stay comfortable in the water.\n- Listen to safety flags placed on the beach. Red flags indicate strong waves, currents, rips or other hazardous conditions, and swimming outside the flags is prohibited. \n- If you are swimming far from shore, carry a signaling device and a light for night swimming to alert shoreside rescuers and boaters. \n- In general, children should not swim alone, regardless of the swimming condition.",
