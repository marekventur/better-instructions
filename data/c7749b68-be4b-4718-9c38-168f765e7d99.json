  "input": "",
  "output": "Integral calculus is built on the concept of finding the area under or between curves on a graph. It provides a way to calculate the total sum of all infinitesimally small sections of a curve. This is accomplished by breaking up a given interval into smaller sub-intervals and adding up the areas of all the sub-intervals.",
