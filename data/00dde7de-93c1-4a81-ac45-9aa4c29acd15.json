  "output": "Once upon a time there lived a farmer named Tom. Tom lived in a small rural village, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. He had been a farmer all his life, tending to his land and crops with the same determination and passion that his father and grandfather had before him. \n\nTom was up early each morning, tending to his plants in the dewy morning sun. He kept a close eye on his crops and was always ready to jump into action should any pests or weather disrupt his harvest. All the villagers knew him as a hard worker and reliable provider, and would often come to him for advice if the need arose.\n\nTom was happiest when he was surrounded by nature. He'd take his dog for a walk in the nearby woods, or watch the sun rise with a cup of coffee in his hand. Life in the village was peaceful and uncomplicated, and it suited him just fine. On a clear night he'd gaze at the stars, feel the stillness of his surroundings, and be reminded how lucky he was.\n\nTom was content with his simple life, and he didn't need much else to feel whole. When storms and difficulties came his way, he faced them head on with resilience and courage. As long as he had his farm and nature, he was a happy man.",
