  "output": "Machine learning and deep learning are two broad categories of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allow machines to process data and make decisions without explicit instructions. At their core, both machine learning and deep learning utilize algorithms, or mathematically structured models, to identify patterns in data and draw conclusions from them.\n\nThe main difference between the two lies in their approach to problem-solving. Machine learning approaches problems through a set of parameters or rules that are applied to the data. Deep learning, on the other hand, uses a network of interconnected layers that are accessed and influenced by each other, resulting in \u201cdeeper\u201d learning.\n\nBoth machine learning and deep learning can be used to generate predictive models and can be trained on a variety of datasets. However, deep learning generally requires more data than machine learning in order to build an accurate model and tends to outperform machine learning when large quantities of data are available.",
