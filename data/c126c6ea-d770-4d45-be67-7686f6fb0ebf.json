  "output": "Martin and Sarah were always seeking an adventure. So when they heard of an abandoned house in the countryside, they decided to explore it. As they stepped into the house, they noticed cobwebs everywhere, almost as if the house had not been touched in years. Suddenly, they heard what sounded like a door creaking, so they headed towards it. Opening the door, they were astonished by what they saw. An ancient Egyptian tomb was hidden beneath the house with hieroglyphics lining the walls. They soon realized they had stumbled upon an ancient mystery--one that few people ever even knew existed. With a sense of curiosity and excitement, they began to explore the tomb, hoping to uncover a secret that had been kept for centuries.",
