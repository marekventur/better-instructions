  "input": "",
  "output": "Mars and Earth are both planets in the Solar System. Mars is smaller than Earth, with a diameter of 6,779 kilometers compared to Earth's 12,742 kilometers. Mars also has weaker gravity than Earth, meaning objects weigh less on its surface than on Earth. Mars has a much colder climate than Earth, and also lacks surface water and an ozone layer to protect its atmosphere.",
