  "output": "The code finds the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to n. The function first assigns the value of n to x, which is the smallest possible multiple of n. Then, a while loop is used to continually increment x by n until the isDivisible(x, n) condition is met. This means that x is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to n, and thus it is the smallest multiple of n.",
