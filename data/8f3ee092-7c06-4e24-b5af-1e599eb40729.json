  "input": "",
  "output": "A tree is a data structure composed of nodes, each of which contains data, a list of references to other nodes (child nodes), and a reference to its parent node. It is said to be Turing-complete if it can be used to represent any computable function or if it can be used to store and manipulate any data structure. A tree can also be said to be finite if its nodes are arranged in such a way that only one path can be taken from any node to any other node. In a tree, each node can have as many references to child nodes as it desires, but a child node can only have one reference to its parent node. An empty tree is a tree which has no nodes.",
