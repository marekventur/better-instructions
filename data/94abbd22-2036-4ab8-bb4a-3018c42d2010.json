  "output": "Once upon a time, there were two friends named Joe and John who had known each other since they were small children. They had been together through thick and thin and shared a deep sense of friendship and camaraderie. \nOne day, Joe came up with an idea to start a business together that would help people find and purchase the items they wanted at the best prices. John was unsure of the idea at first, but as Joe explained it further, he slowly became more and more excited about the possibilities. \nAfter months of hard work, Joe and John opened their business and it quickly grew in popularity. The two of them were so proud of the venture, and their friendship only grew stronger as they celebrated their success.\n\nYears later, when life had taken each of them in different directions, the two old friends had the opportunity to reunite. They could still talk for hours like they had done when they were young, but now, they could reminisce about the good times they had shared while running the business. \nSuch was the strength of their friendship: no matter how much time passed or how far away they were, they could always find each other and reconnect over their shared experiences.",
