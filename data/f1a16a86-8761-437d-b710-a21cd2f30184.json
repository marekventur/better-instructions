  "output": "The mascot for the virtual assistant should be friendly, personable and easy to recognize. A cartoon robot is a suitable choice since robots are associated with technology and artificial intelligence. The mascot can be designed with a fun and lively personality to reflect the personality of the assistant. Its colors should reflect the company's branding, and it should have enough detail for users to recognize it easily.",
