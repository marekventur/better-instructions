  "input": "",
  "output": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computing system that is structured like a human brain. It uses multiple layers of neurons and connections between the neurons to solve complex tasks through learning from its environment. A GPT model, on the other hand, is a type of natural language processing model that is trained on a large corpus of text and relies on set language rules to generate its output. GPT models can generate natural language responses to questions and can also be used for tasks such as translation and summarization.",
