  "output": "It was a cold winter night, and the only sound in the woods was the howling of the cold wind. The moon shone through the trees, providing some light in the otherwise dark landscape. I walked slowly through the snow, my boots crunching with each step I took. As I pushed through a particularly thick patch of trees, a faint light caught my eye, and I followed it, curious to find out what could be out here in the middle of the night. When I made it to the clearing, I saw the source of the light - a small cabin, with a warm, inviting fire glowing in the fireplace. I smiled to myself, and went to knock on the door.",
