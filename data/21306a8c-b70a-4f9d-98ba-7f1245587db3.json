  "input": "",
  "output": "A system should be created for amplifying user feedback to ensure that users\u2019 ideas and suggestions are heard and taken into account. The system should involve collecting user feedback from various sources, including surveys, social media, and customer reviews. The collected feedback should then be sorted and organized into categories for easy access. Next, a knowledge database should be created to store and document the feedback that is potentially useful for the organization. Finally, an automated system should be developed to alert the relevant stakeholders whenever new feedback is available.",
