  "output": "One ethical solution to the problem of data privacy is to implement an opt-in data collection policy. This means that companies cannot collect and use personal data without the explicit permission of the data owners. This approach gives users the power to determine which data companies can use and for what purpose. Companies should also be transparent about how they use the collected data, so that users can make informed decisions and have control over their own data.",
