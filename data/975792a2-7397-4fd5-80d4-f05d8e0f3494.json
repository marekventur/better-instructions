  "output": "To make a paper plane, start by folding the top corners of a rectangular piece of paper so they meet in the middle. Then, fold the paper in half lengthwise. Next, fold the corners of the folded paper inwards until they touch the center crease. After that, unfold the paper, and fold the top corners of the paper towards the center. Finally, fold the paper in half, and then make two small folds on the wings to give them a curved shape. Now your paper plane is ready to be flown!",
