  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a fox, dog, and rabbit who all lived in the same forest. The fox was sly and always looking to outsmart the other animals, while the dog was friendly and always looking to have fun. The rabbit was timid and always trying to avoid the other animals. One day, the fox saw the dog and rabbit playing together in the forest and came up with a plan to get the two to fight. So, the fox tricked the dog and rabbit into thinking the other was out to get them and soon enough the two were at each other's throats trying to settle the score. The fox thought it was hilarious, but eventually the dog and rabbit saw his plan and put aside their differences to teach him a lesson.",
