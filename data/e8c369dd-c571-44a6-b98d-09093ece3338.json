  "output": "A conflict and its resolution refers to the process by which a disagreement between two or more parties is brought to an end. Conflict resolution can involve a negotiation process in which all parties work together to understand their issues and come to a mutually agreed upon solution. Resolution of a conflict requires collaboration and compromise, as well as recognition of each other's needs and wants. The resolution of a conflict should provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction for all those involved.",
