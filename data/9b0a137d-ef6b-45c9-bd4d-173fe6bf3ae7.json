  "instruction": "Imagine a situation in which two people have a conflicting viewpoint and explain how you would resolve their disagreement.",
  "input": "The two people have a disagreement about whether the speed limit should be lowered on a certain stretch of road.",
  "output": "In this situation, I would suggest inviting both of the individuals to a discussion. During this discussion, I would ask each person to explain why they feel their current viewpoint is the most appropriate in regards to safety and state regulations. The conversation should be held in a respectful and unbiased manner, allowing both people to voice their opinion. After listening to both perspectives, I would suggest a compromise that strives to make both people feel that their opinion is acknowledged and balanced with the other's viewpoint.",
