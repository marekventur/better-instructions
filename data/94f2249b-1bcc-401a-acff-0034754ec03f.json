  "input": "",
  "output": "The phrase \"life is not a race\" implies that life is not a competition and that one should not only focus on reaching certain goals as quickly as possible. Instead, it encourages one to take one's time and enjoy the journey, as life is more of a personal journey than it is a race against others. It is important to focus on living life to its fullest and doing things that bring positive experiences and meaningful connections rather than simply chasing after targets with a sense of urgency and haste.",
