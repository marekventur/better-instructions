  "instruction": "Calculate the roots of the equation x**2 - 4x + 3 = 0",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The roots of the equation can be calculated using the quadratic formula. The roots are equal to (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b**2 - 4ac))/2a, where a is the coefficient for x**2, b is the coefficient for x and c is the constant. In this case, a = 1, b = -4 and c = 3. Therefore, the roots of the equation are x = 3 and x = 1.",
