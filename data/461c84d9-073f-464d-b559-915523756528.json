  "input": "",
  "output": "You could use both colors in the room by having a blue wall as the main color, and then accessorizing with pink accents like bedding, throw pillows, and rugs. You could also try a two-tone wall in which the top half is pink and the bottom half is blue. For an even bolder look, you could paint all four walls in a pink and blue ombre gradient.",
