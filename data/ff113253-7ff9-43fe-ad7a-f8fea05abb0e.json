  "input": "",
  "output": "Gravitational lensing is an effect caused by the warping of space-time due to a massive object in space. Light that travels near the object is bent, causing the light to appear to come from different directions than it originally did. This phenomenon is a result of the bending of light due to the curvature of space-time. It can produce a magnified or demagnified image of the original source or a completely different image altogether.",
