  "input": "The maximum speed of a Cheetah is 120 km/h, which is greater than the maximum speed of a Greyhound, which is 75km/h.",
  "output": "The Cheetah is known as the world's fastest land mammal, and its top speed of 120 km/h makes it a force to be reckoned with. Such speed is far greater than that of the Greyhound, known as the fastest domesticated dog, which can reach speeds of only up to 75 km/h. Cheetahs have evolved over many years, adapting an incredible ability to dart across the plains faster than any other creature.",
