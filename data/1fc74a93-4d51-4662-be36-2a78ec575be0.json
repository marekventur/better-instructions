  "output": "Linear regression is a statistical method used to predict the value of a dependent variable (outcome) based on one or more independent variables (inputs). It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables, so that a straight line can be drawn to represent the data. This helps to understand how change in one variable affects the other and to make predictions accordingly.",
