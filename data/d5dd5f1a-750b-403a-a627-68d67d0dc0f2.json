  "input": "",
  "output": "The basic principles of strength training include progressive overload, specificity, periodization, and rest and recovery. Progressive overload involves gradually increasing resistance to challenge the body and promote muscle growth. Specificity requires selecting exercises that target particular muscles or goals. Periodization requires structuring exercise sessions with varying intensity and volume to maximize results. Rest and recovery are important to time to let muscles rebuild and avoid overtraining.",
