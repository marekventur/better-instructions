  "output": "Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived an old woman who took care of a cornfield. Each day she would visit the field and was startled to see a scarecrow there. She never quite figured out who planted it there or why it was there. But one day, to her surprise, the scarecrow suddenly came to life. He asked the old woman his name and she gave him the name Thomas. \n\nThomas was a clumsy but friendly scarecrow, who quickly became popular among the villagers. He kept watch over the cornfield and was often seen singing and dancing in the moonlit night. The old woman came to accept him as a companion and Raymond became a beloved figure in the village. He was known for his helpful nature and wise counsel to the villagers when they ran into trouble or needed advice. But sadly, one day, a heavy storm came and blew Thomas away. He was never seen again and the old woman was left with a piece of her heart missing.",
