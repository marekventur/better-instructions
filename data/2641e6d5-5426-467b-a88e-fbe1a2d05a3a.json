  "input": "",
  "output": "Chatbots are a popular choice for customer service, as they are able to provide immediate responses to customer inquiries without the need for human intervention. They can also assist customers in navigating through a website, provide product or service information, and even take orders. Additionally, chatbots can also help to reduce costs, as they are able to handle simple customer queries quickly and without the need for manual labor. However, due to their limited capabilities, chatbots cannot handle more advanced or unusual queries, or handle customer complaints or difficult issues. As such, customer service teams need to be prepared to handle these types of queries.",
