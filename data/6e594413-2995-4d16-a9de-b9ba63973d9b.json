  "instruction": "Determine the diameter of a sphere with a volume of 6.9 cubic meters",
  "input": "No input",
  "output": "The diameter of a sphere with a volume of 6.9 cubic meters can be determined by using the formula for the volume of a sphere, \\(V = {\\frac{4}{3}}\\pi r^3\\). By substituting 6.9 for the volume and solving for \\(r\\), the radius of the sphere is 3.27 meters. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 6.54 meters.",
