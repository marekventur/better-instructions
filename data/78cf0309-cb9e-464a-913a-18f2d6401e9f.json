  "input": "",
  "output": "A Tower of Hanoi algorithm consists of three steps. \n1. Move the largest disk to the other peg. \n2. Move the remaining disks to the other peg in a legal order. \n3. Move the largest disk back to its starting peg. \n\nTo complete the algorithm, you must first define how to move a disk and how to identify when a move is legal. You can then use the three steps mentioned above to complete the algorithm.",
