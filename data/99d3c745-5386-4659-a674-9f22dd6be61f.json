  "input": "",
  "output": "A programming language should have the basics of expression and statement syntax, control flow, functions, data types and type safety, classes, objects & inheritance, and error or exception handling. Additionally, the language should be able to integrate with other languages, support libraries and frameworks, and have effective debugging and profiling tools. It should also come with a proper compiler and interpreter as well as effective memory management to maximize performance.",
