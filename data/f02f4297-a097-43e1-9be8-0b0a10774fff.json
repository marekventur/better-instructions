  "instruction": "What are the four different language categories?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The four different language categories are analytic languages, agglutinative languages, fusional languages, and polysynthetic languages. Analytic languages are characterized by short words and mostly regular grammar rules. Agglutinative languages use suffixes, prefixes and infixes to convey meaning. Fusional languages have a high degree of overlap in meaning between different parts of speech. Finally, polysynthetic languages are characterized by very long words that often convey complex ideas with a single word.",
