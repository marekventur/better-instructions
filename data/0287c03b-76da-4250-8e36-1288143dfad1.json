  "instruction": "Outline the differences between a neuron and an artificial neuron.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A neuron is a biological cell that processes and transmits information in the nervous system. Neurons have three main components: dendrites, a cell body, and an axon. Dendrites receive information from other neurons, the cell body processes the information, and the axon transmits the information to other neurons.\n\nAn artificial neuron is an algorithm that simulates the behavior of a biological neuron. An artificial neuron receives multiple inputs and combines them via an activation function to produce a single output. It can also be trained with a learning algorithm to adjust its weights according to external inputs. Artificial neurons are used in neural networks and deep learning algorithms.",
