  "output": "Biodiversity is essential to the health of the planet. It is the variety of living organisms and how they interact with each other that helps to maintain healthy ecosystems and give humans the resources they need. Biodiversity helps to protect us against the risks posed by climate change, natural disasters, and disease. It also provides us with the raw materials to produce food, medicines, fuel, and clothing, while creating beautiful and unique habitats that support life on land and in the oceans. Protecting biodiversity is essential if we want to ensure a healthy future for all species.",
