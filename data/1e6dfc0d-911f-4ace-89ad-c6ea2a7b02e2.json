  "output": "The most pressing global health challenge facing us today is the spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and flu. These are among the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for more than a third of all mortality. In addition, these diseases have a large economic impact, as they cause an estimated annual global economic cost of US $2 trillion. Other health challenges, such as malnutrition, non-communicable diseases, and environmental health risks, are also important and need to be addressed.",
