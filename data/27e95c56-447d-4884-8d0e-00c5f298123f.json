  "input": "",
  "output": "Photosynthesis is a process by which plants use sunlight and carbon dioxide to produce energy. During the process, plants take in carbon dioxide and convert it into energy-producing carbohydrates like glucose. Respiration, on the other hand, is when living organisms use the energy produced in photosynthesis to generate energy for their own use. Unlike photosynthesis, respiration consumes oxygen as well as glucose and releases carbon dioxide.",
