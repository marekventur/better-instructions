  "input": "",
  "output": "Renewable energy sources are essential for a sustainable and green future. They are clean, reliable, and have no harmful emissions, meaning they do not contribute to global warming. These sources of energy also provide a variety of benefits, from generating jobs, reducing energy costs, and helping to protect biodiversity. Additionally, renewable energy sources are much less expensive than their non-renewable counterparts over the long term, making them a better investment. Furthermore, countries and states that invest in renewable energy sources can gain increased autonomy and independence when it comes to their energy needs.",
