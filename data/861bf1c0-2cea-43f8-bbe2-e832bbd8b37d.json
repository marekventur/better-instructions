  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used to improve customer service. AI can be used to automate customer service tasks such as answering basic questions. This frees up customer service agents to focus on more complex inquiries and interpersonal issues that require human interaction. AI can also be used to personalize customer service by making customer interactions more conversational and understanding customer needs through the use of natural language processing. AI can also be used to analyze customer feedback to better understand the customer's experience and thus improve customer service.",
