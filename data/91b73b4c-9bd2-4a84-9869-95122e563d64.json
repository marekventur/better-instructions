  "output": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water through the environment that never stops. Water can take the form of a liquid, solid or gas as it moves through the different stages of the cycle. The water cycle begins with evaporation, which is when the sun heats up the surface of water bodies, forcing liquid water to change state and vaporize into the air. The moisture in the air then turns into clouds and forms precipitation, such as snow, hail, and rain, which falls back to the surface of the Earth. Some of the water is absorbed into the ground and accumulates as groundwater, and the rest runs into rivers and streams, returning back to water bodies such as oceans, lakes, and reservoirs. The cycle continues as the water from these bodies heats up and evaporates again, starting the cycle anew.",
