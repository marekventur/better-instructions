  "output": "Natural selection is a process by which organisms that are better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and pass on their beneficial characteristics to their offspring. This process occurs over many generations, with each generation of organisms adaptively modifying their physical, chemical or behavior characteristics to better fit the environment. Over time, these adaptations allow certain populations of organisms to survive and reproduce.",
