  "input": "",
  "output": "The sun is essential for photosynthesis. Sunlight provides the energy for photosynthesis, a process in which plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and glucose. The sun's ultraviolet radiation helps to energize the reaction centres within a plant\u2019s cells, which drives the photosynthetic process. The sun's light also provides the wavelength of light that plants use to absorb and use the energy they need.",
