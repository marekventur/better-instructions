  "input": "![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/1vPws7V.png)",
  "output": "This design could be improved by making the font bigger and bolder so that it is easier to read. Additionally, you could use different colors for each section to make it easier to distinguish one from another. The lines separating the sections could also be thicker or colored differently. Finally, using a simpler design with fewer sections may help give the design more clarity and balance, while making it more visually appealing.",
