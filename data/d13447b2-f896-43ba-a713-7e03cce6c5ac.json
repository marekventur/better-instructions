  "output": "The sun shines bright up in the sky,\nThe town is still and peaceful nigh.\nThe days are lazy and long,\nThe nights are filled with a joyful song.\n\nThe meadows lush and green,\nThe river charts an ever-changing scene.\nThe air is warm and balmy,\nThe woodlands filled with a heavenly symphony.\n\nThe old church steeple looms,\nAmidst the fragrant fields of blooming blooms.\nThe children laugh and play\nAs sunlight glitters through the day.\n\nThis is what summer's like in a rural town,\nWhere all is peaceful and the days run down.\nIt's a blissful place of harmony and joy,\nWhere time is forgotten and worry is destroyed.",
