  "output": "Technology can be used in a variety of ways to improve the education system. Three such ways include: \n\n1. Using Educational Technology (edtech) tools such as adaptive learning programs and online tutoring. These tools help create a personalized learning experience for students, delivering content and assessments tailored to their individual level of understanding.\n\n2. Implementing virtual classrooms, allowing students to use their laptops, tablets, and smartphones to connect to teachers and teachers to connect to each other. This technology helps create an inclusive and interactive learning environment, wherein students can collaborate with their peers and ask questions in real time. \n\n3. Incorporating gamification into classrooms. This refers to the use of game elements and mechanics in non-game contexts. By introducing elements of games, such as rewards and levels, this technology increases student motivation and engagement, allowing students to learn more effectively.",
