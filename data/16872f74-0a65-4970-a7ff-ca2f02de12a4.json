  "output": "To make peanut butter cookies, you will need the following ingredients: 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of peanut butter, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1 and 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.\n\nTo make the cookies, start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Next, stir in the peanut butter, egg, and vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients until a smooth dough forms. Use a spoon to scoop the cookie dough and roll it into a ball. Place the cookie dough balls onto an ungreased baking tray and press down lightly with a fork to flatten them. Bake the cookies for 10-15 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool before serving. Enjoy!",
