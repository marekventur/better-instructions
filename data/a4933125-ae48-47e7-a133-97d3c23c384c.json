  "instruction": "Explain why quantum computers are more powerful than traditional computing systems.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The power of quantum computers comes from their ability to work on multiple calculations simultaneously. Unlike traditional computers, which process data one bit at a time, quantum computers can compute multiple bits at the same time. This allows them to work much faster than traditional computers, as well as store more data in a smaller space. Additionally, quantum computers have the potential to solve extremely complex problems that are too difficult for traditional systems.",
