  "output": "Ocean acidification is a global issue of increasing concern, caused by the ocean\u2019s absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It is reducing the pH level of the ocean, which has serious consequences for the ocean\u2019s environment and the species it supports. These impacts include reduced biodiversity, disruption to food webs, decreased coral reef resilience, and changes to other ocean chemistry that can prevent some species from forming shells. To mitigate the effects of ocean acidification, it is essential to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, through limiting the burning of fossil fuels.",
