  "input": "",
  "output": "As a servant of a noble household in colonial India, my daily routine would typically start with warming up the house by lighting a fire and preparing tea for the household. After that, I would feed the animals and perform household tasks such as washing and cleaning. I was responsible for organizing the kitchen and making sure the food was ready for the noble family's meals. Throughout the day I would carry out various duties such as attending to guests, running errands, and fetching supplies from the local market. In the evening, I would set up the bedding and make sure the furniture in the house was properly arranged before settling in for the night.",
