  "instruction": "Identify the potential issue with the following argument.",
  "input": "Increasing the minimum wage will benefit workers in the long run.",
  "output": "The potential issue with the argument is that it does not take into account any potential disadvantages of raising the minimum wage. There may be unintended consequences such as businesses raising prices to offset their increased labour costs, resulting in higher cost of living for the consumer. This could ultimately lead to decreased demand for goods and services, resulting in fewer jobs available for the workers in the long run.",
