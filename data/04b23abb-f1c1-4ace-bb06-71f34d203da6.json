  "output": "The protagonist was walking in an unfamiliar forest when she stumbled across a giant door. She felt a strange pull towards the door, as if it was calling out to her. She examined the door and noticed that it had a keyhole, but no key. Just as she was about to turn away, something glinted in the corner of her eye. A small, gold key lay in the grass. She cautiously picked it up and cautiously inserted the key into the keyhole. To her surprise, the door swung open with a loud creak. She stepped through the door, amazed at the wonders she would discover on the other side.",
