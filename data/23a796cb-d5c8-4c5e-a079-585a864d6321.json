  "output": "To design a basic algorithm of a game of rock-paper-scissors, you would start by defining the players and their choices. The two players will each choose either rock, paper, or scissors. A simple algorithm to define the winner could be created like so: \n\nif both players choose the same (rock, paper, or scissors)\n    then both players draw\n\nif one player chooses rock and the other player chooses scissors\n    then the player who chose rock wins\n\nif one player chooses scissors and the other player chooses paper\n    then the player who chose scissors wins\n\nif one player chooses paper and the other player chooses rock\n    then the player who chose paper wins",
