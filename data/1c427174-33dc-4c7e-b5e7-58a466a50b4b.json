  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to make education more accessible for everyone is to provide online educational resources that are freely available to anyone with an internet connection. By creating open source software, videos, podcasts, and other educational resources, anyone can access these materials at no cost and learn at their own pace. Additionally, providing subsidised access to educational technology such as laptop computers, tablets or other devices can give students of all backgrounds access to the knowledge and education they need.",
