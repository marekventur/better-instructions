  "input": "",
  "output": "Creating a budget is an important part of becoming financially responsible. First, students should identify their income sources such as their job or any scholarships or grants they are receiving. From there, they should list out their fixed expenses (rent, groceries, utilities, etc.), and then their variable expenses (clothing, entertainment, etc.). After that, they should calculate their total income and subtract their total expenses to see how much money is left over for savings or for other discretionary spending.",
