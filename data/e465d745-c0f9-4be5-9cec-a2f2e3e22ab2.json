  "input": "",
  "output": "Five ways to recycle plastic are by reusing and donating plastic items, looking for recyclable materials such as PET (polyethylene terephthalate), taking part in community clean-ups, joining an organization that works in plastic recycling, and creating art out of plastic. Reusing and donating plastic items is a great way to extend the lifetime of the plastic, reducing the need for further production. Looking for recyclable materials is important when recycling plastic, as different plastics require different process to be recycled and some are not recyclable at all. Joining a community clean-up can help to remove plastic from the environment and reduce the amount of plastic in the world. Joining organization that work in plastic recycling can help spread education and awareness on how to handle plastic correctly, and creating art out of plastic can be an imaginative way to reuse plastic and reduce it from the environment while supporting creativity.",
