  "input": "The dangers of electronic waste",
  "output": "Electronic waste, also known as e-waste, is waste that contains toxic materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium that can cause health problems and environmental issues when disposed of improperly. For example, when e-waste is burned, it releases harmful substances into the atmosphere, such as dioxins and carbon monoxide. Improperly disposed e-waste can also damage ecosystems by contaminating soil and water sources. Additionally, many of the components in e-waste can be recycled or repurposed so landfills aren\u2019t filled with potentially dangerous materials.",
