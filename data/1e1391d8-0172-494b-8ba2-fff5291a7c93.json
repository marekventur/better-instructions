  "instruction": "What technologies or processes could be used to solve the following problem: Public transport is too expensive and time consuming to use.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One possible solution is to use ride-sharing services or carpool, which can help reduce the cost of transportation. Additionally, technologies like autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, and predictive algorithms can be used to increase efficiency in public transit systems. Other innovations such as electric buses and public bike systems can also help to increase public transport efficiency and reduce costs.",
