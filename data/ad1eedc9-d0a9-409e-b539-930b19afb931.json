  "input": "",
  "output": "Yes, some programming languages are more complex than others. Generally, the more modern programming languages are more complex due to their added features and capabilities. Some languages, such as C and C++, are considered to be more complex because of their low-level capabilities and the need to use pointers and other advanced concepts. On the other hand, languages like Python and Java are generally easier to use due to their high-level abstractions and built-in features.",
