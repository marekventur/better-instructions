  "output": "Alice had been looking for her cat, Mr. Softy, all morning. She had searched under the bed, in the kitchen, in the garden. Everywhere she went, she called his name but he was nowhere to be found. \n\nAlice eventually decided to ask her neighbor, Mrs. Miller, if she had seen him. She knocked on Mrs. Miller's door and asked her politely, \u201cGood morning, Mrs. Miller. Have you seen my cat, Mr. Softy?\u201d \n\nMrs. Miller scratched her head and said, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t seen it. Is it a gray tabby with white spots?\u201d \n\nAlice was disappointed, but thanked Mrs. Miller for her help and walked away, still looking for her missing friend.",
