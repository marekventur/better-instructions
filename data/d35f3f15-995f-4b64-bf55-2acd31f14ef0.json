  "output": "A mathematical model to predict house prices can be created by considering the following factors: size, location, condition, and other environmental variables such as the availability of public services, proximity to employment centers, local crime rates, and local amenities. Data from these factors can be used to create a regression model that can accurately predict house prices.",
