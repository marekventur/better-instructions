  "input": "",
  "output": "The order of operations (also known as the PEMDAS or \"Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally\" rule) is a fundamental concept in mathematics. It describes how to solve complex math problems that contain multiple operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The basic idea is to solve the math problem in the correct order, starting with the most important operations first. The order of operations is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right) followed by Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).",
