  "input": "",
  "output": "Science fiction is a genre of literature that is relevant today because it often explores contemporary issues, such as environmental destruction and overpopulation, in imaginative and speculative ways. Through metaphors, science fiction allows us to examine political, social, and ethical questions by presenting them in story form, making them easier to think about and discuss. By speculating on the potential outcomes of current problems, science fiction allows us to explore possible solutions and plan for the future. It is an important genre of literature that shows us both the dangers of our present and helps us to imagine and create a better future.",
