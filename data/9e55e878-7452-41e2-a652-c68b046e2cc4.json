  "input": "",
  "output": "The orbital period of a planet is the length of time it takes for a planet to make one full orbit around its star. It is determined by measuring the time it takes between two successive passes of a planet by a particular point in its orbit, such as when it passes in front of its star. This is usually done using astronomical instruments such as telescopes and spectroscopes. Other factors such as the distance from the star and the planet's mass also affect its orbital period.",
