  "input": "",
  "output": "The five components of a disaster recovery plan are risk assessment and planning, data/application/system backups, emergency power, disaster notification/communication, and data storage redundancy. Risk assessment and planning involves identifying and mitigating potential risks such as natural disasters or power outages. Data and application backups both ensure that data and systems can be quickly restored. Emergency power plans for backup generators or alternative power sources in the event of a power outage. Disaster notification/communication outlines the procedures for notifying stakeholders in case of an emergency. Finally, data storage redundancy enables data storage to continue if primary storage systems fail.",
