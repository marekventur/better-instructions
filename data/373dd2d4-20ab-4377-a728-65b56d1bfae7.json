  "input": "",
  "output": "DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary material found in the cells of living organisms, and it is responsible for passing on genetic information from parents to their offspring. DNA is composed of two strands of nucleotides that are intertwined and held together by hydrogen bonds. It contains the instructions for the development and functioning of every living organism, and it is responsible for determining an organism's physical traits. In other words, DNA acts as the blueprint of an organism's form and functions, and it is what makes every living thing unique.",
