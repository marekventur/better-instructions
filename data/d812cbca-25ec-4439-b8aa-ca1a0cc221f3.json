  "input": "",
  "output": "Ocean acidification can have a serious impact on the environment, including negatively affecting marine ecosystems and the species that live in them. It can reduce species diversity, decrease habitat complexity, and limit the availability of calcium for marine organisms. It can also increase the toxicity of some pollutants and reduce the benefits of coral reefs. Additionally, ocean acidification can interfere with the growth and development of some marine species.",
