  "input": "",
  "output": "A laptop computer is a type of personal computer that is portable and can be used for activities such as work, school, and entertainment. Laptop computers are smaller and lighter than desktop computers and can be used on the go. Laptops are more expensive and have less power than desktop computers; however, laptops offer more portability, as they can be easily moved, and can be more convenient for activities such as online meetings, as users can use them anywhere. Desktop computers offer more power and are less expensive, but are not as portable as laptop computers.",
