Medication, such as antidepressants, can help to regulate moods and emotions, and to reduce symptoms of depression. Psychotherapy can help individuals to talk about their feelings and identify the factors that contribute to their depression, as well as providing strategies for managing symptoms. Finally, lifestyle changes, such as exercising and sleeping adequately, can also be helpful in treating depression.",
