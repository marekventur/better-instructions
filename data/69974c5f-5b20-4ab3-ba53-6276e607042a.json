  "output": "Dear Customer Service Team, \n\nI recently used your product delivery app and had an issue with it that I wanted to report. When I placed my order, the estimated delivery time was 2 hours, but the product did not arrive until 4 hours later. I understand that there could have been delays due to external factors, but I wanted to make you aware of the issue. \n\nI also wanted to note that the product itself was of excellent quality and I am very pleased with it. However, I believe it is important to stay true to our delivery estimations so as to ensure customer satisfaction.\n\nThank you for your help and for taking my feedback into consideration. I look forward to using your app again in the future.\n\nSincerely, \n[Name]",
