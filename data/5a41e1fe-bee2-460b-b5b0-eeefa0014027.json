  "output": "There are a number of ways to lower the rate of food spoilage. Proper food storage is one of the most important things one can do to reduce food spoilage; this includes storing food in airtight containers or bags in cool and dry places out of direct sunlight, properly wrapping food and removing any air from packages, and freezing or refrigerating foods. Additionally, one can practice portion-control and meal prepping, regularly check expiration dates and properly store food leftovers, and avoid buying more food than needed.",
