  "output": "In the morning before school, I usually get up early to get ready for the day. I like to take time to stretch and do some physical activity like running or push-ups to energize my body and mind. I have a quick breakfast to get my day started and then brush my teeth and get dressed. After that, I make sure to take a few moments to read something to get my brain in the right frame of mind for the day ahead. Finally, I'm ready to start my journey to school and classes.",
