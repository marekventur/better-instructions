  "input": "",
  "output": "A while loop is used to execute a set of statements repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Unlike a for loop, the number of iterations is not pre-defined and the condition is checked before each iteration. A for loop is used to execute a set of statements a defined number of times. The number of iterations is declared before entering the loop and the condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration.",
