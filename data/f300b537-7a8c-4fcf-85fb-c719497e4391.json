  "instruction": "Design an animation showing the process of photosynthesis.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The animation should begin with the sun shining, followed by energy-storing molecules called chloroplasts appearing. The chloroplasts act as tiny factories which turn sunlight into energy, while also taking in water and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The energy is then used to create sugars, which are stored in the plant as fuel. The animation should show this energy transformation process, followed by the plant releasing oxygen into the atmosphere as a by-product.",
