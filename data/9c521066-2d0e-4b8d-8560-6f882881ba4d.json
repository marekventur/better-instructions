  "input": "Student Name: John\nGrades: Math-C, History-D",
  "output": "John should create a plan to help him improve his grades in math and history. He should start by speaking to his teachers to understand what he could do to improve, and take advantage of any resources they may be able to provide. He should also set specific, achievable goals for himself and track his progress. He should also take advantage of any tutoring or extracurricular activities offered by his school to help him better understand the material. Finally, John should develop better study habits, such as breaking up his studying into smaller chunks and using study tools such as flashcards or practice problems.",
