  "input": "",
  "output": "Volcanoes are formed when molten rock called magma collects within the Earth's crust and then rises towards the surface. As the magma rises through the layers of the Earth, it encounters pressure change and chemical reactions with surrounding rocks, which causes chemical reactions and the magma to become molten lava. Lava then erupts through the Earth's surface causing a volcanic eruption.",
