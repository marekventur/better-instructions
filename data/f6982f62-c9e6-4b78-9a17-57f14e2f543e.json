  "input": "",
  "output": "One plan to reduce emissions from fossil fuels by 25% within the next five years is to invest heavily in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. This could be achieved through both public and private investment in infrastructure to build out renewable energy capacity and incentives to encourage businesses and households to switch to renewable energy sources. In addition, governments should increase regulations on the burning of fossil fuels and raise taxes on the production and consumption of fossil fuels. Lastly, public transit systems should be expanded and modernized to decrease the number of cars on the road and reduce individual's reliance on fossil fuels.",
