  "input": "",
  "output": "Divided government occurs when one party controls the presidency, and another party controls the legislature, or Congress. This can occur when one party gains a majority in one chamber of Congress, but the other chamber remains under control of the other party. This leads to a situation where the branches are unable to work together to pass legislation and the government is in a state of gridlock.",
