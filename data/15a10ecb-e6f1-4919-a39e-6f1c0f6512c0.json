  "output": "Education each day is such a trip,\nTakes us on a journey, take a sip,\nWithout school and teachers and a library,\nIt's like trying to fly with a broken wingery,\nOpportunity is a ready meal,\nRealize your dreams and make them real,\nSmart and steady see it unfold,\nAnd better yourself through books you hold.",
