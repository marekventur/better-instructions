  "output": "An emergency plan for dealing with an oil spill should involve a swift response in order to minimize the damage to the environment. First, containment and cleanup systems need to be set up as soon as possible to keep the oil from spreading. Spill booms can be used to contain the spread of the oil and skimming vessels can be used to remove the oil from the surface of the water. Next, the source of the spill must be determined and contained in order to prevent further leakage of oil. Finally, the affected area should be cleaned up, tested for environmental damage, and monitored for long-term effects.",
