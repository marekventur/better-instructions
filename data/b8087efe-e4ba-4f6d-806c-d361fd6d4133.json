  "output": "Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to talk about globalization - how it is impacting our world and our lives. Globalization is about connections between countries, cultures, and economies. It involves increased access to products, technology, ideas, and information. As a result, we can move goods and resources more quickly, share knowledge and best practices, and be more open to different cultures and customer markets. With globalization, the world is becoming more global, not just by geographical distances, but by connections that span between countries and communities.",
