  "instruction": "Design an experiment that tests the reaction of a tomato's growth to different kinds of water.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The experiment would involve planting tomatoes in different kinds of water, such as tap water, distilled water, and ocean water, and then observing their growth. Each group would have the same amount and types of nutrients, but only the type of water would be changed. The experiment could be further refined by also testing the tomatoes with different pH levels.",
