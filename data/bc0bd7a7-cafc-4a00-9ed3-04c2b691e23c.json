  "output": "It\u2019s been one year since the coronavirus pandemic began to affect the lives of people around the world. In the midst of massive lockdowns and social distancing, we managed to learn a few things about this virus. For starters, it is apparently very contagious, as it spread like wildfire around the globe. We have also come to realize though, that the virus only targets those who aren\u2019t following specific protocols. Wearing a face covering, washing your hands and staying home has proven to be the ultimate remedy \u2013 the only thing standing in the way of avoiding infection. Taking preventive measures has significantly reduced the spread of the virus, and yet, people are still getting sick. Is this virus selectively choosing who to infect? It just doesn\u2019t make sense! We may never know the answer, but at least we can attempt to stay safe and healthy.",
