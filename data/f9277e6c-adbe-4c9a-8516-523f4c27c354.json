  "input": "",
  "output": "Naive Bayes is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is based on Bayes\u2019 Theorem which uses the probabilities of previous events to predict the probability of future events. The Naive Bayes' assumption is that all the features of the data are independent, meaning that the probability of one feature is not affected by the presence of any other feature in the data. This type of classifier is often used in natural language processing tasks. It is also efficient in terms of training and predicting, making it a preferred choice for many applications.",
