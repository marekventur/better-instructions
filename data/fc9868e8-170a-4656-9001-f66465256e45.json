  "output": "The length of the hypotenuse in the triangle is 5.  To calculate this, we use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the other two sides have lengths of 3 and 4, so the hypotenuse must have a length of 5.",
