  "output": "The coronavirus pandemic has had an unprecedented effect on the US economy. As consumer spending shrank and businesses closed, unemployment jumped to 14.8%, its highest level ever recorded. Many industries have experienced deep losses, including the hospitality sector, which has seen a 40.6% drop in revenue compared to last year.
