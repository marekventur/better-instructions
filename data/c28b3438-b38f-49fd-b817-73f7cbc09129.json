  "input": "",
  "output": "Organizational structures that are rigid tend to have both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, this type of structure is often associated with greater efficiency since it clearly defines roles, responsibilities and authority levels. As such, communication is improved due to a clear chain of command and decision-making is faster given the command and control hierarchy. This type of structure is also less likely to experience confusion due to unclear direction and roles.\n\nOn the other hand, a rigid structure may lead to lower creativity and innovation. Employees may feel more restricted in their work and unable to contribute ideas or express opinions. This type of structure may also lead to bureaucratic barriers and decision-making may be too limited to certain individuals, such as managers at the top of the hierarchy. In addition, there may be a tendency for top-level executives to become less accountable for their decisions.\n\nOverall, rigid organizational structures can be beneficial for keeping operations efficient and communication clear, but can lead to lower creativity, political barriers and a lack of accountability.",
