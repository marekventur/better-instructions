  "output": "Recent data shows that despite record unemployment in the US, Americans are saving more money than ever. Personal savings rate hit 33%, the highest rate since the financial crisis in 2008, indicating that people are cautiously putting their money away for the future. Consumer spending is also declining, though at a slower rate than expected. As the unemployment rate reaches its highest levels of the last 50 years, it appears that households are preparing for an uncertain financial future.",
