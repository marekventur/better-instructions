  "instruction": "Design a webpage for online grocery shopping",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The website should be clean and easy to navigate, as well as functional, to ensure good and efficient shopping experience. Basic sections such as product categories, shopping cart and payment options should be straightforward with clear labeling. Color choice should be warm, with shades of gray and green to emphasize natural and freshness. Since the website should display a wide range of products, it should have an image-focused design with a product search feature to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for. Additionally, it should have an intermediary page for each product that describes its features, price, nutritional value and other helpful info.",
