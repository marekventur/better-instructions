  "output": "The human eye consists of the cornea, pupil, lens, retina, and aqueous and vitreous humour. The cornea is the transparent dome at the front of the eye. It helps the eye to focus light rays onto the pupil. The pupil is the dark opening in the center of the eye, allowing light to pass through. The lens is behind the pupil and helps to focus light onto the back of the eye. The retina is a thin layer of light-sensitive cells lining the inner surface of the eye. It is responsible for converting light into nerve impulses that then travel to the brain. The aqueous and vitreous humour are clear substances that fill the area between the lens and the retina. They help maintain the eye's shape and provide nutrients to the other structures of the eye.",
