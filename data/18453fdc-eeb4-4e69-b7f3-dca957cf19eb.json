  "input": "",
  "output": "The data dashboard can be constructed to compare sales figures across two different shops in the following manner:\n\n1. Create two separate graphs to compare the sales figures, one for each of the two shops.\n2. Include sales amount, region, and category in the graphical visualization to get a better understanding of the comparison between the two shops.\n3. Provide a table to highlight the differences and similarities between the shops with regards to sales, such as, total sales, average sales, highest and lowest sales, etc.\n4. Include a third graph that gives a wider perspective of overall sales performance across regions. \n5. Include an interactive map to compare the sales performance visually between the two shops. \n6. Finally, add a summary table to provide a general overview of the comparison between the two shops.",
