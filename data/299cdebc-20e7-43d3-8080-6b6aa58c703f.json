  "input": "",
  "output": "Genetic drift is a process by which a population's allele frequencies can change over time due to random chance. When allele frequencies change due to random chance it can cause adaptation, which is one of the four main mechanisms of evolution. Genetic drift can lead to the elimination of alleles from a population or to the fixation of beneficial alleles in a population, either of which can lead to evolution.",
