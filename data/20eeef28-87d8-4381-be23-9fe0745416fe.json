  "input": "",
  "output": "The planetary motions in the Solar System are governed by the laws of gravity and inertia. Every planet in the system orbits around the Sun in an elliptical path due to the gravitational pull of the Sun. This orbital motion is regulated by the laws of inertia, which states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. In addition, each planet has an axis of rotation and its own unique period of revolution around the Sun.",
