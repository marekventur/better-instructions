  "instruction": "Explain why the moon's appearance can vary each night.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The moon's appearance can vary from night to night because of its varying orbital position and its illuminated angle relative to the sun. The moon orbits the Earth every 27.3 days, sometimes in the same position but sometimes at a slightly different angle. As it orbits, the amount of moonlight visible to us on Earth increases or decreases. Additionally, what phase of moon we can see\u2014whether it is a full moon, waning moon, waxing moon, or new moon\u2014will also depend on its position.",
