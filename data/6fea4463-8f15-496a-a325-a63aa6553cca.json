  "output": "Data architecture is essential to the success of an AI system as it provides a structure on which the underlying AI algorithms can be built. It allows for efficient data organization and storage so that the AI system can effectively understand, process and utilize the required data. Moreover, a well-structured data architecture enables the system to quickly adapt to changes in data. This helps the system to remain agile, scale faster and provide more accurate and reliable results.",
