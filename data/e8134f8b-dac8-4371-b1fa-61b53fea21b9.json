  "input": "",
  "output": "An electrical circuit is a closed loop of conducting wires. When a source of electricity is connected to the circuit, such as a battery, current flows around the loop. This current is able to power electrical components, such as bulbs, within the circuit. The electricity also encounters any resistance components, such as a resistor, which cause the current to decrease. The current then returns to its source, completing the circuit.",
