  "input": "",
  "output": "The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is part of the Bill of Rights and protects the individual's right to keep and bear arms. It states that \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" It is one of the most contested amendments in the United States, as it is often used to justify either the rights to possess certain types of firearms or calls for stricter regulations of firearms. The Supreme Court has generally interpreted the Second Amendment as protecting an individual right to possess firearms, however, some states have passed laws restricting the types of firearms that can be legally owned.",
