  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the economic benefits of wind energy vs. solar energy.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The economic benefits of wind energy and solar energy differ in some ways. Wind energy can be more cost-effective than solar energy over its lifetime, since installation costs for wind turbines are lower, but solar energy is more efficient and can generate more power. Solar energy is also more consistent, since wind turbines rely on the availability of wind, while solar panels generate electricity from the sun even on cloudy days. Additionally, both are environmentally friendly and generate electricity at a lower cost compared to fossil fuels.",
