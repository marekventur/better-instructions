  "input": "",
  "output": "Grass-fed beef typically has fewer calories, less fat, and fewer negative environmental impacts than grain-fed beef. Grass-fed beef is higher in Omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, providing more health benefits than grain-fed beef. Additionally, grass-fed beef has a more pronounced flavor compared to grain-fed beef. Grass-fed beef can also be more expensive than grain-fed beef as it requires more resources to produce.",
