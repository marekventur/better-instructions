  "input": "",
  "output": "The key differences between a CV and a resume are length, structure, and content. A CV is typically longer than a resume, as it can include more information and cover more aspects of a person's life. A CV is usually structured differently, with more emphasis on highlighting skills, academic achievements, and research experience. Additionally, the content is typically tailored more towards academic positions or research jobs, while a resume is used for more general job searches.",
