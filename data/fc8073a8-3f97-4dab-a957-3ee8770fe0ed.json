  "output": "A black hole is an extremely dense region of space with an intense gravitational pull. It is formed by a collapsed star which has become so densely packed that nothing, not even light, can escape its powerful gravitational force. It is characterised by a singularity at its core, an invisible boundary known as the event horizon and an accretion disc surrounding the event horizon. Black holes are often associated with the supermassive monsters that exist in the centre of many galaxies.",
