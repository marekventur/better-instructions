  "input": "The input data consists of the customer's demographics, purchase history, and customer preferences.",
  "output": "I will build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms, such as na\u00efve bayes, support vector machines, and random forests, based on the available customer demographic, purchase history and customer preference data. The model will help predict the likelihood of customer purchase.",
