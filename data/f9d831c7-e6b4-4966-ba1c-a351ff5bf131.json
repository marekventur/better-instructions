  "input": "",
  "output": "Multitasking can improve productivity by allowing someone to switch between tasks quickly and efficiently. This can help to speed up the completion of tasks, as it eliminates the need for switching context in between tasks. Furthermore, multitasking allows for tasks to be divided between different people, thus freeing up time and resources that would have been spent on a single person completing the tasks. Additionally, in some cases it may not be necessary to start a task from scratch, which can save time and energy. Finally, multitasking can spread the workload over multiple people, which can help to balance the amount of work each person must complete.",
