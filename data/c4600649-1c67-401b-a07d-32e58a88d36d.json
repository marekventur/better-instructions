  "input": "Mathematics",
  "output": "In mathematics, basic equations are used to describe relationships between different variables. They are a simple way of representing how two or more objects interact with each other. For example, in a basic equation 2 + 4 = 6, the equation is showing that when two is added to four the result is six. Equations like this can be used to solve complex problems, as they are all based on the same principles. By understanding the fundamental concepts of equations, one can learn to apply them in more advanced scenarios and use them to their advantage.",
