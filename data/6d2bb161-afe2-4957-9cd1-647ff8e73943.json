  "input": "",
  "output": "The Earth is divided into four main layers. The innermost layer is the inner core, which is a solid iron-nickel alloy. The second layer is the outer core, which is mostly liquid iron and nickel. The third layer is the mantle, which is composed of molten rock surrounded by a solid rock called the crust. The fourth layer is the crust, which is the thin outermost layer and is composed of solid rocks. The inner core and outer core are both composed of liquid, whereas the mantle and crust are composed of solid materials.",
