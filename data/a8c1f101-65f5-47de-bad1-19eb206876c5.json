  "output": "The most efficient way for a beginner to get started in programming is to choose a language to learn, as different languages are suited for different tasks. Then, it's a good idea to find tutorials, whether online or in books, and take a class or two to give you an overview of the language and get some hands-on experience. Once you are familiar with the language, work on projects that allow you to practice what you have learned and gradually build up your skills in the language. Throughout your journey, don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions, seek advice, and make mistakes. With that attitude and dedication, you\u2019ll have programming skills in no time.",
