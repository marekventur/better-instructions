  "output": "The poem uses lyricism to capture the intensity of the wind and the weight of the speaker's worries. The image of the wind being so strong that it scatters the worries in the sky convey the speaker's feelings of helplessness. The growing size of the worries implies that they are increasing and becoming more difficult to manage.",
