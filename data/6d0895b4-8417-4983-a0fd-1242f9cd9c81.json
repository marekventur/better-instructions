Bread is often used as a vehicle for condiments or as a side dish. Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt are a staple in most households. Fruits and vegetables make up the bulk of a healthy diet and are often used to cook with or prepare snacks. Condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise are frequently used to enhance the flavor of a dish.
