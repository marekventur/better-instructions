  "input": "",
  "output": "Neural networks are particularly suitable for large-scale data processing because of their scalability. Neural networks are composed of interconnected layers of neurons, each layer capable of learning parameters for more accurate data representation and processing. By adding more layers, more complex data can be analyzed and represented more accurately. Furthermore, because neural networks are based on numerical processing, they can process large amounts of data quickly, making them suitable for large scale data processing.",
