  "output": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a shift in buying behavior in that more consumers are shopping online, having increased demand for delivery services, and setting up new preference for digital payment methods. Since the start of the pandemic, online shopping has seen a significant increase, with people buying essential items such as groceries, personal care items, electronics, and home and garden supplies online. Furthermore, delivery services have become increasingly important as people prioritize contactless delivery and order fulfillment.
