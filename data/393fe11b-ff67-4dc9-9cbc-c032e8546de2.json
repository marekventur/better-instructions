  "output": "Taking breaks can help boost productivity in many ways. It's natural to become mentally fatigued after a period of intense concentration, so taking a short break can help recharge the brain and make it easier to focus on the task at hand. Taking breaks can also help to reduce stress, which can be a major distraction when trying to stay productive. Breaks also can help to increase creativity by allowing us to look at our work from a fresh perspective when we come back. In short, taking regular breaks is essential for improving productivity and staying focused.",
