  "input": "",
  "output": "Schools should implement an honor code policy that outlines expected academic standards and procedures. All students should sign the code, which should address all forms of cheating, plagiarism and collusion, and also provide clear consequences. In addition, schools could also utilize advanced technologies to help detect plagiarism and cheating. Random checks of student work may also be introduced, along with anonymous reporting measures for students who want to report cheating.",
