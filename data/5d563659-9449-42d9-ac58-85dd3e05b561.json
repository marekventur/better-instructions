  "input": "",
  "output": "Mass and weight are related but different concepts. Mass is the amount of matter in an object, and is measured in kilograms. Weight is the force generated by gravity, and is measured in Newtons. The two are related since gravity exerts a force on objects with mass, and the greater the mass, the greater the weight.",
