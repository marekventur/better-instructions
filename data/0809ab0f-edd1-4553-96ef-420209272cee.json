  "output": "The poem \u201cI Hear America Singing\u201d by Walt Whitman is a celebration of the American spirit and of American democracy. It lists a variety of jobs people have, from farmers and boatmen to mechanics, carpenters, shoemakers, and so on. Each person is described \u201csinging\u201d a song, and Whitman juxtaposes the lowliest jobs with the highest and most intellectual. The poem suggests that America is strong because of its variety, and celebrates the workers of the nation.",
