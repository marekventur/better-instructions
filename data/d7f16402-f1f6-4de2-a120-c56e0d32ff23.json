  "input": "",
  "output": "The causes of poverty in low-income countries can be varied, but typically include lack of access to education, limited access to healthcare, limited access to resources, geographic location, government instability, and increased natural disasters. Additionally, many low-income countries are also experiencing population growth, which can lead to an increased demand on resources, making it difficult for those resources to be distributed among all citizens.",
