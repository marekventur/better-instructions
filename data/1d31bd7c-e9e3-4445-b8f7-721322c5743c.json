  "instruction": "Provide an argument why the Internet should remain neutral.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Net neutrality is essential for ensuring an open and competitive internet. Maintaining a neutral internet allows for a level playing field for individuals, organizations and businesses - it enables them to develop, distribute, and access content on their own terms. Conversely, if internet service providers (ISPs) can decide which content is more important or which websites are more advantageous, it would reduce user choice, create an internet where certain companies have an unfair advantage, and limit free expression online. Additionally, it could lead to higher costs for users who would be charged more for \"premium\" services. By keeping the internet neutral, it can remain an open platform where anyone can access the entire web.",
