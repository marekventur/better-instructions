  "input": "",
  "output": "Computers can be used to solve complex mathematics problems by utilizing algorithms that can quickly process and analyze large amounts of data. Computers can also be programmed to recognize patterns, meaning they can quickly identify any particular type of mathematical problem and provide an efficient solution. Additionally, some computers can be programmed to generate and explore multiple possible solutions in order to determine the optimal result.",
