  "input": "",
  "output": "Modernism is a cultural movement that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century, in which writers, artists, musicians, and other creatives sought to break from the traditional forms and conventions of the past, in order to produce works that addressed the realities of their own time. Modernism promoted a more subjective approach to art, expressed through abstraction, fragmentation, and experimentation, exploring new ways of thinking, feeling and creating art.",
