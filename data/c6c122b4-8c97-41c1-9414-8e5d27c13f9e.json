  "instruction": "Apply the KISS principle to a software design problem.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle can be applied to software design problems by simplifying the design to its most essential features. This involves reducing the complexity, time and effort required to develop, maintain or use the software. It means avoiding feature creep, where unnecessary features and complexity are added to the software design. It also means identifying the user's needs and ensuring the design meets them without any unnecessary components. KISS also encourages developers to focus on user experience, keeping the user interface simple and intuitive. By following the KISS principle, software designers can create systems that are easy to use, require minimal configuration and testing, and can be easily maintained.",
