  "output": "One natural language processing use case for an ecommerce website is using Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to interpret search queries. By using NLU, the website can understand the intent of the query, and return results based on that intent rather than the literal words. Additionally, NLU can be used to assist customers in finding the right product by helping to automatically classify the products and provide the user with relevant search results.",
