  "output": "Electric cars are a type of vehicle that runs on electricity instead of fossil fuels like gasoline. They provide an eco-friendly alternative to traditional cars as they do not emit harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Electric cars offer various benefits, such as reduced refueling costs, quicker acceleration, and improved range. However, the cost of these cars is still high, as is the purchase and installation of the necessary charging equipment. Electric cars are becoming increasingly popular, and with the right infrastructure and incentives, they could ultimately be a major part of the automobile industry.",
