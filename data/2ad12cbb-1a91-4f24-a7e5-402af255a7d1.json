  "output": "Plants are essential for the environment because they help maintain healthy habitats by providing food, oxygen, and shelter for wildlife. Additionally, plants play a crucial role in controlling soil erosion, reducing erosion losses and preserving water quality. Plants also absorb harmful toxins and pollutants released into the atmosphere and naturally filter them out. Lastly, they help to combat climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the air, using it to make food, and releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere.",
