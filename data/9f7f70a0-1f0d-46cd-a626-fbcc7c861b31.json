  "instruction": "Show how to stitch a simple embroidery pattern.",
  "input": "The pattern is a simple Bowtie design.",
  "output": "Start by drawing the design you want onto your fabric. Start with the vertical line and make a stitch from the top, downwards to the centre. Then, go back up to the top, and make a stitch to the left. Work the same stitch downwards, and then go back up, and make a stitch to the right. Make sure the stitches remain consistent and even. Once the vertical line is finished, start the horizontal line, and stitch across, following your pattern. As you move along, make sure to keep the stitches in line with the vertical line. To finish off, add one more stitch to the vertical line, and knot off at the end. Your embroidered bowtie is now complete!",
