  "output": "Trees are an excellent data storage structure with several advantages. They are fast to access and provide efficient search, insert, and delete operations, which makes them ideal when working with large datasets. Trees also have the capability of sorting information in an organized format, which reduces additional processing time for large data sets. Additionally, trees have low storage costs since their data structures are typically compact.",
