  "instruction": "Explain why it could be dangerous for an AI system to operate independently?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "There are several risks associated with an AI system operating independently. First, AI systems often lack the regulatory, ethical, and safety standards required to protect citizens. Additionally, AI systems are prone to errors and biases, which may lead to unexpected outcomes. Furthermore, unintended consequences can often arise from AI systems that lack the common sense and morality needed to make good decisions. Finally, there is a risk of AI systems becoming too powerful and leading to a 'doomsday' type scenario, which could gravely endanger humanity.",
