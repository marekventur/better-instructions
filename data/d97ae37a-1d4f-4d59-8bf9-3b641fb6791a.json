  "input": "",
  "output": "Two techniques for managing stress are mindfulness and exercise. Mindfulness involves taking a few moments throughout the day to practice active and intentional awareness of one\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. On the other hand, exercise involves physical activity such as running, biking, or swimming, which can help to reduce stress and tension. \n\nBoth techniques are effective in managing stress and anxiety, but there are some key differences between the two. Mindfulness focuses on being present in the moment and calming one\u2019s mind, while exercise provides a more physical release and outlet for stress. Additionally, mindfulness can be practiced anywhere and does not require any supplies, while exercise requires a certain level of physical fitness and access to equipment.",
