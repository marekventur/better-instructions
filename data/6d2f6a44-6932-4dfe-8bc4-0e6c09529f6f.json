  "input": "",
  "output": "The logo would be designed with a dove in a golden circle, with the words \"Peace Through Unity\" emblazoned underneath. The dove would signify peace, while the golden circle symbolizes unity, and the words in the middle would serve as a call to action. The colors used would be either gold and blue, or gold and green, to represent peace, unity and the hope of a brighter future.",
