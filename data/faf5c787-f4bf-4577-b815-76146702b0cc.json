  "instruction": "Describe the importance of hydroponics in modern gardening.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Hydroponics is an efficient and modern method of growing plants and vegetables without soil. Hydroponic systems use nutrient-rich water to ensure that plants get the proper nutrition they need to grow, and because the water is recycled, hydroponics uses a fraction of the water and fertilizer that traditional soil-based gardening requires. In addition, hydroponic gardens can grow in small, controlled environments, allowing gardeners to grow plants year-round without worrying about the effects of seasonal changes.",
