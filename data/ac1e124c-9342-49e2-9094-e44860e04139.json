  "output": "1. Keep the design simple and easy to navigate: Using too many fonts, colors, and images can be overwhelming for visitors and lead them to leave the page. Make sure to use a clear color palette and stick to one or two fonts. Additionally, the navigation buttons should be easy to find and the link structure should be simple and intuitive. \n2. Make the page SEO friendly: SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and is the practice of optimizing a web page to make it rank higher in search engine results. Make sure the page has understandable headings, quality content, relevant keywords, and high-quality images. Additionally, keep the page mobile friendly as more and more people use their mobile devices to browse the web.",
