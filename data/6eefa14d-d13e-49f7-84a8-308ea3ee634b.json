  "output": "One example of how artificial intelligence has improved healthcare is through the development of AI systems that can accurately identify diseases using image recognition. AI systems can also be used to analyze patient data which can provide insights into underlying diseases and help with decision making. Another example is the use of AI to automate the process of diagnosing diseases, which can reduce the amount of time and labor needed to diagnose a patient.",
