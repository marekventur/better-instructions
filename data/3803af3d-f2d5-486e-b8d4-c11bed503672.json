  "output": "I recently created a web application using the JavaScript programming language. The purpose of the application is to allow people to search for and purchase books online. The main features of the application are a search bar to find books and a checkout process to allow for the purchase of books. To deploy the application, I used an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance to host the application and an Amazon S3 bucket to store and serve the static assets of the application. In addition, I used an Amazon RDS database to store and serve the dynamic data necessary for the application.",
