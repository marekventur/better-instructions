  "instruction": "Create an algorithm to find the longest continuous increasing subarray in a given array.",
  "input": "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]",
  "output": "The algorithm should loop through the given array, comparing each value with its subsequent values. If the next value is larger than the current value, then the algorithm should add it to a subarray and compare the length of the subarray to the longest subarray found so far. If it is larger, then the longest subarray is updated and the loop continues. If the value is not larger, then the algorithm should reset the subarray and start from the current value and move forward again. When the loop ends, the longest subarray will be the longest continuously increasing subarray.",
