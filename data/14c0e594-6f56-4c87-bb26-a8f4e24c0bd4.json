  "instruction": "Describe how a divergent plate boundary forms",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A divergent plate boundary is created when two or more plates move apart from each other. At the convergent boundary, tensions in the Earth's lithosphere cause rocks to break, split, and move away from each other, creating a rift in the Earth's surface. As the lithosphere continues to spread, magma from mantle below rises to form new crust. On land, this process can create new mountain ranges. At the oceanic divergent plate boundary, new seafloor is created, which causes the ocean's depth to increase.",
