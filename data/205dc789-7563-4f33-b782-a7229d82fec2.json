  "input": "",
  "output": "In Linux, the permissions are divided into three levels - user, group, and others. The user level represents the user that owns the file, the group level represents the group that the user belongs to, and the others level represents all other users. Each level has permissions to read, write, and execute the file and these can be set separately to give each user the required access.",
