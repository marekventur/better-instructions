  "instruction": "What is the difference between a saturated and an unsaturated fat?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The difference between saturated and unsaturated fats is that saturated fats contain mostly single-bonded carbon atoms, while unsaturated fats contain one or more double-bonded carbon atoms. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature and are typically found in animal products such as beef and butter, while unsaturated fats are generally liquid at room temperature and are typically found in plant-based oils such as olive and canola.",
