  "input": "",
  "output": "Two strategies for preventing data loss are regular backups and using a redundant network infrastructure. Regular backups include making copies of data onto a secure medium such as a server, external hard drive, or the cloud, and can be scheduled automatically on a daily or weekly basis. Redundant network infrastructure is a system of network elements and nodes, such as routers and switches, that have multiple points of connection that can help minimize the interruption or failure of connections between data storage points.",
