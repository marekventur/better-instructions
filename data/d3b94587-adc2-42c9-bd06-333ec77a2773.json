  "input": "",
  "output": "Performance is the execution of a task or activity according to one\u2019s capabilities. Success is the successful completion of a task or activity, or the gaining of a goal. Performance and success go hand in hand as performance leads to success, but success does not necessarily imply good performance. Performance is measured based on how well a task is done or how quickly it is accomplished, while success is measured by the end result of the task.",
