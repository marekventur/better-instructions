He tightened his grip on the sword in his hand as he heard the distant roar of the dragon. It seemed like this would be the day that the dragon of terror would be brought to justice.\n\nThe knight braced himself as the creature flew into view, spewing fire and causing chaos. The knight drew his sword and charged into battle. He hacked and slashed at the dragon, determined to save his beloved kingdom. After a long and difficult fight, the dragon was slain. The kingdom cheered and the knight proudly returned to the castle, sword in hand and the dragon's scales draped over his shoulders.",
