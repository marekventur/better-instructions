  "instruction": "Describe the pros and cons of using an open source software.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The main benefit of using open source software is that it\u2019s generally free and can be customized by the user. In addition, many open source projects benefit from crowdsourced contributions which may lead to code improvements or the development of additional features. On the other hand, open source software is not always as reliable as proprietary software, as it may have fewer updates and lack the support of a dedicated team behind it. The code may also be less secure, as it is open to the public.",
