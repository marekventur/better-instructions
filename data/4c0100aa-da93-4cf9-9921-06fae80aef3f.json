  "input": "",
  "output": "Waves are oscillations that transfer energy in the form of vibrations. They do not transfer material, but the energy associated with them can be transferred from one place to another. Waves travel in a regular pattern and spread out in all directions. When a wave reaches its destination, it transfers the energy it carried when it was created, usually in the form of heat, light or sound. This energy can be used to move objects, create sound, and heat or cool objects.",
