  "output": "Computers can \"learn\" by using artificial intelligence algorithms that look for patterns in data. This data is then used to make predictions about future outcomes. By taking in new data, a computer can continually refine the predictions it makes and learn from the data. This process is what enables computers to tackle increasingly complex tasks.",
