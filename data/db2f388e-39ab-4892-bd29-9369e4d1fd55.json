  "input": "",
  "output": "The surface of Mars is mostly composed of rusty red dust and bedrock, with large areas of stone, sand, and dunes. There are many large impact craters, mountainous regions, and valleys, as well as many extinct volcanoes. The air on Mars is very thin, about 1% of the air on Earth. Temperatures can vary greatly and can get quite cold. The terrain of Mars is very rugged and much of it is covered in craters from meteorites and asteroids.",
