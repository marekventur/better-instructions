  "output": "Linear regression is a mathematical tool used in data analysis. It allows us to calculate the best-fitting line to describe a set of data points. This line is called the regression line. It is used when there is a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable. \n\nWe can use linear regression to model the relationship between two variables. We use a line of best fit to express how much one variable is affected by changes in another variable. We can also use linear regression to predict future values of the response variable given a known set of predictor variables.",
