  "output": "Google Sheets has built-in functions for comparing data in two cells. To do so, first select the two cells that need to be compared. Then click the \"Formulas\" option and select one of the comparison functions, such as \"IF\", \"GREATER THAN\" or \"LESS THAN\". Enter the two cell references in the function and then click \"Apply\" to compare the data. If the data in the cell meets the condition, then a \"TRUE\" value will be outputted and a \"FALSE\" value if it does not.",
