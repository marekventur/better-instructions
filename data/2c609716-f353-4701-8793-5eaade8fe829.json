  "output": "Developing a healthy sleep routine can be a great way to ensure a restful night's sleep. It is recommended to maintain a consistent sleep and wake schedule, even on the weekends. Establish a relaxing pre-bedtime ritual, such as reading a book, listening to calming music, or taking a warm bath. Make sure to keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet, and remove any electronic devices or screens. Try to avoid caffeine and large meals close to bedtime. Regular exercise can help to improve the quality of your sleep. Finally, plan for adequate sleep time: the National Sleep Foundation recommends 7 to 9 hours for adults.",
