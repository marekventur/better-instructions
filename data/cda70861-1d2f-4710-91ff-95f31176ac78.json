Political factors included the growing influence of Enlightenment ideals, a monarchy that failed to keep up with the changing times, and the formation of the Estates General. Economic factors included high levels of taxation and debt, subsistence agriculture, and unfair distribution of wealth. Military factors included the legacy of repeated wars and the absence of a standing army. Social factors included extreme poverty and social inequality.</p>\n    <h3>Stages of the Revolution</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>1789 - The French Revolution Begins:</strong> The Estates General meets, the Tennis Court Oath is taken, the National Assembly is formed, the Bastille is stormed, and the Great Fear sweeps across the country.</li>\n      <li><strong>1791 - Constitutional Monarchy:</strong> A Constitution is written, a new Legislative Assembly is formed, and a constitutional monarchy is established.</li>\n      <li><strong>1792 - The Reign of Terror:</strong> Louis XVI is executed, the Jacobins gain power, and a bloody period of repression and terror ensues.</li>\n      <li><strong>1799 - The End of the Revolution:</strong> Napoleon Bonaparte seizes power and declares himself emperor, ending the Revolution.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Impact of the Revolution</h3>\n    <p>The French Revolution changed the course of history by reshaping government and society, creating a new political and social order which influenced the rest of Europe. The Revolution had a lasting impact on politics and social life, as well as the economy. It made democratic ideas more widely accepted, challenged the power of the Church and aristocracy, and gave people a greater sense of individual rights. It also unleashed a wave of political and social change which spread quickly throughout Europe, leading to the formation of modern nation-states.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",
