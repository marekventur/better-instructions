  "input": "",
  "output": "A person should set good goals by making them SMART. SMART stands for: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time Bound. Specific goals should be clearly defined and easy to understand. Measurable goals should be easy to track and measure progress. Achievable goals should be attainable, neither too easy or too hard. Relevant goals should be meaningful and in line with larger goals or objectives. Time-Bound goals should have a target date or timeline by which they should be completed. Setting goals in this manner helps to ensure success in achieving them.",
