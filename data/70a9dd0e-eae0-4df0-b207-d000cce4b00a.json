The first step is a proposal of an amendment to the Constitution by two-thirds of both houses of Congress or by two-thirds of the state legislatures. The second step is ratification of the amendment by three-fourths of the state legislatures or conventions in three-fourths of the states. Once an amendment is proposed and ratified, it becomes part of the US Constitution and is legally binding for all US citizens.",
