  "output": "The major difference between cats and dogs is that cats are typically kept as indoor pets while dogs are usually used as working animals and spend more time outdoors. Additionally, cats are typically solitary animals and prefer to be on their own while dogs often live in packs and require interaction with other animals and humans. Furthermore, cats tend to be more independent and aloof than dogs, which are typically more dependent, loyal companions.",
