  "instruction": "Compare the experience of visiting two different historical monuments.",
  "input": "The Parthenon in Athens, Greece and The Colosseum in Rome, Italy",
  "output": "Visiting the Parthenon in Athens is an awe-inspiring experience. The Parthenon stands atop the Acropolis and overlooks the city below. It is a symbol of the Golden Age of Greece, and the art and architecture create a stunning view. On the other hand, visiting the Colosseum in Rome is a humbling experience. Although the Colosseum is imposing, its size also serves to remind visitors of the atrocities that occurred within its walls. Both monuments have their own unique beauty, but the experience each offers is drastically different.",
