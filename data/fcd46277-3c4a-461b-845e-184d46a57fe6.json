  "output": "Verse 1:\nTryin' hard, don't need no reason why / Gotta stay focused on the goals in life / Reach for the sky, don't stick with the ground / Keep your eye on the prize, hear the sound? / Smilin' faces in the crowd, so keep head up high / Lets go, tonight's the night to shine, oh why?\n\nChorus:\nReach for the sky, spread your wings, show 'em you can fly / Reach for the stars and take 'em by surprise / Reach for the sky, don't be afraid, reach for the sky / Reach for the sky, take the risk and reach for the sky\n\nVerse 2:\nEveryday starting from the ground / Take your time, look at the brighter side of life / Reach for the clouds, clear up the dark skies / Hopes up high don't listen to what the guys say / Follow your dreams, never give up on tryin' / Put your efforts, make sure you ain't slidin', no! \n\nChorus:\nReach for the sky, spread your wings, show 'em you can fly / Reach for the stars and take 'em by surprise / Reach for the sky, don't be afraid, reach for the sky / Reach for the sky, take the risk and reach for the sky\n\nVerse 3:\nGotta take the chance you got, make it count / You need some courage, need to shout out loud / Rally your friends, gather everybody and move / Step by step, and you know what you got to do / Don't fear the fate, don't fear the future too / Spread the love, and make a change for the better view\n\nChorus:\nReach for the sky, spread your wings, show 'em you can fly / Reach for the stars and take 'em by surprise / Reach for the sky, don't be afraid, reach for the sky / Reach for the sky, take the risk and reach for the sky\n\nOutro:\nReach the sky, never give up and take a risk / Reach for the sky and you'll be flying on your wish. Reach for the sky and make it happen, don't give up / Reach for the sky and you will never regret. (repeat 3x)",
