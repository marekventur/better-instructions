  "instruction": "List five differences between photosynthesis and aerobic respiration.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Photosynthesis occurs in plants and some bacteria, whereas aerobic respiration occurs in all living organisms.\n2. Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts and uses light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic molecules and oxygen, whereas aerobic respiration occurs in the mitochondria and breaks down organic molecules to release energy, producing carbon dioxide and water.\n3. Photosynthesis uses water as a reactant molecule and produces oxygen as a by-product, whereas aerobic respiration uses oxygen as a reactant and produces carbon dioxide as a by-product.\n4. Photosynthesis is generally an exothermic reaction, while aerobic respiration is an endothermic reaction.\n5. Photosynthesis uses electromagnetic radiation, such as sunlight, for energy, whereas aerobic respiration produces ATP molecules which provide energy for metabolic processes.",
