  "input": "",
  "output": "Preemptive scheduling algorithms are those that take priority into account when determining which process to choose next. These algorithms can take into account the priority of each process when they decide which process to assign to the CPU. Non-preemptive scheduling algorithms do not take priority into consideration. Instead, they assign the processes in the order in which they arrive.",
