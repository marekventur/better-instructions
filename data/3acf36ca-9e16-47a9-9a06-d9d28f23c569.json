  "output": "The 2005 version of \u2018Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\u2019 has several differences from the original version released in 1977. The 2005 version is notably darker and more serious in tone, and it features a number of special effects that were not available in 1977. Additionally, the characters of Anakin Skywalker, Padme Amidala, and Obi-Wan Kenobi are more fleshed out and given more depth in the 2005 version. However, the overall plot follows the same course in both versions.",
