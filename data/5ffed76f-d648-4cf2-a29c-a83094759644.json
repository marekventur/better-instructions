  "instruction": "What is an IP address?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An IP address is a numerical label assigned to a computer or device on a computer network. Each IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network, allowing data to be sent from one network device to another. IP addresses are typically written in a standard \"dotted decimal\" notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Each IP address is composed of four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1 consists of octets 192, 168, 1, and 1). IP addresses are used to route data from one network to another and can be public or private.",
