  "instruction": "Take the following terms and form an argument between them.",
  "input": "Free will vs determinism",
  "output": "The debate between free will and determinism has been a long-running one, with both sides presenting strong arguments. Those in favour of free will argue that we all have the power to make conscious choices to shape our own lives. Supporters of determinism believe that our lives are predestined and already determined by outside forces, such as biology or society. Each view presents compelling evidence, making it difficult to choose which one is correct. Ultimately, this debate comes down to whether the choices we make are truly our own or whether we are being predetermined by external forces.",
