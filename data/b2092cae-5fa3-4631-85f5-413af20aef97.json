  "output": "One effective way to track customer behavior and customer lifetime value for an online e-commerce store is to use analytics software such as Google Analytics. This allows the store to track customer behavior, such as which products customers view and how long they remain on the website. It also allows the store to track the customer\u2019s overall lifetime value, such as how much they have spent with the store and how much they are likely to continue spending. Additionally, the store can track customer loyalty and determine customer satisfaction with surveys, promotional emails, and more.",
