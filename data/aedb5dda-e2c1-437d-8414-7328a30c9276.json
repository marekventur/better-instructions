  "input": "",
  "output": "The Einstein\u2013Brillouin\u2013Keller (EBK) quantization condition is a quantum-mechanical rule that specifies the allowed energy levels or \u201cquantum states\u201d of a particle confined in a particular region of space. It states that when the particle has a total energy that is the sum of some multiple of the energy of the particle's motion in the region, it is allowed to exist in a distinct quantum state. The particle's motion is restricted to a certain area of space and its energy must be an integer number of times its angular momentum. This quantization condition is named after the three physicists who developed it: Albert Einstein, L\u00e9on Brillouin, and Jacobus Kapteyn.",
