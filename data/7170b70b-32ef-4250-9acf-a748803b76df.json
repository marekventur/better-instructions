  "output": "Two methods to reduce carbon emissions are carbon capture and storage (CSS) and renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. \nCSS involves capturing and storing carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes or power plants. This process is designed to reduce emissions from entering the atmosphere. CSS is often seen as an effective way to reduce emissions in the short term and is usually more cost effective than other alternatives.\n\nRenewable energy sources produce energy from natural resources that can be continuously replenished. These sources generally produce no carbon emissions and are often seen as a long-term solution for reducing emissions. Renewable energy sources can be more expensive upfront but may result in lower prices once the source is set up. In addition, renewable energy can be used more flexibly and offer an alternative to traditional power sources.",
