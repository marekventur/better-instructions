  "output": "Metabolism is the set of life-sustaining chemical processes that occur within a living organism. These biochemical processes allow organisms to grow, reproduce, and respond to their environment. Metabolism requires energy and can be divided into two categories: catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules into smaller components and releases energy, while anabolism combines molecules to form larger components and consumes energy.",
