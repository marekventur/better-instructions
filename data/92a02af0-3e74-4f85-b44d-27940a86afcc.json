When it comes to hiking, there is something special about both the summer and the winter. In this post, we\u2019ll be taking a look at the differences between hiking in the summer and the winter months. \n\nIn the summer, the weather is usually warm, making it the perfect time to explore the outdoors. The sun is out and the trails are covered in lush foliage, giving you an immersive experience as you hike. Hiking in the summer also means that you are more likely to spot some wildlife along the way. \n\nWinter hikes, on the other hand, come with a different set of experiences. The cold weather provides a unique challenge, as you bundle up in several layers of clothing to tackle the trails. You may find yourself trekking through some knee-deep snow, which adds a whole nother level of difficulty to the experience. But the scenery is arguably much better in the winter, as you get to appreciate the stunning snow-covered landscape. \n\nUltimately, the best season for hiking will depend on your own personal preference. We say, why not take the chance to experience both?",
