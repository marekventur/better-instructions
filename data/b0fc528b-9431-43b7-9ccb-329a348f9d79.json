Prepare yourself and practice: Prepare your answers to common questions, hone your communication skills and practice speaking out loud in front of a mirror or with a friend or family member. Use interactive tools like storytelling or roleplay to practice.\n3. Consider additional factors: Consider your body language, appearance, and style of communication. Prepare additional questions to ask the interviewer, arrive early, and bring copies of your resume and any other relevant documents.
