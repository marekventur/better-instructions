  "output": "When negotiating a job offer, it is important to approach the conversation with a plan. Before the negotiations begin, determine your ideal outcome and set your limits. Gather research on salaries and benefits that are typical for the job you are applying for in your geographic location. During the negotiations, avoid \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers, ask open-ended questions, remain calm and confident, show enthusiasm, be ready to compromise and don\u2019t be afraid to pause if needed. Finally, once the negotiation process is finished, be sure to thank the employer and confirm the deal verbally.",
