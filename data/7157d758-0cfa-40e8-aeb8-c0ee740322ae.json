  "output": "Bismuth is a chemical element with the symbol Bi and atomic number 83. It is a pentavalent post-transition metal and one of the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals. It has a disproportionate melting point and low electrical resistance, and is stable in air at room temperature.",
