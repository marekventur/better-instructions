  "input": "",
  "output": "This proverb means that it is always best to be honest and truthful. Honesty means being open and genuine, even if it would be easier or more beneficial to be deceptive. Being honest with others will lead to mutual respect and trust, while lying can lead to serious problems. Being honest can also lead to feeling better about oneself, as it is never enjoyable to have to keep track of one's own lies.",
