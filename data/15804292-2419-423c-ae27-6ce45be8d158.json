  "output": "As I look up to the night sky so high,\nI see a million stars that twinkle and shine;\nTheir beauty mesmerizes me, I won't lie,\nAnd I feel deeply in love with this divine.\n\nA blanket of stars in a dark, velvety sky,\nA ceaseless miracle, an eternity so high;\nA glimpse of beauty I may never understand why,\nBut I've been enamored since I caught its bright eyes.",
