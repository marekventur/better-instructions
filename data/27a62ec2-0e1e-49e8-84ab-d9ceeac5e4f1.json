  "input": "",
  "output": "Needs are things that are essential for survival, comfort, or well-being, while wants are optional things that a person desires but does not necessarily require for survival. Needs are usually free or inexpensive, such as food, clothing and shelter. Wants are often expensive and not essential, such as luxury items and entertainment. All people need and want different things, so it is important to differentiate between the two when making decisions.",
