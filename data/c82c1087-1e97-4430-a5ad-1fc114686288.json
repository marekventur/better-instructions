  "output": "Summer is for friends and fun. \nThe sun and the beach are the perfect pair.\nThe breeze blows in the smell of salt and sea.\nGrilling with family under the stars at night.\nMaking sandcastles by day, birds singing in the trees.\nLemonade and ice pops to keep us cool.\nCatching fireflies and telling stories before bed.\nWriting poems in the sand and watching them wash away.\nEnjoying the moments and creating memories to last.",
