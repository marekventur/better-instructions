  "input": "",
  "output": "The experiment should involve a sample of people who have never interacted with the bot before. The experiment should measure the accuracy of the bot's responses and the time it takes to make an appointment. The sample should include a range of different situations, including both simple and complex requests. The experiment should measure the effectiveness of the bot in both scenarios. Additionally, the participants' emotions should be measured to assess the satisfaction with the bot's interaction.",
