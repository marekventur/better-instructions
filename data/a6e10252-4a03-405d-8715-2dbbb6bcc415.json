  "output": "In fifty years, the world will likely be much different than it is today. Advances in technology will have an immense impact on the way we live our lives, including the way we work, communicate, and learn. We can expect more efficient, environment-friendly methods of transportation, and perhaps even colonization of other planets. Automation and AI are likely to make life easier, with more time being devoted to leisure and lifestyle pursuits. Health will be improved due to advanced medical technology, and global awareness of sustainability, climate change, and other environmental issues is likely to have led to significant progress in protecting our planet.",
