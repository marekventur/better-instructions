  "input": "",
  "output": "The Earth's temperature fluctuates due to changes in the amount of energy from the Sun that is received, released or reflected by the atmosphere and surface of the Earth. Changes in clouds, aerosols, oceans, and land also affect temperature. Additionally, increases in certain gasses, such as carbon dioxide, traps heat within the atmosphere and causes further warming.",
