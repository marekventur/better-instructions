  "input": "",
  "output": "The five fundamental principles of Stratified sampling are probability sampling, proportionality, homogeneity, independence, and integrity. \n\nProbability sampling means that all individuals from the population have an opportunity of being selected, which is usually done with random sampling. Proportionality means that the sample should match the proportion of the population it represents. Homogeneity ensures that the strata have similar characteristics within themselves. Independence ensures that the individual members of the sample are independent of each other. Integrity makes sure that the sampling procedure is not tampered with.",
