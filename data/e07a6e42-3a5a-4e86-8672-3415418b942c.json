  "output": "In order to provide better healthcare in India, we need to focus on making healthcare more accessible and affordable. This can be accomplished through investing in public healthcare infrastructure and providing subsidies and incentives to private healthcare providers. We also need to invest in improving and increasing access to medical knowledge, ensuring that health practitioners are qualified, developing rural health centers, and spreading awareness about preventive healthcare. Additionally, the government should also focus on healthcare legislation to ensure that the healthcare provided is of the highest quality.",
