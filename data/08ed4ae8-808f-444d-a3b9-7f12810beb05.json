  "output": "The user interface should have a clean, intuitive design that can be easily accessed and used by all users. To achieve this, it should have visual consistency and use elements such as menus, buttons, and search bars. Additionally, the display should allow users to quickly scan over content and find what they are looking for. The interface should also be customizable and support adaptive design so that it can be used across multiple devices and platforms.",
