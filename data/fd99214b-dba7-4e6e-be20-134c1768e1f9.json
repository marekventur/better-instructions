  "instruction": "Describe the physical appearance of a character, including their clothing and accessories.",
  "input": "Gerald, a rebellious teenager",
  "output": "Gerald was a rebellious teenager with a wild streak. His clothes were always a bit too baggy and his accessories that bit too bold. He wore a black t-shirt with blue jeans and had a leather jacket that was ripped in several places. On his wrist, he had a metal cuff bracelet and a pair of vintage shades that matched his carefree personality. He also had a few piercings in his ears and one eyebrow, but the most noticeable was his spiked hair which seemed to stand out against the backdrop of conformity.",
