  "instruction": "Describe in detail a customer service experience that fulfills the customer needs",
  "input": "No input",
  "output": "A customer service experience should start with a friendly and welcoming attitude. The customer service representative should take the time to thoroughly listen to the customer's needs and answer any questions they may have. The representative should also make sure to go the extra mile to ensure that the customer's experience is of the highest quality possible. The customer should be able to walk away feeling that their needs have been met and their satisfaction is guaranteed. Ideally, the experience should leave the customer feeling like they have been listened to and that their input was valued.",
