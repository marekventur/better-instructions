  "input": "",
  "output": "This statement is subjective, and depends on a person's own opinion and perspective. There are some aspects of the world that are better now than 10 years ago, such as the advancement of technology and the increasing awareness about global climate change and sustainability. However, there are also aspects which are worse, such as the widening economic inequality and increasing social unrest in many countries. It is impossible to definitively say that the world as a whole is better or worse than it was 10 years ago.",
