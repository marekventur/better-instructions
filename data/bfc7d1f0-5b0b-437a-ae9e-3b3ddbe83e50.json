  "output": "The moral of the folktale \"The Tortoise and the Hare\" is that slow and steady wins the race. The hare, who boasted of its speed and boasting of its victory before the race began, was easily outmatched by the tortoise who perseveresad onward despite its lack of speed. The turtle went the distance and succeeded in crossing the finish line first, proving that it is not always the fastest who wins the race, but rather the one who is willing to put in the hard work.",
