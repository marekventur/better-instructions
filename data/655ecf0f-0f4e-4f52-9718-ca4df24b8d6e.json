  "input": "",
  "output": "The Moon rotates because it is tidally locked to the Earth, meaning one side of the Moon is always facing towards the Earth. This is due to the gravitational pull of the Earth on the Moon, which has slowed down its rotation over time. Since the time it takes the Moon to rotate is equal to the time it takes for the Moon to orbit the Earth, it has become tidally locked. This means that the same side of the Moon is always facing the Earth while the opposite side remains in darkness.",
