  "instruction": "Why are numbers written in the base 10 system instead of a smaller base system?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The base 10 system, also known as the decimal system, is used because it is the most natural and efficient choice for humans when counting and representing numbers. Humans have 10 fingers, so it is very convenient to use a system of counting and representing numbers that requires 10 digits (0-9). Furthermore, the base 10 system allows us to write larger numbers more concisely than any other system. For example, it would take six digits to write the number 100 in the binary system, but in the base 10 system, it is only three digits. Additionally, the base 10 system allows for fractions and decimal values, which is not possible in any other base system.",
