  "input": "",
  "output": "A machine learning model can be used to recognize handwriting by taking images of a person\u2019s written words and then transforming them into numerical data. This data is then fed into an algorithm that is trained to recognize patterns in the data and classify them as different characters. Once the model is trained, it can be used to accurately identify written words when given an image of handwriting.",
