  "output": "Shallow learning is a type of machine learning which uses easier to train algorithms to learn simpler patterns in data. It requires less data and computing power compared to deep learning, and focuses on learning pre-defined or known patterns in data. Such algorithms are used to address problems that do not need to adapt quickly to data. \n\nDeep learning, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning that uses multiple layers of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learn more complex patterns in data. It typically performs better than shallow learning algorithms, as it can learn from more data and learn more generalizable patterns. Deep learning also can infer useful information from unlabeled data, and can handle complex tasks like image and speech recognition.",
