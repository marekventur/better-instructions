In this passage, Jesus speaks of a servant who was entrusted with his master's money and then given the responsibility of investing it. The servant did not complete his task, but instead chose to bury the master's money instead. Jesus emphasizes that the master was greatly displeased with this servant's lack of faith, and reminds us that we must remain faithful and devoted to our Master in heaven if we want to find eternal salvation.",
