  "output": "Constructive feedback is a type of communication designed to provide specific and actionable guidance to help someone reach a desired outcome. It is used to help the receiver grow and develop in their role. It should not be punishing but instead should focus on the process or behavior and be delivered in an atmosphere of warmth and respect. Constructive feedback should be timely, specific, and honest, and should provide balanced information on what's going well and what needs improvement.",
