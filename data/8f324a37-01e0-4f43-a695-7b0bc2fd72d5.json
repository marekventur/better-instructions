  "input": "",
  "output": "The ageing population across many countries presents a major challenge for the health-care system. With more elderly people at risk of chronic diseases and increased demand for those in home and long-term care, health-care services need to be more innovative and efficient in order to meet the needs of the ageing population. This includes better prevention strategies for the elderly, more telemedicine and digital health to expand access to care, and greater use of robotics and other technologies to help reduce labour costs. In addition, governments and policy makers must consider increased funding to provide adequate resources and services to meet the needs of an ageing population.",
