  "input": "",
  "output": "Machine learning enables the automation of certain tasks that are too complex or too tedious for humans to do. It enables machines to learn from data and make decisions on their own without human intervention. Machine learning algorithms are at the core of automation tasks such as natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and predictive analytics.",
