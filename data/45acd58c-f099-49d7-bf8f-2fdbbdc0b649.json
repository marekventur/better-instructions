  "output": "I can create a program to detect plagiarism in text. First, the program would take a given text and create a list of words with their frequencies. Then, it would compare this list to the lists of similar texts in a local database to identify any matches. If a text has similarities with another text, then the program could identify it as potentially plagiarized. The program could also add a score based on how much of the text has been copied from other sources. This score could let users know how much of a text is plagiarized.",
