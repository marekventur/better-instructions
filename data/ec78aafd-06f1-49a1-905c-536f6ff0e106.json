  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between natural and artificial selection is that natural selection occurs in nature while artificial selection is performed by humans. Natural selection is based on survival of the fittest, while in artificial selection, humans choose to breed plants or animals with specific traits in order to create a desired outcome. Natural selection is driven by the environment, while in artificial selection, humans are the selectors.",
