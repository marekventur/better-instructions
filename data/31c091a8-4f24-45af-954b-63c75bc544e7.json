  "output": "Once upon a time there was a creature known as the Shapeshifter, who roamed the lands of Oerth. The creature had the unique ability to change its form at will, from a tiny mouse to a mighty lion, from a fierce dragon to a beautiful dove. Its abilities allowed it to slip through unnoticed in nearly any corner of Oerth, but it feared being seen in its true form. \n\nOne day, the Shapeshifter encountered a wise wizard. Seeing the fear in its eyes, the wizard offered it safety and protection in exchange for a pact - that the Shapeshifter must obey any three requests the wizard would make of it. The Shapeshifter accepted the offer without hesitation, and the pair set forth across Oerth. \n\nThe wizard asked the shapeshifter to help him in his quest to protect the realm from the rising forces of darkness. Through the Shapeshifter's magical abilities, they were able to foil the plans of powerful mages, outwit the traps of magical creatures, and eventually vanquish the evil forces. The grateful people of Oerth thanked them both for their brave deeds.\n\nThough the wizard had promised him freedom, the Shapeshifter chose to stay with the wizard for the rest of its days, for the wizard was its only real friend.",
