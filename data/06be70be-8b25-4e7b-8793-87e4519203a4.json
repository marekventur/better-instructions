  "input": "",
  "output": "Energy flows through a food chain by starting with a producer, such as a plant, that utilizes the energy from sunlight to produce food in the form of carbohydrates and oxygen through photosynthesis. This energy is passed through a series of consumers, each of which eats a lower trophic level, until it reaches the apex predator at the top of the food chain. The energy is released from the food chain when the apex predator dies and is decomposed by decomposers.",
