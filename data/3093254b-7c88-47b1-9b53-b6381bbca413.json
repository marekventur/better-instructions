  "input": "",
  "output": "A method of converting solar energy into electricity is called photovoltaics. This process involves using solar cells to convert the sun's energy into direct current electricity. Solar cells are typically made of layers of semi-conducting materials like silicone. When sunlight strikes the cells, electrons in the material are excited and result in the streaming of direct current electricity that can then be used for a variety of purposes.",
