  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP functions with a range of algorithms and is built on the foundation of deep learning. The primary steps in an NLP workflow consist of language understanding, language generation, and dialog management. Language understanding analyzes the structure of text to identify concepts, entities, or topics, among other features. Language generation is the process of taking information from the understanding step and transforming it into natural language. Finally, dialog management incorporates context from preceding conversations to enable back-and-forth dialogue between the user and the system.",
