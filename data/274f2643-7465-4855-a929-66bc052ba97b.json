  "input": "",
  "output": "Digital wallets offer users more convenience than paper wallets because users can access their wallet from anywhere with an internet connection and can easily store, send, and receive digital assets. Additionally, digital wallets are secure and allow for fast transactions, meaning users can receive their funds quickly without waiting for the payment to be processed. Finally, digital wallets also provide users with the ability to keep track of their transactions and complete them without being physically present.",
