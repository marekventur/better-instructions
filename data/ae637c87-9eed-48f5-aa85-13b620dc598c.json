  "input": "",
  "output": "A great creative project for a group of 6 marketers would be to create an original logo for a product launch or promotional event. Each team member should choose a different aspect of the project that speaks to their strengths. For example, one person could design the logo, another could develop a color palette, and so on. The team should also have regular touchpoints to review and discuss each other's concepts and ideas. After the initial design phase, they should then move on to producing the logo in several different sizes and designs, as well as making final tweaks based on feedback from the group. Finally, the group could develop a strategy to ensure that the logo is seen by their target audiences in the most effective way. \nAll in all, creating an original logo together would be a great project for a group of 6 marketers to flex their creative muscles. With organization and teamwork, the final logo produced will be something the team can be proud of!",
