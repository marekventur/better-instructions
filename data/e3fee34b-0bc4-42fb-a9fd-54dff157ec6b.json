  "output": "A computer and a smartphone share many similarities, as they are both electronic devices that run on a variety of operating systems, are capable of connecting to the internet, and can be used to perform a variety of tasks. However, there are also key differences between the two. Computers are more powerful and capable of performing more advanced tasks and functioning as a desktop or laptop. Smartphones are more portable and are specifically designed to fit in your pocket and be used on the go.
