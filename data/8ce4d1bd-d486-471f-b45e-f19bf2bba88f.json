  "input": "",
  "output": "The main benefit of artificial intelligence (AI) is increased efficiency and accuracy in completing tasks. AI can automate mundane tasks, freeing up humans for more creative endeavors, and can often be more accurate and less prone to human error. On the other hand, AI has its drawbacks, such as the potential for bias in the algorithms used to create it, and the possibility of displacing humans from certain types of jobs. Additionally, certain types of artificial intelligence can be seen as intrusive, either because of its influence over decision-making processes or because of the sheer amount of data it collects.",
