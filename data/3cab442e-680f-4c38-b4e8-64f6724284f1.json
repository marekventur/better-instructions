  "input": "",
  "output": "The proliferation of technology has changed the way we interact with one another, and it has led to an increased demand for greater digital rights. Technology has created an enormous amount of data, which has been monetized by companies that can legally gain access to it through regulations and contracts. This has raised many concerns about privacy, security and freedom of expression. From the misuse of personal data to hostile control over online discourse, individuals\u2019 digital rights are being abused and exploited. \n\nWe need more effective laws and policies that protect digital rights, such as the right to access your own data, to engage in public discourse without interference, and to be able to communicate freely and securely in the digital arena. This will require an understanding of the ways in which technology is increasingly being used to undermine our rights and freedom, as well as greater transparency and accountability from those who protect our data. The impact of the digital age is far-reaching and it has become increasingly important to ensure that individuals\u2019 digital rights are respected and upheld in our increasingly digitized world.",
