  "instruction": "Extrapolate a plausible fantasy creature from the following description.",
  "input": "A creature with a humanoid body but the wings of a hawk",
  "output": "The creature had a humanoid body but its skin shimmered, reflecting the light of the moon like a shimmering mantle. Its movements were lithe and quick, its dark wings unfurling from its back in mere moments. It had the head, torso, and limbs of a human, but its wings were those of a hawk. It moved with the grace and agility of a soaring predator, its eyes ever darting and searching. Most strange of all were the glowing symbols on its forehead, symbols of a forgotten time and place, a mystery never to be revealed.",
