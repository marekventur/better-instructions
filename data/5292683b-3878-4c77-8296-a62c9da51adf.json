  "instruction": "Explain why the following statement is true: \u201cZero multiplied by any number is equal to zero.\u201d",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The statement \"Zero multiplied by any number is equal to zero\" is true because multiplying a number by zero always results in zero. This is because any number multiplied by zero is the same as multiplying that number by a fraction which is equal to zero. Additionally, multiplying zero by any number will always equate to zero, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative. Therefore, zero multiplied by any number will always result in zero.",
