  "input": "Opinion: Sharks should have more protection",
  "output": "1. Sharks are integral to the ocean's ecosystems and without them, the ocean's food chain could collapse, leading to a disruption of the balance of the oceanic ecosystem. \n2. Sharks are also a major source of tourism revenue as people flock to places with thriving shark populations to observe and interact with these fascinating creatures. \n3. Sharks often suffer from human-induced mortality and habitat degradation, both of which can reduce their populations, which in turn can lead to species extinction. Therefore, more protection is needed to ensure their survival.",
