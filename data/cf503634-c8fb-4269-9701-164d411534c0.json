  "input": "",
  "output": "The most important point to include in an essay about the global financial crisis is that the root of the crisis lies in a complex interplay of economic, social, and political forces, and that solutions must take into account the global nature of the crisis. It is also important to include the role of central banks and governments, as well as global economic integration, in the analysis. Finally, a thorough understanding of the financial tools used to try to mitigate the effects of the crisis should be explored, such as quantitative easing and guarantees on assets.",
