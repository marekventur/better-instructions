  "output": "Getting enough sleep is essential for good health and wellbeing. Poor sleep is linked to a range of health conditions including increased risk of depression, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It can also impair cognitive functioning, leading to decreased attention span and memory, decreased decision-making skills, and increased risk of accidents. In addition, sleep deprivation can affect hormones that regulate hunger, leading to weight gain. It is therefore essential to prioritize getting enough sleep to ensure both physical and mental wellbeing.",
