  "input": "",
  "output": "The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used for creating and deploying software applications. Different SDLC models have varying levels of complexity, due to the nature of their individual components. For example, a Waterfall model is more rigid and sequential, while an Agile model moves at a faster pace with more flexibility. Other SDLC models, such as the Spiral model and DevOps, have different levels of complexity depending on the project requirements and organization's needs.",
