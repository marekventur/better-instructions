  "input": "",
  "output": "Utilitarianism is a moral philosophy that holds that the best moral action is the one that produces the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people. This requires weighing the value of a certain action against its consequences, in order to determine if the good it produces outweighs the costs. Kantianism is a moral philosophy that holds that people should act in accordance with universal moral laws, which hold regardless of the consequences. This requires people to take into account the motives behind their actions, not just the consequences. The ultimate aim of utilitarianism is to bring about the greatest good, while the ultimate aim of Kantianism is to adhere to universal moral law.",
