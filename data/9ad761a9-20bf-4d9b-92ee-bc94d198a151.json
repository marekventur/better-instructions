  "input": "",
  "output": "A firewall is an important security measure for a network as it prevents unauthorized access to the data. It acts as a gatekeeper that blocks malicious traffic while allowing legitimate traffic to pass. Firewalls can control both incoming and outgoing traffic and selectively allow or block connections depending on the rules set by the user. By doing so, it can help protect the network from attack and prevent the spread of malicious software such as viruses, worms and Trojans. It is an important tool for network security and can help reduce the risk of data loss and theft.",
