I took a few deep breaths and reminded myself that I had a lot to offer and that this was an opportunity to make new connections. So, I put myself out there, started talking to people, and soon I found myself talking to interesting people and having meaningful conversations. I soon felt at ease and felt glad that I had decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and attend the event.",
