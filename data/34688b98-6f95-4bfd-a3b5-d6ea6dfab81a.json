  "output": "Three techniques used to improve the accuracy of a natural language processing model are data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter optimization. Data preprocessing involves cleaning and formatting data for the model; feature engineering involves creating new features from existing data; and hyperparameter optimization involves finding the optimum parameters for the model to improve its accuracy.",
