  "input": "",
  "output": "GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a language modeling algorithm based on Transformer architecture that has achieved immense success in many NLP tasks such as question-answering and text summarization. GPT models learn the likelihood distribution of a language by using a large amounts of data, pre-trained models, and transformer networks. GPT models are faster to train and provide strong baseline performance without requiring much additional training data as compared to other language models. GPT models offer high accuracy in many applications which makes them highly applicable and valuable to many businesses and individuals. Furthermore, since GPT models are able to learn and generate language, they can be used to generate high-quality natural text.",
