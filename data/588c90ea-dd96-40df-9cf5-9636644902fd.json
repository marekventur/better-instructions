  "output": "I recently read the book The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It's an intriguing story that follows the life of Jay Gatsby and the splendor and decadence of the Roaring Twenties. The themes of love, ambition, and illusion are especially relevant in the novel, and it's a classic that will always stay with me.",
