  "input": "",
  "output": "One concern about the impact of technology not related to privacy invasion is the effect of technology on mental health. Technology can lead to overstimulation, distraction, and disconnection with the physical world, leading to mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Additionally, excessive technology use can make it difficult to socialize in person, leading to decreased communication and physical interaction with peers. Another concern is the potential threat of technology replacing or displacing jobs. Many traditional, labor-intensive occupations are being replaced by automated machines and software, resulting in global unemployment. Finally, while the advancement of technology is often lauded as a way to combat climate change, if not regulated, unchecked technology growth can have significant environmental implications, such as increased pollution and energy consumption.",
