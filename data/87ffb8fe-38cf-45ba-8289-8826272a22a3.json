  "output": "Two techniques to improve your memory are spaced repetitions and mnemonic devices. Spaced repetitions involve revisiting material or ideas periodically and increasing the intervals between repetitions to help store the information in long-term memory. Mnemonic devices are techniques used to aid recall, such as creating vivid mental images of words or concepts, quoting information in your own words, and forming associations between new knowledge and existing knowledge.",
