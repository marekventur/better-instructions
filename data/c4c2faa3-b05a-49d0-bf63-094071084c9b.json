  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a cook named Jack who lived in an old village near a forest. He heard rumors of a lost treasure deep in the forest that had been hidden many years ago by an old prince. One day, Jack was approached by an old man who asked if he could help him find the lost treasure. Jack agreed and the old man told him of a secret door deep in the forest that would lead to the hidden treasure. \n\nSo Jack and the old man set off into the forest, with only the old man's map to guide them. After hours of trekking through the wilderness, they finally came across a small door hidden in the dense vegetation. They opened the door and inside was a small chamber with a large chest. Inside the chest was a vast fortune of gold coins, jewels and artifacts, the lost treasure of the prince! Jack and the old man were overjoyed with their discovery, and the old man thanked Jack for his help before leaving with his treasure. Jack then returned to his village with the tales of treasure, ready to help anyone else who might be looking for it.\n\nTHE END.",
