  "input": "",
  "output": "A GPT-2 model is a type of language model that uses a transformer-based architecture to generate human-like text. It works by using an encoder to map an input string to vectors, and a decoder to generate an output sequence one word at a time. The model uses the encoder-decoder architecture to process an input string by taking into account the context of the words in the string, and then generating an output sequence based on the learned information.",
