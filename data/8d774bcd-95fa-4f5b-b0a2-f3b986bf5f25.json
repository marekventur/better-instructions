  "input": "",
  "output": "A predictive analytics model works by using past data to make predictions about future events. It starts with collecting a large set of historic data, which will then be used to identify patterns and build a predictive model. This model is used to make predictions about future data. The predictive model is usually based on machine learning algorithms such as regression and classification, which are used to train the model to recognize patterns from the training data. Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions about future events by considering the past data and its patterns.",
