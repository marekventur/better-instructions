  "input": "",
  "output": "The words \u2018employ\u2019 and \u2018hire\u2019 share some similarities but have distinct differences. Both words refer to the process of bringing someone in to work, either as an employee or as a contractor. However, the term \u2018employ\u2019 generally implies a longer commitment than \u2018hire\u2019, as employers are typically responsible for providing benefits and workplace protections like minimum wage and overtime. Hiring, on the other hand, is often less formal and often occurs on a shorter-term basis. The term \u2018hire\u2019 is also sometimes used to refer to the wages paid to an employee or contractor.",
