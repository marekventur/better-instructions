She had been hoping and wanting a traditional gift from him, something from his hometown that she had never seen before. When she opened the present, she was delighted to find a hand-crafted fan with intricate designs she had never seen before. She was overjoyed and thanked her relative for his thoughtful gift, eager to learn more about where it was from. The girl treasured her gift, using it to cool herself on hot, summer days, and as a reminder of her special connection to her distant relative.",
