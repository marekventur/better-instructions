  "input": "",
  "output": "To make an omelette, I would start by cracking two eggs into a bowl and whisking them until they have a light, uniform colour. Then I would heat some butter or oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Once the fat is hot, I would pour the eggs into the skillet and let them cook for a minute. Then I would use a spatula to push the edges of the omelette toward the centre and let the raw egg move to the sides. At this point I would add in any desired fillings, like cheese, vegetables, or herbs, and then carefully fold the omelette in half. Once the omelette is golden brown, I would remove it from the heat and serve it.",
