  "input": "",
  "output": "I once worked closely with a colleague who was difficult to deal with. Despite having all of the necessary skills for the job, this person consistently failed to meet deadlines, disregarded the team's decisions, and spoke to everyone with a dismissive attitude. I needed to find a way to get the necessary work done without creating a hostile environment, so I started by implementing an official tracking system to document progress and hold everyone accountable. I also spoke candidly with the person, explaining the importance of staying on track and respected the team's decisions. Over time, this person began to understand our expectations better and improved their work behavior significantly.",
