  "output": "Poverty can have wide-reaching and profound effects on mental health. Low income, limited access to resources, and lack of stability can lead to increased stress and depression. People living in poverty are more likely to experience trauma and adverse childhood experiences, which can lead to an increased risk of developing mental health problems, including anxiety and depression. Further, poverty can limit access to quality mental health care, making it difficult to get the help that is needed to manage mental health issues.",
