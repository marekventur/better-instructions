  "input": "",
  "output": "Yes, taxes should be lowered for everyone. Raising taxes on all citizens has been proven to be an ineffective way to increase revenue, while publishing additional taxes and stagnating wages can put a strain on our citizens\u2019 finances. Moreover, our current economic situation has left many families struggling to make ends meet, and reducing taxes could provide some much needed relief to those who are struggling the most. \n\nIn addition, lower taxes will incentivize businesses to invest more and create jobs, leading to economic growth that will benefit everyone. Low taxes will also incentivize businesses to take risks and pursue innovation, meaning that everyone stands to benefit from greater innovation and investment. Furthermore, lowering taxes for everyone can create a greater sense of fairness and equality, since everybody is being taxed the same way. \n\nOverall, reducing taxes for all citizens is an effective way to stimulate economic growth, create jobs and foster innovation, while helping those who are struggling the most, and is an efficient way to make sure that everyone is being taxed fairly.",
