  "input": "",
  "output": "This is a generic trading card game that uses decks of 60 cards where players take turns drawing cards from a shared deck, playing cards from their hand, and using special abilities. The goal of the game is to reduce the other players' points to 0 by using card abilities, trading cards, and strategic decision-making. Each card contains a value, a type (attack, defense, special ability, etc.), and an ability description. Players can use combinations of cards to create an effective strategy and win the game.",
