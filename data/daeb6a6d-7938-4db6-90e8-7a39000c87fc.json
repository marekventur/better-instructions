  "input": "",
  "output": "Extrusion is the process of forcing metal through a die to produce shapes with a fixed cross-sectional profile. It involves the use of a metal extrusion press, where metal is heated to a high temperature, and then forced through a die which shapes the metal into the desired shape. Depending on the application, different press tools and speeds may be used.",
