  "output": "Reptiles and amphibians are both classified as vertebrates, however there are a few key differences between them. Reptiles are known for having dry, scaly skin and are ectotherms, meaning they rely on external sources, such as the sun, to regulate their body temperature. Amphibians, on the other hand, have moist, smooth skin, and unlike reptiles, they are amphibious, meaning they can survive both out of water and in it. Reptiles also typically have longer life cycles than amphibians and reproduce by laying eggs. Amphibians, on the other hand, lay eggs in water and many metamorphose into their adult form.",
