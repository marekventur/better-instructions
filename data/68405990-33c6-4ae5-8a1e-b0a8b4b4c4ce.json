  "input": "",
  "output": "The similarities between an atom and a solar system are that they both have a nucleus, or a central core, which is composed of protons and neutrons and is surrounded by electrons. Both also have a hierarchy, where the nucleus is held together by strong nuclear forces and the electrons are held in orbit by weaker electromagnetic forces.",
