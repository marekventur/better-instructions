  "output": "Data cleaning and preparation is an essential step in the data analysis process because it allows for accurate and reliable results to be achieved from the analysis. Data can often be noisy or contain incorrect or missing values, therefore it is necessary to clean and prepare the data by identifying and removing inaccurate, incomplete, or redundant information.
