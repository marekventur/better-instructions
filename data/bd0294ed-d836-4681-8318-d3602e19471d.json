  "input": "",
  "output": "Environmental factors such as temperature, light, water, and soil quality can have a significant impact on the growth and development of plants. Temperature affects a plant's physiology, as too much heat or cold will affect the plant's metabolism and growth rate. Light determines the amount of photosynthesis a plant can perform, with too little or too much light hindering photosynthesis and therefore limiting growth. Water is essential to the transport of nutrients and other materials in the plant, and too much or too little can cause wilting or other maladies. Poor soil quality can prevent a plant from taking up the nutrients it needs for optimal growth.",
