  "input": "",
  "output": "A potential challenge for the GPT model when trying to complete instruction #2 might be that it does not have enough contextual information about the job and relevant skills for the role being applied for. The GPT model may be able to write and format a good cover letter, but it may not have access to the candidate's background and qualifications or the job details that are required to tailor the cover letter to the job. Additionally, it may lack the emotional intelligence or creativity required to craft a cover letter that stands out from the competition.",
