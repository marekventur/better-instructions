  "instruction": "What is conditional probability?",
  "input": "No input required",
  "output": "Conditional probability is the probability of a particular event happening, given that another event has already taken place. It is written as P(A|B), which reads as \"the probability of event A given event B\". For example, if you roll a dice, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6, or P(6) = 1/6. However, if you know the dice has already rolled a 5, then the conditional probability of it rolling a 6 is 0, or P(6|5) = 0.",
