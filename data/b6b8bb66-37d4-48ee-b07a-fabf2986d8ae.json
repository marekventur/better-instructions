  "output": "The ozone layer is a layer of the Earth's atmosphere that protects us from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. It is located about 10 to 30 miles above the Earth's surface, and it absorbs almost all of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Without the ozone layer, life on Earth would be impossible.",
