  "input": "",
  "output": "Zero defect programming is a software development methodology which puts emphasis on preventing errors and bugs rather than fixing them after they occur. The goal is to produce a high-quality product by carefully writing the code, testing at every stage of the process, and performing thorough code reviews. By implementing this methodology, developers can reduce the amount of effort spent on debugging, save overall development time, and ensure higher quality standards.",
