  "input": "",
  "output": "The goldfish slowly blinked his eyes, adjusting to the sudden brightness of his new surroundings. Looking around cautiously, he could see the unfamiliar faces of people leaning in close and peering at him, their intense gaze making him feel quite uncomfortable. His fins began to quiver as he was slowly moved between two sets of hands that completely surrounded him. He was now completely out of his fish tank, and so he swam in circles and watched nervously as different objects and strange lights moved around him. He could no longer hear the water he was accustomed to, and the air felt hot and dry. He had never felt so exposed and vulnerable before, and he was unsure of what to expect next.",
