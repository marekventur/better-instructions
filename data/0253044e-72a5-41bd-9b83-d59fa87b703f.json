  "output": "A habit that can help people stay productive is to set aside time each day for focused work. Taking breaks throughout the day to step away from the task at hand and reset can also help maximize productivity. Additionally, it can be beneficial to break down larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks. This can help make the project seem less daunting and make it easier to keep track of progress.",
