  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a sparrow who had a dream of living in a lighthouse. He had heard of the beautiful lighthouse at the edge of town, but he had never seen it. One day, he decided to take the journey to find it. As he flew towards the edge of town, he noticed a beautiful vase in the window of a nearby house. He flew closer and closer to the vase, intrigued by the way the sun glinted off its surface. As he flew ever closer, he suddenly realized he had found the lighthouse! He perched atop it, enjoying the view of the sea below. From that day forward, the sparrow called the lighthouse his home.",
