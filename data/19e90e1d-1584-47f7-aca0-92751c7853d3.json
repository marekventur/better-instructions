  "output": "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. This is because the act of measuring one value changes the other, meaning that there is always a level of uncertainty in the results of measurements made. This principle is one of the foundations of quantum mechanics.",
