  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) deals with understanding and manipulating language, including text and speech. NLP techniques are used for tasks such as document classification, text summarization, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Computer Vision, on the other hand, is the process of understanding and interpreting visual data such as images or videos. Techniques used in computer vision include object recognition, scene analysis, and motion estimation. NLP and computer vision are two different fields of research. NLP is focused on understanding language while computer vision is focused on understanding visual data.",
