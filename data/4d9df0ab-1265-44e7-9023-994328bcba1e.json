  "output": "The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer that wraps around the outside of the cell. It serves as a barrier that helps to regulate the movement of substances in and out of the cell, and it also provides structural support. Additionally, the protein receptors embedded in the cell membrane are responsible for identifying signals from outside the cell and initiating cell responses.",
