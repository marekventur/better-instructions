  "instruction": "Name two types of air pollution and describe how each affects human health.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "There are two main types of air pollution: particulate matter and gases. Particulate matter are small particles that can enter the human respiratory system and cause long-term health problems such as respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Meanwhile, gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide can cause short-term health problems such as headaches, nausea, and dizziness. Both types of air pollution can lead to an increased risk of premature death due to their negative effects on the heart and lungs.",
