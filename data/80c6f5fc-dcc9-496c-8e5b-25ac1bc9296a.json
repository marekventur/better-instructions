  "output": "1. Look the other person in the eye while they are speaking. \n2. Don't talk too much. Give the other person a chance to talk and express their thoughts.\n3. Focus on understanding the other person's point of view instead of focusing on what you are going to say in response.\n4. Don't disregard the feelings of the other person. Show respect for their thoughts and feelings even if you don't agree with them. \n5. Take notes and ask questions where appropriate. This will help you remember what was said and demonstrate to the other person that you are genuinely interested in what they are saying.",
