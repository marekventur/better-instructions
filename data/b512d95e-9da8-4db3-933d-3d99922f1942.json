  "input": "",
  "output": "Python is often considered the best programming language for developing machine learning applications due to its intuitive syntax, comprehensive library of tools and packages, and easy integration with other languages and frameworks. Python is a preferred language for deep learning tasks, as it has powerful data processing capabilities, efficient numerical computing, and excellent graphical capabilities. For faster computations, Python can be combined with other languages such as C++ or Java for faster performance. In addition, Python's machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras and Scikit-Learn make it an ideal language for building powerful ML models.",
