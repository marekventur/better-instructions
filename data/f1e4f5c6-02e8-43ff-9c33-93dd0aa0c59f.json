  "output": "Electrical conductivity is a measure of a material's ability to conduct an electric current. It is commonly measured as the reciprocal of electrical resistivity. The SI unit of electrical conductivity is siemens per meter (S/m). Generally, materials that are good electrical conductors are metals, whereas materials with low electrical conductivity are insulators.",
