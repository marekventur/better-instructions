  "output": "The logo for Coffee Beans LLC could include a logo design that features a circle with a coffee bean inside and two stalks of coffee beans outside the edges of the circle. The background color of the logo could be a light brown to signify the color of coffee beans, with the text \"Coffee Beans LLC\" written in bold, black lettering. To give the logo a modern visual appeal, the edges of the circle could be lined with a gold pattern and the text could feature a gradient color transition from brown to gold.",
