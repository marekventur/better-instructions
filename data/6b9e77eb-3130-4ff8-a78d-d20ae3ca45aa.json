  "input": "",
  "output": "The quote by Edmund Burke emphasizes that inaction towards injustice can be just as damaging as active participation, and is just as complicit. This is especially relevant in the current political climate, where there are many cases of injustice, as this quote is a reminder of the importance of taking action against these wrongdoings. Furthermore, it encourages citizens to take a stand and voice their opinions, as well as to take action in the fight against injustice. Through doing so, we can ensure that good prevails over evil.",
