  "input": "",
  "output": "An experiment to test the effect of temperature on plant growth can be conducted by growing several plants in a controlled environment and exposing them to different temperatures. The growth of the plants should be tracked by measuring the height and number of leaves every day. The control group can be kept at a set temperature, while the experiment group can be exposed to higher and lower temperatures. The results can then be analyzed for comparison.",
