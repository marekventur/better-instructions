  "input": "",
  "output": "Cats are amazing pets for many reasons. For one, cats are more independent than dogs and require less attention. They also tend to be more low-maintenance since they don't need to be taken out for walks or need as much open space and exercise. In addition, cats are great at keeping away pests and since they spend most of their time indoors, they're great for people living in apartments or small homes that don't have access to a large outdoor space. Finally, cats are more quiet and relaxed than dogs, making them ideal for people who want a pet but need peace and quiet in their home.",
