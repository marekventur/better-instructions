  "input": "",
  "output": "Resource leveling is a technique used in project management for managing resources in order to maximize efficiency and ensure deadlines are met. It involves the redistribution of resources such as personnel, money, and materials so that each task is given the same amount of resources, regardless of the actual demands it may need. This ensures that resources are assigned efficiently, eliminating unnecessary expenditure.",
