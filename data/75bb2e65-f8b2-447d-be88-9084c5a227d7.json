  "instruction": "Evaluate the safety of a five-foot-long ladder.",
  "input": "5-foot-long ladder",
  "output": "This five-foot-long ladder appears to be safe for light-duty use, such as reaching items that are stored high up, provided that it is sturdy and in good condition. However, it wouldn't be suitable to use when painting a house or as part of a job that requires more support or heavy materials. One should always use the appropriate ladder for the task and check for any signs of wear and tear before using it.",
