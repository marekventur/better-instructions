  "output": "One way to inspire more people to become coding experts is to create a culture of coding. This can be done by teaching coding to all students, regardless of their age or background. This can be through public schools, coding bootcamps, or other educational programs. It is also important to create an environment of support and collaboration where people feel safe to ask questions or get help. Additionally, companies can engage with the coding community in meaningful ways and actively promote coding events and meetups. By connecting with excellent teachers and mentors, people can learn coding with guidance, support, and inspiration.",
