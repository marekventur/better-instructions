  "output": "The sky is ablaze with a vibrant hue, \nColors painting the night like a dream come true. \nThe horizon is glowing as the sun takes its leave, \nAnd the last rays of light dance upon the sea. \n\nMountains, trees, and sand blend together, \nThe warm evening breeze fills the air with contentment. \nStars emerge in the sky; twinkling like diamonds in the night, \nAccompanied by the chirping of crickets, everything seems alright. \n\nThe moon rises to take the place of day, \nEverything is standing in stillness, a blissful array. \nA sight so beautiful, so pure and bright, \nAll worries drift away in the magical sight.",
