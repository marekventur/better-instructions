  "input": "",
  "output": "The El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle is a recurring climate pattern characterized by unusually warm temperatures in the central and eastern regions of the tropical Pacific Ocean. It impacts global climate patterns, weather patterns, and oceanic circulation patterns. During periods when ENSO is active, rainfall increases in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, while rainfall decreases in other regions due to warmer temperatures, leading to drought and other climate-related events. ENSO can also cause extreme weather conditions, including hurricanes, floods, and heavy snowfall in certain areas.",
