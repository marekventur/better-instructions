  "input": "",
  "output": "One algorithm to find the most efficient path between two points is the Dijkstra's algorithm. It works by finding the shortest path from one node (starting point) to every other node in the graph. The algorithm continually updates the shortest path between the two points, as it visits each node along the way, until it reaches the destination.",
