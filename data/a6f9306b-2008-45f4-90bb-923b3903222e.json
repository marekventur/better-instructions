The homepage should have prominent links to all the important functions as well as a search bar for quick navigation. The layout should be clean and uncluttered, with plenty of white space to make it easier to read, and buttons should be intuitively placed. Fonts and colors should match the overall theme, and the interface should be responsive to different screen sizes.",
