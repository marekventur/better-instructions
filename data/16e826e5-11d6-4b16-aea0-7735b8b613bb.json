  "input": "",
  "output": "The law of supply and demand states that prices of goods and services are driven by the interaction between the availability of a product and the amount of demand for it. When prices increase, it signals to producers to create more of the product, as there is a higher demand, and when prices decrease, it signals to consumers to buy more of the product as it has become more affordable. This process helps to balance the supply and demand of goods and services, keeping prices relatively stable and helping ensure an efficient allocation of resources.",
