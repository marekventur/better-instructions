  "input": "",
  "output": "There is no definitive answer, as it can depend on a variety of factors, such as the maturity of the child, the policies of the social media platform and their parent's comfort level. However, most social media platforms recommend that children should be at least 13 years old before they create an account. Additionally, parents should also consider monitoring their child's activities on social media and teaching them to be aware of the risks associated with using social media, especially at a young age.",
