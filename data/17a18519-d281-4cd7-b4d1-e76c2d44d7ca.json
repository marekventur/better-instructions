  "input": "After all, we're only human",
  "output": "This line suggests that humanity is imperfect and has limitations. That despite our best effort or intentions, mistakes or failures are inevitable. That we can only expect so much of ourselves. It also implies that we have to take a compassionate view of ourselves and our mistakes, understanding that we are only human and cannot always expect perfection.",
