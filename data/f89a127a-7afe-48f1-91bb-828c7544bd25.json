  "input": "",
  "output": "Trees are important in our environment because they provide essential life-sustaining services that directly and indirectly affect our health, livelihood and quality of life. They provide us with oxygen, clean and filter water, moderate climate and provide habitat for wildlife. They are also a source of food, medicine, materials and energy. They also act as a buffer against wind and water erosion and regulate temperatures. Trees help provide shade and mitigate the urban heat island effect. They can also prevent flooding and landslides.",
