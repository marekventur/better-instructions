  "output": "The sun shone brightly in the sky. Its rays shone down on the small town below, its people bustling about their daily lives. The trees were blossoming, flowers in full bloom and the birds chirped in the clear sky. It was a peaceful morning in the town, and the people were happy and content. Suddenly, something strange happened. An old man appeared on the street, walking slowly and purposefully towards the town square. The townsfolk stopped and watched curiously as the man marched past. No one knew where he was going or why he was there, but the people soon found out. He arrived at the town square and announced to all that he had an amazing gift to offer \u2013 the gift of eternal life! Everyone gasped in amazement and curiosity. He told them that he would only share the gift with those who could solve his riddles. The townsfolk scrambled to prove their worth, and the old man gave them the most difficult and challenging riddles they had ever faced. Those who could solve the riddles were given the gift of eternal life, and the others were left behind. The town was forever changed, and the old man mysteriously disappeared, never to be seen again.",
