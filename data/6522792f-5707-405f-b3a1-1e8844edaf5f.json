  "input": "",
  "output": "A Markov Chain is a type of mathematical model in which the next state of a system is only dependent on the current state. In the most basic terms, it is a system which predicts the future behavior of a process based on the current state of the system. In this way, the behavior of the system is determined solely by the probabilities of different possible states.",
