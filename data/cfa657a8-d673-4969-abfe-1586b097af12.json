  "input": "",
  "output": "Cryptography could be applied to ensure data security when data needs to be sent over the internet, for example when a file containing confidential information needs to be shared between two parties. In this situation, encryption protocols can be used to scramble the data so that only the original sender and receiver of the data can read it. This ensures that even if data is intercepted in transit, it will remain secure and inaccessible for anyone else.",
