  "output": "The Beguine Movement was a popular, itinerant, lay religious movement that began in the region of what is now Belgium in the 12th and 13th centuries, founded by beguines, members of a lay religious order. Though it had its roots in the Catholic Church, the Beguine Movement spread throughout much of Europe, influencing theological thought in the area and inspiring other spiritual orders, such as the Franciscans and Dominicans. Beguines sought to balance religious piety with social action and rejected material goods and hierarchical organization, while still following religious and scriptural guidance. The Beguine Movement reached its peak in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries and gradually faded away with the spread of the Protestant Reformation.",
