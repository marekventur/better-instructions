  "input": "",
  "output": "AI can be immensely helpful for crime detection as it can help law enforcement agencies in making decisions, gathering evidence, identifying suspects, and helpful witness interviews. AI can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on investigations, and also make it easier to process data quickly and accurately. AI can also assist with the analysis of surveillance footage and generate alerts in cases of suspicious behaviour. As AI continues to improve, its use in law enforcement can help to reduce the occurrence of crime and efficiently detect and apprehend criminals.",
