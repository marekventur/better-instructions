  "instruction": "Imagine there is a button that when pressed, it would make all the poverty in the world go away. Should the button be pressed?",
  "input": "No input",
  "output": "It is difficult to say whether the button should be pressed without considering all of the potential consequences. On the one hand, removing all poverty in the world would no doubt have a positive effect on everybody, both economically and emotionally. On the other hand, the world economy is complex and difficult to predict, and even an event as seemingly positive as removing poverty could lead to unintended consequences that might outweigh the original benefit. Therefore, it's important to consider all of the potential effects before making such a decision.",
