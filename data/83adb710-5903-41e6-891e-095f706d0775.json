  "input": "",
  "output": "The process of digesting food in the body begins in the mouth, where the food is chewed and mixed with saliva to form a bolus. The bolus then travels down the esophagus to the stomach, where enzymes and stomach acids start to break down the food into smaller molecules. From there, it travels to the small intestine, where nutrients and other substances are absorbed into the bloodstream. The remaining waste is then transferred to the large intestine where water is removed and the material is compacted into feces. The feces is then expelled from the body through the rectum.",
