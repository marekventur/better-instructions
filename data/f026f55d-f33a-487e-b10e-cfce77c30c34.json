  "output": "The customer portal should be designed with the customer in mind and should provide an easy, intuitive experience. The navigation should be concise and simple, and customers should be able to quickly find the information they're looking for. The visuals should be modern and engaging and the language should be clear and concise. Each page of the portal should have a clear purpose and should have a professional, polished design. The customer portal should also have a search bar, which can be used to quickly and easily retrieve any necessary information. Additionally, the customer portal should provide a feedback section, so customers can easily let the company know if they have any questions, comments, or suggestions.",
