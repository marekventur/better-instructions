  "output": "We propose a three-tier customer data management plan for our company. First, we will ensure that customer data is collected and stored securely. This includes using a secure database, encryption techniques, and secure user authentication.\n\nSecond, we will create a system for regularly auditing customer data usage and access. This will help us detect and prevent any unauthorized access to customer data.\n\nThird, we will create an anonymous data collection process to ensure customer privacy. Any data collected will be anonymized to protect customer privacy and protected with strict access control measures.\n\nWith this plan, we will be able to safeguard customer data and guarantee the highest levels of security and privacy.",
