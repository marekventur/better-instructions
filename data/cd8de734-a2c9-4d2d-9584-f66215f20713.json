  "output": "Natural Language Generation (NLG) is the task of automatically producing natural language text or speech as output from a machine. Examples of NLG systems include systems that generate summary texts from a database, generate dialogues with a user, generate reports from data sets, or write text from images. NLG systems typically involve large statistical models trained on massive datasets that use natural language processing techniques to parse, analyze and construct sentences in a given language.",
