  "output": "The main types of natural disasters are floods, landslides, hurricanes and tornadoes, wildfires, earthquakes and tsunamis, and drought. Floods occur due to heavy rain that causes rivers to overflow and cause damage to land and buildings. Landslides happen when soil and rocks slide down a slope. Hurricanes and tornadoes are strong storms with strong winds and heavy rain. Wildfires are caused by dry weather, strong winds, and human activities. Earthquakes and tsunamis are due to seismic activity under the sea. Drought is a lack of water due to dry weather.",
