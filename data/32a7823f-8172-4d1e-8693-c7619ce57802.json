  "output": "The Hindenburg Disaster happened on May 6th, 1937 when the German airship, known as a zeppelin, named the Hindenburg was attempting to dock at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. Unfortunately, a spark from the landing area caused the hydrogen within the Hindenburg to ignite. In a matter of seconds, the massive zeppelin was engulfed in flames and fell to the ground. All but 37 of the 97 people on board were killed and news of the disaster spread quickly, becoming one of the most remembered events of the 1930s. The tragedy was both a public and financial blow to the future of airships, and to this day, still serves as a reminder of the human cost of technological catastrophes.",
