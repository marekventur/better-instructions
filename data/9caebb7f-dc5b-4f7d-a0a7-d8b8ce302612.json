  "output": "The process of baking a cake involves several steps. First, you need to gather the necessary ingredients, such as flour, sugar, butter, eggs, and any desired flavorings or additions. Next, you should preheat the oven to the desired temperature and prepare the cake pan.\n\nOnce the ingredients are gathered and the oven is preheated, you can begin mixing the cake batter. Start by creaming the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, then add the eggs one at a time, beating the mixture after each addition. Once all the eggs are added, add the dry ingredients in thirds, alternating with any additional liquids. Mix until the mixture is light and evenly combined.\n\nOnce the cake batter is complete, pour it into the prepared cake pan and place it in the preheated oven. Bake the cake, checking periodically and testing it with a toothpick to make sure it is cooked through. When the cake is done, take it out of the oven and allow it to cool before removing it from the pan and serving.",
