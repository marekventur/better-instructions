  "output": "Basketball and soccer are two completely different sports. Basketball is played on a hardwood court indoors or outdoors, while soccer is played on a grass or turf field. Basketball involves dribbling and shooting a ball into a hoop and is scored by the number of basket made in the game. Soccer, on the other hand, involves kicking a ball into a goal and is scored by the number of goals scored in the game. Basketball is typically a contact sport, while soccer is a non-contact sport. Basketball games are very fast paced with quick scoring opportunities, while soccer games tend to be slower and have more deliberate attacks.",
