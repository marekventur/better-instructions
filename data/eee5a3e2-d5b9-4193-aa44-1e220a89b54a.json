  "instruction": "You are making a game. Design how a player will move around the environment.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A player should be able to move around the game's environment by using the keyboard or mouse. Movement should be intuitive, and the player should be able to move in any direction, including up, down, left, and right. Additionally, for more realistic movement, the player should be able to move diagonally in any direction and be able to jump or run. To help orient the player, the environment should provide visual clues in the form of landmarks or other navigational aides.",
