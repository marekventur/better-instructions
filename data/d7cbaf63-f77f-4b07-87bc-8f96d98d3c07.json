  "input": "",
  "output": "Racial discrimination is still a pervasive force in today's society due to systemic racism, implicit biases, and entrenched structural and cultural forces. Racial discrimination remains prevalent because of the historical legacy of racism, which has perpetuated inequality, inequity, and disparities in access to education, employment, housing, and more.
