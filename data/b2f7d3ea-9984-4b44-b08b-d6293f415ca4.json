  "output": "Making a mountain flower bouquet is a fun and easy project. Start by gathering a variety of mountain flowers including lupines, columbines, fireweeds, and harebells. Remove and discard any dead leaves or stems from the flowers. Arrange the flowers in a circular bouquet piercing them with a straight pin or with a wire. Use a small piece of twine or floral tape to securely wrap around the stems, then trim the twine or floral tape. Finally, display and admire your beautiful mountain flower bouquet!",
