  "output": "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which algorithms learn to map input data to known outputs. It requires labeled data which are the result of the application of certain rules or processes which have previously been determined by a human expert. This data is used to train the algorithm to learn patterns which can then be used to produce predictions given new, unseen data.",
