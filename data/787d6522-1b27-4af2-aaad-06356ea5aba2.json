  "output": "The political history between the USA and Cuba starts in the late 19th century when the US began to intervene in Cuban politics and gain control of the country's economy. In 1959, Fidel Castro overthrew the US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista, provoking a breakdown in relations between the two countries. In response, the US imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, which lasted until 2015 when US President Barack Obama announced plans to begin normalizing diplomatic ties.",
