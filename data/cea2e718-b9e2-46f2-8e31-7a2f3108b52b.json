  "input": "",
  "output": "The mountain range stretches across the landscape, its jagged peaks formed from millions of years of erosion. The rocky faces are covered in snow, reflecting the early morning sun as it rises over the horizon. The craggy mountains are interspersed with lush valleys, verdant with wildflowers and pine trees. The peaks rise from the rolling hills, cascading down into an ancient sea of fog. The range is a powerful reminder of the strength and beauty of nature.",
