  "input": "A beach on a sunny day",
  "output": "The sun is beating down on the beach, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The smell of salty sea air is carried to the shore by the gentle ocean breeze. The sound of waves crashing against the shore is a soothing and calming backdrop to the view of the white sand and sparkling blue water. The warmth of the sun on your skin creates a pleasant, relaxed feeling.",
