  "input": "",
  "output": "One argument for why online education should be encouraged is that it is more accessible to those who may not have the opportunity to attend in-person classes. It can also be a more economical option, as students save money on travel expenses, room and board fees, and other related costs. Additionally, the flexibility of online education means that it is tailored to the individual needs and learning styles of the student. As a result, the student is able to dedicate their time and energy to completing their studies in their own way. Finally, with the advancement of technology, online education can be a more interactive experience, with students gaining access to virtual whiteboards, remote breakout groups, and other online services that can enhance the educational process.",
