  "output": "One strategy I use to improve my creativity and problem-solving skills is brainstorming. Brainstorming helps to generate lots of ideas in a short amount of time and allows space for creativity. It helps to break complex problems down into smaller ones, which can then be tackled one at a time. Additionally, it encourages collaboration between different members and creates a space for exploration and experimentation.",
