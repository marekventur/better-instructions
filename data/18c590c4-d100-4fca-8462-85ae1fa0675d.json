  "input": "",
  "output": "The ratio of the surface area of a circle with radius 4 cm to a square with side 4 cm is approximately 2.5 to 1. The surface area of the circle is 0.50265 x pi x 16 squared = 50.265 cm\u00b2, while the surface area of the square is 4 cm x 4 cm = 16 cm\u00b2. That means that the ratio of circle surface area to square surface area is 50.265:16, which is approximately 2.5 to 1.",
