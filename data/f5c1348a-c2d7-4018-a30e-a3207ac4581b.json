  "output": "World War II began in 1939 when German leader Adolf Hitler invaded and occupied Poland. This was the catalyst for a series of events that led to a global conflict. Other major causes of World War II include the rise of fascism in Europe, the Japanese occupation of parts of Asia, and the inability of the League of Nations to stop aggressive actions by the Axis powers. Economic, military and ideological forces also fueled the conflict.",
