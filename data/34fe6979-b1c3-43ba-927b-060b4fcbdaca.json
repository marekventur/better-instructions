  "input": "",
  "output": "Businesses may choose to outsource customer service functions to take advantages of cost savings, access to specialized skills, and refocus internal resources. Outsourcing customer service can be an effective way to reduce costs by taking advantage of labor market differences, allowing an organization to access cheaper labor than if they were to staff the operations internally. Additionally, access to specialized and experienced customer service representatives can improve customer experience, which ultimately leads to better customer relations and an increase in sales.",
