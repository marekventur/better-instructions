  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a planet in the corner of the universe known for its flying aliens. They travelled all around their home planet, surveying its lush landscape, and then ventured out to explore the moons and stars of neighbouring galaxies. \n\nEvery day, the aliens flew through different places to observe and appreciate the natural wonders all around them. They had prodigiously large wings that allowed them to effortlessly travel faster than the speed of light. Whenever they grew tired, they landed in a nearby meadow and fed on the dew-filled flowers of the night.\n\nThe creatures had an incredible connection with the universe that left many amazed. They also had an innate bond with nature and every living species. Everyone revered these creatures, not only for their unfathomable beauty, but also for their grand sense of kindness and respect for all living creatures. \n\nThese benevolent flying aliens peacefully roamed their world, and whenever they passed by, they left an enchanting spark in the hearts of those they touched. \n\nThe End.",
