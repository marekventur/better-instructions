  "instruction": "Compare and contrast a relational database and a non-relational database.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A relational database stores data in tables that are related or linked to each other. This structure enables the data to be easily accessed and updated. A non-relational database on the other hand stores data in a more flexible, unstructured way. This flexibility allows the data to be more easily scaled and adapted to changing needs. Relational databases offer better data reliability and security, while non-relational databases offer better scalability and flexibility.",
