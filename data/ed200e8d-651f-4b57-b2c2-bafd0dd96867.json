  "output": "The website should have a homepage displaying the bookstore\u2019s selection including bestsellers, recently released and upcoming books, a curated selection of book collections, and customer reviews. There should be a search bar to easily find books by author, title, or genre. Each book's individual page should list its details including description and review rating, as well as a \u201cbuy now\u201d button that brings the customer to a payment option. The website should also have a blog with news related to books, authors, and the bookstore itself, as well as a customer service page and contact information.",
