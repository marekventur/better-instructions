  "output": "The beauty of the world both great and small,\nA hint of optimism we can recall.\nIn nature there is magic, undiscovered places,\nBeauty unique enough to fill our faces.\n\nThe world\u2019s treasures varied so wide,\nEach held with beauty far and wide.\nWhether the mountaintops or the gentle streams,\nThe beauty is too grand to ever miss it seems.\n\nThe life that dwells below and high,\nLiving and growing in constant why.\nThe perfect balance and harmony,\nAll brilliant in ways so extraordinary.\n\nAs we behold this beauty in all its grace,\nWe can think of nothing but to praise in its place.\nThe beauty and sight of such magnificence,\nA triumph greater than our eternal precedence.",
