  "input": "Beowulf",
  "output": "Three important themes of Beowulf are heroism, fate, and revenge. Heroism is reflected throughout the poem through Beowulf\u2019s fights with monsters such as Grendel and Grendel\u2019s mother. Beowulf\u2019s strength and courage show him to be a true hero, as well as his willingness to lay down his life for his people. Fate is another important theme of Beowulf as demonstrated through Beowulf\u2019s death. Despite his superhuman strength, Beowulf is unable to defeat a dragon and is slain by it. Unfortunately, by the time Beowulf realizes he can no longer fight, he is too old and too weary to defeat the dragon. Revenge is another important theme of the poem. After Grendel murders a number of Geats and Danes, Beowulf declares his intentions to avenge their deaths and returns to slay Grendel. Even though Grendel\u2019s mother is successful in killing Beowulf, he is able to take revenge on her before his death.",
