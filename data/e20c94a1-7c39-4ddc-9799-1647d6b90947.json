  "instruction": "What would you do if your best player is consistently reaching their peak physical performance but lacking in mental strength?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "I would prioritize working on their mental strength first, as mental strength is the foundation for physical performance. This would involve engaging in activities that increase the athlete's mental toughness such as working on positive self-talk, goal setting, relaxation techniques, visualization and imagery, and other strategies. Additionally, I would make sure the athlete is taking time for rest and recovery to help them stay focused and energized.",
