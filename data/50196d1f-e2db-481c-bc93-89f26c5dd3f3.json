  "output": "The potential risks of deploying a cloud computing solution include data security risks, potential compliance issues, weak access control, and an increased attack surface. Data security risks may arise from inadequate protection mechanisms, lack of control over how data is stored or used and data may be vulnerable to loss or corruption. Potential compliance issues may arise due to lack of data security and inability to meet industry specific regulations. Weak access control may lead to unauthorised access to sensitive data and systems. Finally, an increased attack surface may increase the company\u2019s risk of cyberattacks.",
