  "output": "The energy cycle of the sun is the process by which energy is produced, transferred, and ultimately converted back into energy. In the core of the sun, nuclear fusion reactions take place, converting hydrogen atoms into helium. This releases energy in the form of gamma radiation and other forms of radiant energy, which escape the sun\u2019s core in the form of light and heat. This energy travels through space and eventually reaches the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where it is either absorbed, reflected or scattered before reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. On the surface, this energy is converted into a number of forms (e.g. heat, light, kinetic energy), which are eventually converted back into energy and sent back out into space.",
