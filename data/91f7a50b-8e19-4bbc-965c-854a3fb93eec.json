  "input": "10, 65, 8, 22, 15",
  "output": "The median of the given numbers is 15. The median is the middle point of a dataset where the values are sorted in ascending or descending order. It is the number at the halfway point, where half the numbers are above it and half the numbers are below it. It is an ideal measure of central tendency as it is not affected by extreme values. The median gives us an idea of the typical value in the dataset.",
