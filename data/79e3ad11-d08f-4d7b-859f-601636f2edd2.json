  "output": "When I was younger, one of my most memorable summer experiences was visiting my grandparents in the countryside. I spent my days running around in the sprawling fields and beautiful forests, exploring the meadows and finding wild animals kind enough to let me observe them. We also went on long hikes, stopping to pick wildflowers and berries. In the evenings, my grandparents would tell me stories underneath a starry sky, sending me off to sleep feeling inspired and full of wonder.",
