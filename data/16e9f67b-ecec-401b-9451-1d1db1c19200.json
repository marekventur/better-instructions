  "input": "",
  "output": "It had been a long mission, and the spacecraft was nearly empty when they landed. As each of the crew departed, they looked around the ship and were sure they had everything they had taken with them. But when they got to the entrance to the ship, they noticed that something was left behind. \n\nCuriously, they approached the item and realized it was a small wooden box. Inside they found a odd-looking mechanical creature with two motionless eyes. Being a curious bunch, they opened the box to see what it was. It was an old-fashioned automaton sent by a loved one from back home. When they wound it up, its eyes lit up and it slowly moved its body to the sound of a faint, distant music.\n\nThe spacecraft was empty when the crew had left, but something special and unexpected had been left behind.",
