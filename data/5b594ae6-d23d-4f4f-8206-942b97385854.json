  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that studies and develops algorithms to allow machines to learn from data and perform human-like tasks. AI enables machines to reason, learn, and understand what it is asked to do. Regular Expressions (RegEx), on the other hand, are strings of text to match and manipulate text data. RegEx is used to define complex patterns in a text string, allowing for a quick and efficient comparison of text against given parameters. Unlike AI, RegEx is not used to understand language or generate decisions, but to quickly and accurately scan data.",
