  "instruction": "Summarize the difference between a tab and a space.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The difference between a tab and a space is that a tab is a single character and creates a fixed-width spacing, while a space is a single character that can create variable-width spacing. When used in programming, tabs can help define a scope and create an improved visual structure of the code than spaces. However, spaces are more commonly used because the variable-width spacing enables better readability. When used to format text, tabs insert a true tab character whereas spaces insert a space character.",
