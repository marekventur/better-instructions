  "output": "Here are two ways to reduce stress in a high-pressure workplace: \n1. Make time for yourself. It is important to take a break from work-related tasks and look after your own mental health. Take breaks throughout the day, go for a walk, or find an activity that helps you relax. \n2. Communicate openly and effectively. Establish clear expectations with coworkers and superiors, take responsibility for mistakes, and be open to feedback to ensure that tension doesn\u2019t build up in the workplace. Open communication will help ensure that everyone\u2019s needs are being met.",
