  "output": "Jenna arrived back at home feeling disoriented and confused. After a long day of school, all she wanted was to curl up in her bed, but an eerie feeling stopped her. Jenna's bedroom had been painted with strange symbols, and she couldn't make out any of them. She slowly backed away, certain that something wasn't right.\nSuddenly, she heard a strange laugh that sent a chill down her spine. Jenna whipped around, only to find an old woman standing in the corner of her room. The woman had the most intense eyes and an evil smirk. \"You must be Jenna,\" she cackled. \"It's time for your training to begin.\" \nJenna trembled in fear - who was this woman and what did she want from her? The woman opened her mouth to explain but was abruptly interrupted by bright lights that began to swirl around the room. \"Follow the lights,\" she commanded, and Jenna obeyed.\nThe lights took her to a room she had never seen before. It was a long hallway with several doors, and each door had a placard with a mysterious name on it. Jenna studied one of the doors and read the name \"Alice\". Just as she was about to open it, the old woman appeared again. \"This is your destiny, Jenna,\" she said. \"Go in and find out who you really are.\" \nAnd so Jenna stepped into the portal, with no idea of what lay ahead. She had no idea what to expect, but she knew that her life was about to change forever.",
