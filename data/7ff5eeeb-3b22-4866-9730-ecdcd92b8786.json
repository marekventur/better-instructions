  "instruction": "Create a website design that matches the given style.",
  "input": "Clean and minimalistic, using pastel colors",
  "output": "The website design should employ clean and minimalistic elements, with a soft pastel color palette throughout. The font should be either sans-serif or modern subtle and the background should be a light color. The images used should be bright and striking, but not too cluttered. There should be plenty of white space to keep the design visually pleasing and easy to navigate. The menu should be clear, intuitive and concise, and the content should be divided into clear sections with relevant headlines.",
