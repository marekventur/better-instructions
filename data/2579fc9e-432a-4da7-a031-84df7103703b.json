  "input": "",
  "output": "The cover of a book about mythology could feature an image of an ancient temple surrounded by stars, a sketch of different gods and goddesses, or a dramatic tableau of a mythical creature. A cover should evoke the grandeur of mythology, while also giving the reader a clear idea of the book's contents. Colors could include deep reds, blues, and purples, combined with gold and silver accents to capture the mythical nature of the book.",
