  "input": "",
  "output": "A game plan to reduce waste should start by measuring and understanding the amount of waste being generated in the first place. It should then focus on prevention and education - reducing the amount of waste that is required in the first place and increasing awareness of the resources and materials we use. This could be done through recycled materials, energy efficiency, and cutting back on the amount of plastic used. Additionally, it should identify processes that generate the most waste and target those for improvement. Finally, implementation of policies and measures to track, reuse, and properly dispose of waste should be developed in order to further reduce our environmental impact.",
