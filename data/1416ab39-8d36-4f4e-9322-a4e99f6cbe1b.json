  "input": "",
  "output": "Machine Learning and Deep Learning are both forms of Artificial Intelligence, but they have different uses and applications. Machine Learning focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions, while Deep Learning involves creating complex neural networks that are able to process large amounts of data and make more accurate predictions. Deep Learning has gained more popularity recently due to its increased accuracy and its ability to process large datasets.",
