  "output": "The training protocol for new employees should involve scheduling a series of onboarding meetings with key personnel to go over the company's products, services, policies, and procedures. It should also include a thorough introduction of the company's culture, its mission and values, and expectations of the employee. The new employees should also be provided with adequate time to practice and receive feedback on their progress. Finally, the protocol should involve regular check-ins with the employee to assess their growth and any challenges they may be facing.",
