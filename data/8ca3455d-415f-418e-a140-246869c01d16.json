  "input": "",
  "output": "The widely popular fable or myth, \"The Tortoise and the Hare,\" has roots in ancient Indian and Greek stories. The story was popularized by Aesop, the Ancient Greek storyteller who is credited with composing approximately 600 fables. In his telling, a hare who thinks himself unbeatable insults a much slower tortoise, claiming that the tortoise could never catch up with him. The tortoise accepts the challenge, and despite its much slower speed, it eventually overtakes the arrogantly confident hare, who had stopped off to take a break. The moral of the story is that slow and steady has greater strength than arrogance and haste.",
