Cream together the butter and powdered sugar in a mixer. Gradually add in the all-purpose flour and mix until the dough is smooth. Press the dough onto the bottom of an ungreased 9x13-inch baking pan. Bake for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, mix together the eggs, sugar, 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Pour the mixture over the baked crust. Bake the lemon bars for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Allow the bars to cool before cutting into them. Enjoy!",
