  "input": "",
  "output": "A centrifugal force is an inertial force that appears to act on all objects when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. It is directed away from the axis of rotation and is proportional to the mass of the object and to the square of its angular velocity. It is an outward, radial force that can be used to describe the motion of objects in a circle.",
