  "input": "",
  "output": "The difference between a direct object and an indirect object is that a direct object is the recipient of the action of a verb, while an indirect object is the recipient of the direct object. For example, in the sentence \"She brought him a gift,\" \"him\" is the direct object and \"a gift\" is the indirect object. The direct object is the person or thing to which the action of the verb is directly applied, while the indirect object is the person or thing to whom the direct object is given.",
