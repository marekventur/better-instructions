  "input": "",
  "output": "My passion for collecting stamps started when I was 8 years old. My father had given me my first stamp collection and I soon became obsessed with the variety of colors, designs and stories that each stamp contained. I started to research the histories and stories of each stamp in order to find out more information and uncover secrets behind them. I slowly expanded my collection, always on the hunt for unique and hard to find stamps. I felt proud when I was able to find one that I was missing from my collection from a far away place. With each new stamp I collected, I felt a sense of accomplishment and joy. Collecting stamps has been a hobby that I will never tire of discovering and learning more about.",
