  "input": "",
  "output": "A lazy algorithm improvement pattern can be used to detect and improve performance. The basic idea is to wait until the algorithm begins to show signs of slowing down, at which point optimization techniques can be applied to it. This pattern allows for minimal overhead in the best case while still catching and fixing poor performance in the worst case.",
