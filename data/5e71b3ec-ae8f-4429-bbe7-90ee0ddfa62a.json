  "input": "",
  "output": "Water is essential for human life because it facilitates the basic metabolic processes that occur in the human body. Our bodies are composed primarily of water and without it, we would be unable to survive. Water participates in numerous essential metabolic processes, such as digestion, absorption of nutrients, regulation of body temperature, waste excretion, circulatory transport, and lubrication of joints. Water also helps to maintain homeostasis, a state in which the body's cellular and organ systems remain in balance. Furthermore, water is a key component in maintaining proper hydration levels, which are essential for survival. Without proper hydration, the body cannot survive for extended periods of time.",
