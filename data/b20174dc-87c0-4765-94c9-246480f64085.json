  "output": "One time I had to think outside the box was when I was working on a project and encountered a problem that nobody had encountered before. The problem seemed insurmountable, as no one had any ideas or solutions to the problem. Instead of giving up, I stepped back and looked at the problem from a different perspective. I realized that we could use a different approach to address the problem and it actually worked! That experience taught me the importance of being able to think outside the box and not give up when faced with a difficult challenge.",
