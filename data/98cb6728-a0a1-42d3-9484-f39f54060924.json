  "input": "",
  "output": "Parallel lines are two lines in a plane that never intersect and remain equidistant from each other at all times. The distance between two parallel lines never changes, regardless of how much the two lines are extended. Parallel lines are everywhere and can be described by their angle of inclination and the distance between them. They can also be used to identify intersecting shapes, such as triangles and squares, by making their sides, angles, and base equal to each other.",
