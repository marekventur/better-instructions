  "output": "Composting is the process of breaking down organic materials such as kitchen and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil. The process begins with the collection of organic materials, which can include vegetable and fruit peelings, coffee grounds, eggshells and newspaper. These materials are then added to a composting bin and mixed with oxygen, water, and other nutrients. After the bin is filled, the compost is left to decompose and are turned every few weeks to increase air circulation. Once the compost breaks down fully, it is ready to be used as a soil amendment to provide nutrients for plants and vegetables.",
