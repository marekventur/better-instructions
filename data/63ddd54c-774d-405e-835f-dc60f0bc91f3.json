  "output": "The red giant phase of a star is the next stage in its life cycle after the main sequence. It is characterized by a large luminosity, a decrease in surface temperature, and an extended radius which is tens of times as large as in the main sequence. During the red giant phase, the star fuses heavier elements like Carbon and Oxygen into heavier elements, eventually becoming a white dwarf or neutron star. Stars in the red giant phase are readily visible from Earth.",
