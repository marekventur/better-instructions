  "input": "Equity and debt",
  "output": "Equity and debt are two distinct sources of capital. Equity financing involves raising money from investors in exchange for a portion of ownership in the company, while debt financing involves taking out a loan to be paid back with interest. Equity financing has no obligation to pay back the money and offers more flexible terms, while debt financing provides a predictable and secured form of financing with predetermined interest payments, but carries a risk of being unable to pay back.",
