  "input": "",
  "output": "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder typically communicate using a variety of methods and techniques. For some, speech and language development may be delayed or absent and they may rely on alternative communication methods such as sign language, picture or object exchange, or augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. Others may benefit from augmenting their verbal communication with gestures, facial expressions, and body language. Facilitated communication, which is an intervention that enables individuals with ASD who have difficulty communicating to type or point to letters, words, or pictures to express themselves, may also be utilized.",
