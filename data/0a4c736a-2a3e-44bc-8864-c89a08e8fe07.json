  "output": "This code is a simple encryption function that takes a given string and a key as inputs. It then uses a loop to iterate through the characters of the message one by one. For each character, it adds the key to its ASCII value, resulting in a new character that is shifted by the key number of letters in the alphabet. The resulting encrypted message is then returned.",
