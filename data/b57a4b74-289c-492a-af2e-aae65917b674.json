  "input": "",
  "output": "Global warming is the gradual increase in average global temperatures due to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. It has been linked to a variety of global climate changes, including rising sea levels, changes in rainfall patterns, increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather, and habitat disruption. The consequences of global warming not only affect people's health and their lives, but also the environment, economies, and ecosystems. To mitigate the drastic effects of global warming, swift and decisive actions are needed to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, increase renewable energy sources, and promote sustainable lifestyles.",
