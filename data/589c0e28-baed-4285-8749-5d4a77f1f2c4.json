  "output": "Frankenstein is a classic novel written by Mary Shelley in 1818. The novel follows Victor Frankenstein, a scientist who has created an artificial creature by collecting body parts from corpses. After realizing how terrifying the creature is and how it is shunned by humanity, Frankenstein abandons it, leaving it angry and vengeful. The novel follows both the creature and Frankenstein as they come face to face with life circumstances, courage and moral dilemmas, and ultimately leads to a series of tragedies and redemption. Filled with emotions and suspense, Frankenstein is one of the earliest pieces of science-fiction, and it remains incredibly popular over 200 years after its publication.",
