  "output": "Felicia had always dreamed of attending the most prestigious school in the world. As she walked through the courtyard on the first day of classes at her new school, she felt the weight of a thousand possible futures, of possibilities and dreams resting on her fragile shoulders. \n\nBut when Felicia quickly realized that the wealthy students were often cruel, and the pressure to strive for perfect grades was ever present, she wondered if her dream had come at too great a cost. In a private moment of loneliness, Felicia wondered if she would be able to keep her values intact when so many of her friends were willing to do whatever it took to win.\n\nHowever, she quickly found solace and kinship in unexpected places, with the gardener and the cleaners cheering her on through each hurdle. With their support and her own willingness to fight for her beliefs, Felicia slowly but surely made a name for herself for her integrity and strength of moral character. With a newfound clarity and courage, she continued to pursue her goals and dreams, learning valuable lessons about distinguishing right from wrong as she went along.",
