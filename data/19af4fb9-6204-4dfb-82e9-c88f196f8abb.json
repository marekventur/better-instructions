  "instruction": "Describe how a military dictatorship changes a country.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A military dictatorship can have grave implications on the population and result in a massive shift in the country's political and social structure. The military typically suspend civil laws and civil liberties, erode democratic institutions, and quash dissent, leading to a lack of meaningful public engagement in the decision-making process. This can create a culture of fear and a weakening of civil society, and often leaves citizens under the rule of a single authoritarian leader.",
