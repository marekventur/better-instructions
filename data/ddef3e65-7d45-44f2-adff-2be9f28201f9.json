  "input": "",
  "output": "A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to determine whether an element is a member of a set. A Bloom filter can test whether an element has been previously added to the set with a high degree of accuracy. It works by creating a compact bit array that is used to store the elements in the set. An element is considered to be a member of the set if the bit array contains a certain value for that element, otherwise it is not. Bloom filters are used in many areas such as search engine optimization, spam filtering, databases and network routing.",
