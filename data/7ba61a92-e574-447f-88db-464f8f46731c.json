  "instruction": "Write an algorithm for switching five traffic lights.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm will consist of five steps. Firstly, the algorithm should establish the time periods for each of the five lights. Then, it should specify the duration of each light (red, amber or green). It should also specify the amount of time each light should stay illuminated for. Next, the algorithm should determine when the lights should switch to the next light. Finally, it should make sure the sequence runs smoothly and without any overlap between lights.",
