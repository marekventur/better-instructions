  "input": "",
  "output": "Linear regression and logistic regression are two commonly used statistical models. Linear regression is used to predict continuous values, such as predicting the price of a house or the sales of a product, while logistic regression is used to predict categorical values, such as predicting whether a person belongs to a certain group or predicting a person's gender. Linear regression takes a linear approach to modeling data, while logistic regression takes a non-linear approach by using a logistic (sigmoid) function to transform the target variable used in the model.",
