  "output": "Scenario 1: \nStay within the speed limit by setting your cruise control. Don't follow too closely behind other vehicles to avoid accidentally speeding. Be aware of the road and the speed limit signs to avoid any fines.\n\nScenario 2: \nIf a police officer tries to pull you over, it is important to remain calm and avoid any sudden movements. Put on your hazard lights and pull over to the side of the road. When talking to the officer, be polite and remain calm to demonstrate you were not trying to be reckless.",
