  "instruction": "Describe the unique characteristics of a dimpled golf ball.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A golf ball with dimples has hundreds of tiny indentations or bumps on its surface which creates greater aerodynamic drag, resulting in more lift and a longer flight. Dimpled golf balls also generate more backspin, resulting in improved accuracy and greater distance than those without dimples. The dimples also cause the ball to take a more erratic path, which is beneficial in avoiding obstacles or hazards. Dimples can also reduce the effects of lower temperature, wind, and precipitation on your ball, resulting in more predictable flight paths. Finally, the dimples diffuse light more effectively than a regular golf ball, making them easier to see and less susceptible to glare.",
