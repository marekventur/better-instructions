  "output": "Three differences between Open Source Software and Proprietary Software are: \n1. Open source software is made available publicly, for free, for anyone to modify and use, whereas proprietary software is only available to a few people or organizations after paying for access. \n2. With open source software, anyone can view the underlying source code and make changes, whereas proprietary software has restricted access to its source code. \n3. Open source software often relies on the collective effort of a community for its development and maintenance, whereas proprietary software is typically maintained and developed by a single organization.",
