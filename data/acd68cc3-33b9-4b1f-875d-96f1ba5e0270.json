  "instruction": "Given two equations write a sequence of steps to solve them.",
  "input": "Equation 1: 2x + y = 4\nEquation 2: y + x = 3",
  "output": "Steps to solve: \n1. Subtract x from both sides of equation 1: 2x + y = 4 \u2192 2x = 4 - y \n2. Subtract y from both sides of equation 2: y + x = 3 \u2192 x = 3 - y \n3. Substitute x from equation 2 into equation 1: 2x = 4 - y \u2192 2(3 - y) = 4 - y\n4. Simplify: 6 - 2y = 4 - y \n5. Add 2y to both sides: 6 = 2y + y\n6. Simplify: 6 = 3y\n7. Divide both sides by 3: y = 2 \n8. Substitute y into equation 2: x = 3 - 2 = 1 \nTherefore, x = 1, y = 2.",
