  "output": "Starting a business can be a daunting task, but it can be broken down into a few simple steps. First, decide what type of business you want to start and what products or services you will be offering. Next, do some research to determine the feasibility of your business idea and any potential legal aspects you need to be aware of. Then, create a business plan, secure funding (if needed), and register the business with your local government. Finally, develop the necessary systems and processes needed to get your business up and running.",
