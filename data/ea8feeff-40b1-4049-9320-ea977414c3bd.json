He was looking for something, but was not sure what. \nSuddenly, a firefly fluttered past him, lighting up the way. He followed it, and eventually came across a beautiful garden with colorful tulips blooming. It was a magical sight, and Peter knew that he had found what he was looking for. He smiled, knowing that this was a place he wanted to stay and explore.",
