  "input": "",
  "output": "In the past 5 years, film streaming has exploded in popularity. Streaming services like Netflix and Hulu have become household names and are easily accessible through smart TVs and streaming devices. This shift in viewing habits has changed the way people consume media, allowing them to watch whatever they want and when they want. This has also opened up opportunities for independent filmmakers to create content and reach larger audiences. More recently, streaming services are releasing their own content, giving them more control over the production, marketing, and distribution. As streaming continues to increase in popularity, more companies are entering the market, giving people more streaming options than ever before.",
