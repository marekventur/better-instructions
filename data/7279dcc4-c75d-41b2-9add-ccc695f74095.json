  "output": "In physics, gravity is a force that exists between any two objects that have mass. It is this force that causes things to fall to the ground and is responsible for holding the planets in orbit around the sun. Gravity is an attractive force, meaning that objects that are close together will be pulled towards each other, while objects that are further apart will be pulled less strongly.",
