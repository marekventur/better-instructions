  "output": "Dreams are the light that guide us through,\nShowing us what really can come true.\nThey always give us hope and convey,\nA future that is ours to create.\n\nDreams can take us on a journey,\nTo places we could have never seen,\nExploring through our deepest thoughts,\nEmbarking on adventures beyond.\n\nDreams are often things we fear,\nWith all the risks that come along.\nBut should we not reap their rewards,\nFear of failure will be gone.\n\nDreams are always meant to be shared,\nAs though we're wearing someone else's shoes.\nFor they will never betray us,\nAnd always lift us up.",
