  "instruction": "Describe the concept of modular programming",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Modular programming is an approach to software development that subdivides a system into smaller, self-contained components known as modules. Each module is responsible for a specific functionality of the system, and they are loosely coupled, meaning that changes to one module may not require changes to other modules. Thus, each module is self-contained and can be developed, tested, and maintained independently of the other modules. Modular programming also allows for greater scalability, as new modules can be added to the system at any time. Finally, modular programming can help improve code quality, as it encourages code reuse, code readability, and more efficient debugging.",
