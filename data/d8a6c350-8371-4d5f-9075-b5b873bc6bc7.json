  "output": "I walked into the forest, feeling the wet grass between my toes. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and the sun sparkled through the branches as I walked deeper and deeper into the forest. As I went, I heard a faint sound, like singing, coming from deeper within. I followed the sound until I reached a clearing and saw a small cottage in the center. I knocked on the door and a kindly old woman answered. She welcomed me in and I realized that she was the source of the singing, and that she was a witch who lived in the forest. From then on, she became my teacher and I learned many wonderful things from her.",
