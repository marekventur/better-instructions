  "instruction": "Design a game to teach students about conservation efforts.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The game should involve both educational and entertainment aspects, in order to motivate students to learn about conservation efforts. The game should involve elements such as puzzles, challenge levels, and narrative elements.\n\nThe game should also provide educational content about conservation. This can include information about conservation initiatives and the benefits of protecting species and minimizing human impact on the environment. The game should also have interactive elements such as quizzes, mini-games, and simulations in order to reinforce the educational content. \n\nThe game should also allow students to design their own eco-friendly solutions, such as creating their own renewable energy sources or designing a protected area for endangered species. They should also be rewarded for their efforts in the game and be able to compare their successes with other players.",
