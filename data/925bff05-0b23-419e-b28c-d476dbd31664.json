  "output": "The invention process for a new machine generally involves designing, prototyping, and testing the product. Designing begins with brainstorming and research to determine the purpose of the machine and the key components that need to be included in the design. Prototyping is the process of creating a model of the machine to see if it meets the desired specifications and functions as expected. Finally, the prototype must be tested to make sure it works and is safe for consumers to use, and any bugs must be worked out before the machine is ready to launch.",
