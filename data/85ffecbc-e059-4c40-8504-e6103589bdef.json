  "output": "In statistics, the sum of squares is a measure of the variance of a sample. It is calculated by summing the squared deviations of each sample from its mean value. This measure is also known as squared Euclidean distance and it is an important metric in measuring the differences between samples in terms of their expected differences. The sum of squares can be used to measure the amount of variation within a dataset and to gauge the differences between groups of data.",
