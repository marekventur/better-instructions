  "output": "Once upon a time there was a farmer who was out tending to his crops and gathering firewood. As he went about his work, he stumbled upon an old, dusty lamp in some tall grass. He picked it up and brushed off the dirt from its surface. Suddenly, a loud and booming voice filled the air.\n\n\"Greetings, oh mighty farmer,\" the voice said. \"I am a genie and I have been trapped within this lamp for centuries. I will grant you three wishes - anything your heart desires!\"\n\nThe farmer was both shocked and amazed at the genie's words. After a few moments to take it all in, he began to think about how he could use his three wishes. He wished for wealth, health, and happiness - all of which the genie granted without fail. From that moment onwards, the farmer's life changed and he began to experience all the joys that life had to offer.\n\nThe farmer was forever grateful to the genie and they parted ways as the farmer wished him a long and happy life. The farmer never forgot the day he found the old and dusty lamp in the tall grass and the genie who granted him his three wishes.",
