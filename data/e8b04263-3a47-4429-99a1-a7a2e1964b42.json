  "output": "When designing a website with a user-friendly interface, certain principles should be kept in mind. The website should be organized in a logical manner and should provide clear navigation. Content should be concise and readable, and the overall design should be clean and uncluttered. Pages should load quickly, and stand out features should be highlighted in a visually engaging way. Forms should be concise, and input should be clearly labeled so that users know how to properly fill them out. Additionally, the website should be designed to be responsive so that it can be viewed on all devices.",
