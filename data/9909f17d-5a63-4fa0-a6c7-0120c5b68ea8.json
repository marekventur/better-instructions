  "output": "My living room is bright and cozy, with comfy couches and chairs. The walls are painted a warm shade of yellow and there is a large rug in the middle of the room. There are pictures in frames on the walls and bookshelves filled with books. The room has plenty of natural light that streams through the windows and highlights the various wooden furniture. It's the perfect spot to relax and enjoy a good book or movie with family and friends.",
