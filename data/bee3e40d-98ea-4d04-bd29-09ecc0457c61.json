  "output": "Life insurance provides financial protection for your family in the event of your death so that they can maintain their lifestyle and be financially secure. It pays a lump sum which can be invested and used to replace lost income. Life insurance can also be used for specific goals, such as saving for college tuition, paying off debt, and making sure your spouse and children are provided for if you die unexpectedly. Finally, life insurance can be used as a tax-sheltered asset that can provide a legacy of wealth to future generations.",
