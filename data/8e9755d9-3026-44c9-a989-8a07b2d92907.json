In another bowl, combine 1/3 cup of softened butter, 1 egg, 1/3 cup of white sugar, 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1 mashed banana and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, melt 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips and allow to cool. Then, add the butter mixture, chocolate mixture and flour mixture together. Fill each muffin cup with the batter and top with extra banana slices and chocolate chips. Bake for 16-18 minutes and enjoy the delicious taste of these warm, chocolatey and banana muffins.",
