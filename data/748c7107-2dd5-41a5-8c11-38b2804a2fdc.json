  "instruction": "Evaluate the effectiveness of two recent digital marketing campaigns.",
  "input": "The two campaigns were aimed at promoting products to a target audience of 18-30 year olds.",
  "output": "The effectiveness of the two recent digital marketing campaigns should be evaluated by looking at various metrics such as reach, engagement, and conversions. The reach of the campaigns should be analysed to see how many people in the target audience were exposed to the advertisement. The engagement with the advertisement should also be looked at, such as likes, comments, shares, and any other interactions. Lastly, the conversion rate should be looked at to evaluate how effective the campaigns were in driving sales or leads.",
