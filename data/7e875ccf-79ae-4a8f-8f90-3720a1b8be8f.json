  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to improve the user experience of an online banking website would be to provide more personalization options. For example, customers could be able to customize the homepage layout, choose which accounts they want displayed, the window size of accounts, etc. Having the ability to customize their view would make the website more interactive and easier to use. \n\nAnother way to improve the user experience would be to integrate some educational features for customers, such as providing tips and advice about budgeting, savings and understanding interest rates. Being able to access interactive bank simulations and quizzes would also be beneficial for customers to get a better understanding of banking. \n\nFinally, providing customers with more account options could also improve their user experience and give them more control over their accounts. For example, option to switch from one account type to another would allow customers to better align their accounts with their needs.",
