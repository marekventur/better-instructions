  "output": "Vaccinations are an important part of protecting children from serious illnesses.  Vaccinations help build immunity against diseases by introducing a weakened or inactive form of a virus or bacteria into the body. This allows the body to recognize the virus or bacteria and be better equipped to fight it off if it is ever encountered again. By getting vaccinated, children can protect not only themselves, but their friends, family, and community from these dangerous diseases. Vaccines provide a safe and effective way to help prevent many illnesses and protect future generations.",
