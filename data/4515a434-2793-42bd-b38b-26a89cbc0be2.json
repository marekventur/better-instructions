  "input": "",
  "output": "A semiconductor is a material that has properties between a conductor and an insulator. This means that they allow some electrical current to flow under certain conditions and block electric current at other times. They are also known as a type of resistive material because electric current can only flow through them if a small force is applied. Semiconductors are used in a wide range of electronic devices, such as transistors, diodes, switches, and solar cells. Semiconductors can be made with various elements or compounds and their properties vary depending on how they were constructed. Some examples of semiconductor properties are their ability to conduct or block electrical current, their resistance to electrical current, and their ability to produce heat when electricity passes through them.",
