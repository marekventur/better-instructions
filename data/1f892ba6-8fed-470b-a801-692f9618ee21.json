  "instruction": "Construct an algorithm that finds all prime numbers up to a given upper limit.",
  "input": "Upper limit = 20",
  "output": "Step 1: Set a counter equal to 2 (the first prime number).\nStep 2: Check if the number is divisible by any other number between 2 and the counter (inclusively).\nStep 3: If not, print out the number as it is a prime number.\nStep 4: Increment the counter by 1 and go back to Step 2.\nStep 5: When the counter reaches the upper limit (20), then stop the algorithm. Output: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.",
