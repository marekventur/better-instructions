  "output": "The soldier returned home after months abroad, expecting to be welcomed back by elated family and friends. Instead, he was welcomed by a deafening silence. His eyes shifted from one side of the street to the other, hoping that such a bleak display was merely an envelopment of a warm and joyous reunion, yet nothing stirred within him. His heart was downcast as he slowly made his way up the cobblestone path and through the door. \n\nHe entered the home, looking for the familiar faces he had so desperately wished to see, but everything felt empty and unfamiliar. The soldier searched through the house for anyone, aggressively widening the parameters of his search, yet no one was home. He slowly crept upstairs and stepped into his childhood room. Peering out the window, he spotted a group of people, his family and friends, chatting around the garden.\n\nThe soldier moved slowly towards them, his heart pounding and his gaze shifting from one person to another. As he approached, there was a momentary and awkward pause, then the crowd erupted in a booming applause and shouts of elation. Everyone crowded around him, wrapping him in hugs, cheeks wet with tears of joy and happiness. \n\nThe soldier had come home.",
