  "instruction": "Create an algorithm for recognizing handwritten numbers using a convolutional neural network",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm should involve the following steps: \n1. Pre-process the input data by resizing and normalizing the images. \n2. Define and design the CNN architecture with the right number of layers and nodes. \n3. Train the CNN on a labeled training dataset of handwritten numbers.\n4. Test and validate the model on a test dataset. \n5. Deploy the model in a production environment with capabilities for continuous retraining. \n6. Monitor the performance of the model with metrics such as accuracy and recall.",
