  "input": "",
  "output": "Query optimization is the process of improving the speed and efficiency of a database query. This is done by analyzing the query, breaking it into smaller sections, and modifying the code or query structure to reduce the amount of resources required to complete the query. This can include removing unnecessary filters, restructuring the query to make use of available indexes, or re-writing the query to use a more efficient method of execution.",
