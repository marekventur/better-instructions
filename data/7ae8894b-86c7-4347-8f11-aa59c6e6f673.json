  "output": "Giorno's is a wonderful Italian restaurant located in the city. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with a warm and inviting service staff. The food is freshly prepared and always delicious. The menu offers a wide range of Italian dishes and they always seem to hit the spot! My favorite dish that I have sampled so far is the Pizza Margherita. It is perfectly cooked with crispy cheese and a fantastic tomato sauce. I highly recommend Giorno's to anyone looking for a tasty Italian treat!",
