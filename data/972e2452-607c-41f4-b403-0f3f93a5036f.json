  "output": "The two works of art depict the same subject matter - a figure in a contemplative pose - but they differ in style. The painting on the left has a more impressionistic quality with its softer colors and less-defined outline. The painting on the right has a more abstract expressionistic style with its more vivid colors, more defined outline and more aggressive brush strokes.",
