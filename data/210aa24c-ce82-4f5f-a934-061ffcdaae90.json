  "output": "A computer is like a big calculator that can do lots of different things. It has a brain that helps it store and process information. Inside there are many parts, like a motherboard, memory chip, hard drive and CPU. The CPU tells the computer what to do, like open a game or type a report. To the outside, the user can interact with a computer through input devices like a keyboard and mouse, and get information out of it through output devices like a monitor and speakers.",
