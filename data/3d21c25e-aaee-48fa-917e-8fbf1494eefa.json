  "input": "Behaviorism and constructivism",
  "output": "The differences between behaviorism and constructivism are numerous. Behaviorism focuses on observable behavior and has traditionally been used in laboratory experiments. Constructivism is based on the idea that knowledge is constructed by learners, as opposed to simply being received. Behaviorism views knowledge as existing in the environment, while constructivism proposes that knowledge is actively constructed by the learner. Behaviorism concentrates on discrete units of behavior, while constructivism favors a holistic approach that emphasizes relationships between elements.",
