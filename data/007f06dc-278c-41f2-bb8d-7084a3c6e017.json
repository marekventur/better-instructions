  "instruction": "Create a function that will calculate the area of a triangle.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The function should take in the three sides of a triangle as parameters and then use the Heron\u2019s Formula to calculate the area. The formula is as follows: Area = \u221ap(p-a)(p-b)(p-c) where p is the semiperimeter or half of the perimeter of the triangle and a, b, c are the three side lengths.",
