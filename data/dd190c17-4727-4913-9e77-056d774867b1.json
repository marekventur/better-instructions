  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a magical creature that lived deep in the mystical forest. It was called the Nodbris, and it had the most beautiful wings in all of the land. Whenever it flew, it left a beautiful multi-colored trail of sparkles in its wake. It also had the ability to grant wishes to any creature that found it.\n\nOne day, a brave knight ventured into the forest in search of adventure. He encountered the Nodbris and was astonished by its beauty. He asked the creature for a wish and, after careful consideration, the Nodbris granted the knight's wish of becoming the strongest warrior in the world. \n\nThe knight thanked the Nodbris, and it flew off into the sky, leaving behind its trail of sparkles. From that day forward, the knight was known throughout the land as the most powerful fighter. \n\nYears later, the Nodbris has been largely forgotten, but its sparkles can still be seen in the sky every night.",
