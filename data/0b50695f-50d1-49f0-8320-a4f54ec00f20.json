  "input": "",
  "output": "A pilot study is a small version of a full study and is typically used to test the feasibility of the research design, data collection methods, and instruments before launching a full study. A pilot study allows researchers to identify potential issues before they conduct the full study and to make any modifications that might be necessary. In contrast, a full study is the full-fledged version of the research. It typically involves more participants and a more comprehensive data collection and analysis process, and often includes multiple phases.",
