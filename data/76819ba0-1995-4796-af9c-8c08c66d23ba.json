  "input": "",
  "output": "In statistics, there are two types of relationships between two or more variables: linear and curvilinear. Linear relationships are characterized by a straight line and are found when there is a direct, proportional relationship between two variables. Curvilinear relationships, however, involve a curved line and occur when variables have an indirect, non-proportional relationship. Curvilinear relationships can be further divided into polynomial and exponential relationships, depending on the nature of the curve. Linear relationships are easier to interpret than curvilinear relationships, as they only involve one slope and one intercept value, while curvilinear relationships involve more complex curves and can be difficult to interpret. Despite this, curvilinear relationships can tell us more information than linear relationships and can be useful when trying to explain the data more thoroughly.",
