  "instruction": "Act as a tutor to an elementary student who needs help understanding how to add two fractions.",
  "input": "7/9 + 4/5",
  "output": "Great question! Adding fractions is easy when they have the same denominator. To find the sum of 7/9 and 4/5, we first need to find a common denominator between the two fractions. The lowest common denominator is 45, so we convert both fractions to 45ths. 7/9 becomes 35/45, and 4/5 becomes 36/45. Now that we have the same denominator, we can add the numerators to get the sum. The sum of 35/45 and 36/45 is 71/45.",
