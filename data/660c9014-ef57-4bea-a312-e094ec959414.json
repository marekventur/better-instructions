  "output": "The nitrogen cycle is the process of nitrogen being exchanged between living organisms and their environment. \n\nOne example is nitrification. This is the process of bacteria converting ammonia and nitrites into nitrates, which are usable by plants. This process occurs in both soil, aquatic environments, and the atmosphere. The nitrate is then taken up by the plants, which can then be consumed by animals.\n\nAnother example is denitrification which occurs in soil environments. This is the process of bacteria converting nitrates into nitrogen gas which is released back into the atmosphere. \n\nLastly, nitrogen fixation is a process that occurs in aquatic and soil environments. This is the process of lightning and bacteria converting nitrogen gas into an inert form, such as ammonia, which can then be converted into nitrates by the same bacteria for use by plants. \n\nThese 3 types of processes make up the nitrogen cycle which is vital in sustaining life on earth.",
