  "instruction": "Analyze the following statement and explain what is wrong with it.",
  "input": "Statement: \"All politicians are lies.\"",
  "output": "The statement \"All politicians are lies\" is an overly generalizing statement without basis. It is wrong to make an assumption that all politicians are liars as it is too broad and subjective. Not all politicians are liars, and it is unfair to judge an entire group of people in such a negative way.",
