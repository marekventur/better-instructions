  "instruction": "List the causes of air pollution.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The main causes of air pollution are burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, agricultural activities, industrial activities, atmospheric reactions, and transportation. Burning of fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, which is a green house gas, as well as other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. Deforestation leads to fewer trees playing their role in absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing Oxygen. Agricultural activities lead to release of ammonia and other chemicals used in the farming process. Industrial activities lead to emissions of dangerous gases such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide. Atmospheric reactions produce ozone and photochemical smog. Transportation is a major cause of air pollution in cities, due to the burning of fossil fuels.",
