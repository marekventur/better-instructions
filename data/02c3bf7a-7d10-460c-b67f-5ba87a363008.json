  "output": "In order to get a driver's license in Canada, you will first need to complete a driver's education program, such as a drivers permit course. After you have done this, you will be able to register for the written and practical driving tests, which you must pass in order to get your driver's license. To prepare for the tests, you should study the provincial driving regulations and practice driving on a quiet road or an empty parking lot. After you have passed the written and practical tests, you will receive your driver's license and be able to legally drive in Canada.",
