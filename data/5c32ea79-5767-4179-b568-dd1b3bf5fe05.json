  "input": "Expectant Mothers",
  "output": "This wellness plan for expectant mothers should include strategies for physical, emotional and mental health. Physical health should include exercise, a healthy diet and adequate rest. Expectant mothers should strive for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise such as walking or swimming every day. A nutritious diet should include a variety of fruits, vegetables and proteins. Adequate sleep is essential for the body and mind to recharge, so make sure to get seven to eight hours per night. \n\nStress management is important for emotional and mental health. This can include mindfulness activities, journaling or talking to a friend. Participating in activities like yoga, meditation or guided visualization can also be beneficial. Make sure to take time every day to treat yourself, whether it be by getting a massage or simply taking a long bubble bath.\n \nMake sure to take prenatal vitamins as prescribed by your doctor and attend all of your obstetrician checkups. It's also important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Schedule regular check-ins with your doctor to ensure the health of both you and your baby.",
