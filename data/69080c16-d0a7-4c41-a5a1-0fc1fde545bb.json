  "input": "",
  "output": "A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that can be used to recognize patterns in data. It is made up of interconnected nodes (also known as \u201cneurons\u201d). Each node is connected to each other and forms a network. The neural network receives an input which is processed in order to derive an output. The input is multiplied by a weight and then passed through a non-linear activation function. The output is then compared to the desired output in order to determine the accuracy of the neural network and identify areas for improvement.",
