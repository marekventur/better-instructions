  "output": "Living on Mars is a unique experience. Every day, you get to witness stunningly beautiful views of the red and orange terrains that stretch before you. You rise to the light of two suns, and you can see the stars twinkle in the night sky with every setting. In the warmth of the sun, you walk around and explore the planet, discovering its peculiarities and marveling at its wonders. You can even feel the gentle gravitational pull of the planet, which is quite different from Earth\u2019s. On those days where you feel like at home, you can even take a nap in your sleeping quarters and dream of the possibilities in this strange land.",
