  "input": "",
  "output": "Organizing a desk for maximum productivity starts with clearing all surface areas and reducing clutter. Only keep items that are used on a regular basis out in the open. Then, create space-saving organization solutions to hold pens and other small items. Separate items into \u2018action,\u2019 \u2018trash,\u2019 and \u2018file\u2019 piles, to stay on top of paperwork. Finally, put items that you need access to the most, like your phone and a notepad, in a convenient area to reduce stress and stay focused.",
