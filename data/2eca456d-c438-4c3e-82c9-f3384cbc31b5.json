  "input": "",
  "output": "A great recipe for a vegan dinner party would be a Rainbow Buddha Bowl. This recipe requires cooked quinoa, roasted vegetables, cubed tofu, and a homemade dressing. To prepare the roasted vegetables, combine bell peppers, zucchini, onion, and cauliflower with a drizzle of olive oil, garlic powder, and pepper in a large bowl, then spread it on a baking sheet. Bake in a preheated oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes, and then set aside. Boil the quinoa and set aside. Cube the tofu and season it with garlic powder, pepper, and soy sauce. Finally, prepare a sauce for the bowl by blending together tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil. Serve all components in a bowl and enjoy!",
