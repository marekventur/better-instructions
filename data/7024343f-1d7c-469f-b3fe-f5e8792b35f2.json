  "instruction": "Generate two arguments debating whether or not a country should ban single-use plastic.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Argument 1: A country should ban single-use plastic in order to reduce environmental pollution. Single-use plastics are a major source of plastic pollution, and that pollution is severely impacting ecosystems and threatening human health. A ban will limit landfill accumulation and slow down ocean pollution by eliminating the disposable plastics that are most commonly discarded. \n\nArgument 2: A country should not ban single-use plastic because it would have a negative economic impact. Plastic is used everywhere and has become a large part of the global economy. A ban would be difficult to enforce, and it would cause significant losses in income and jobs. Furthermore, it would lead to a rise in the cost of goods and services, which would disproportionally affect low-income communities.",
