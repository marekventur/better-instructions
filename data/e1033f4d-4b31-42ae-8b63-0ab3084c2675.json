This is becoming a serious issue.\u201d \n\nThe Mother chimes in, \u201cYes, it is. We can help make a difference by recycling more and being conscious of the things we buy and our transportation choices.\u201d \n\nThe oldest child, a boy, pipes up, \u201cI can help by picking up any garbage I see while out at the park or walking down the street.\u201d \n\nThe youngest child, a girl, adds, \u201cI can turn off the lights when I leave the room and take shorter showers\u201d \n\nThe Father smiles and concludes, \u201cGreat ideas. We can all work together to make a difference in the environment.\u201d  The screen fades out with the family smiling.",
