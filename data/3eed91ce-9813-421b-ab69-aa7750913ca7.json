  "output": "Dolphins and whales are both members of the Cetacean family, however, they have many differences. First, dolphins are usually smaller than whales and have a more playful demeanor. Second, dolphins are air-breathing marine mammals that live in shallow waters and near coasts, whereas whales inhabit deeper ocean areas. Finally, dolphins have a more varied diet and are more social animals, whereas whales usually travel and feed alone.",
