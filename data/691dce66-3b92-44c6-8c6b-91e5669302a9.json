  "input": "",
  "output": "The Chinese Room Argument is a thought experiment in the philosophy of artificial intelligence which is used to challenge the notion that a digital computer can have a mind, understand language, or have a consciousness. It is argued that if a machine were programmed with a set of rules to manipulate symbols that it could never truly understand the input. This is because, even if it produces a meaningful output, it is only following the rules and has no \"understanding\" of the language.",
