  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Choose a suitable location that gets enough sunlight and has sufficient soil and a clear water supply. \n2. Dig a hole that is at least twice as wide as the root ball of the tree, and equal in depth.\n3. Place the tree in the hole and spread out its roots gently, taking care not to damage them. \n4. Partially fill in the hole with soil, tamping it down gently and making sure there are no air pockets. \n5. Water the dirt that surrounds the tree's roots to help them expand and settle in the soil.\n6. Finish filling the hole with soil, leaving a shallow trench to capture water while it drains. \n7. Cover the exposed roots with a few inches of soil, but avoid over-packing the dirt. \n8. Place the tree in the established trench and use grass clippings, straw and mulch to help trap moisture and protect the roots. \n9. Water the tree and root ball regularly during the first few months- at least once every week for younger trees and as often as every few days for some species.\n10. Fertilize the tree with a recommended fertilizer type and in prescribed amounts.",
