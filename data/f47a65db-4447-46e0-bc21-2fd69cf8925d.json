  "instruction": "Create a system to detect when an email message is a scam.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The system would be able to detect when an email message is a scam by using machine learning techniques. It would analyze incoming emails for various pieces of information, such as the sender's address, the language used in the message, the links provided, and the content of the message. This information would then be compared with a database of known scam emails to determine the likelihood that the email is a scam. The system would also be able to detect any discrepancies in the message, such as incorrect messages of urgency or typos, that could indicate that the message is a scam. Additionally, the system could also be programmed with warning thresholds, so it can alert users when the likelihood of a scam message reaches a certain point.",
