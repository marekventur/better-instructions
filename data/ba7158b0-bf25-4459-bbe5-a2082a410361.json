  "output": "The article \u2018How COVID-19 is reshaping the global economy\u2019 explains that COVID-19 has caused the largest-ever contraction in the global economy, with countries around the world experiencing a significant drop in production, employment, and consumption. In an effort to mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic, governments have pumped trillions of dollars into the economy through stimulus packages, but this is not enough to counter the loss of business revenues. The article also highlights two major long-term changes in the global economy as a result of the pandemic: an acceleration of digital transformation, and a shift to more localized, resilient economies. The article emphasizes that while it\u2019s too soon to know the full effect of COVID-19 on the world economy, it is clear that the pandemic is ushering in meaningful and lasting changes.",
