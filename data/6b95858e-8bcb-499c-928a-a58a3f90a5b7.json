  "input": "",
  "output": "One strategy to reduce water waste is to implement water-saving appliances in homes and businesses. Water-efficient devices such as low-flow toilets and faucets, water-efficient washing machines, and drought-tolerant plants can significantly reduce overall water use indoors and outdoors. Additionally, instituting an effective water conservation plan, such as fixing any leaky pipes, collect rainwater in cisterns, and promoting responsible water management practices can help reduce water waste.",
