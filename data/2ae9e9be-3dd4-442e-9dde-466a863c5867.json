  "output": "Freedom is my destiny, living life with liberty. Chains broken, run wild and free, living on my own decree. Soaring high, nothing to fear, claiming what is rightfully mine. Nobody controls my life, breakin' out and makin' it right. Follow not a master's plan, livin' life with my own hand. Fate is mine, the power is mine, livin' in a world that's divine. Making moves and changin' the game, livin' with the freedom I claim.",
