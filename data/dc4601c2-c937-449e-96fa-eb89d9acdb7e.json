I'm so excited for what's to come.\"\n\nJohn smiled. \"Me too. We'll still have some of our favorite websites, because people will always need to stay connected. But the internet won't just be about connecting with people \u2013 it could be used for entertainment, shopping, education, and more. We may even find that the internet becomes our primary source of information and knowledge.\"\n\nSarah nodded, dreamy-eyed. \"I'm sure it'll be amazing.\"\n\nJohn and Sarah couldn't contain their excitement, both sure that the future was going to be full of incredible opportunities.",
