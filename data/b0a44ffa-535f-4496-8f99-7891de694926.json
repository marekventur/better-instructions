  "input": "",
  "output": "Three psychological theories on decision-making are the rational choice theory, the heuristics theory, and the bounded rationality theory. The rational choice theory states that people make decisions based on predicted outcomes, while the heuristics theory states that people make decisions based on mental shortcuts or rules of thumb. The bounded rationality theory states that decision-making is limited by the cognitive limitations of the individual, as well as the uniqueness of the situation.",
