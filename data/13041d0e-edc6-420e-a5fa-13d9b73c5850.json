  "output": "My advice to someone looking for a new job is to start by creating a list of companies that you are interested in working with. Then, research each company thoroughly so that you can prepare to demonstrate your knowledge and enthusiasm during the recruitment process. Furthermore, it is important to devote time to perfecting your resume and cover letter to make sure you are making the best first impression possible. Additionally, practice for interviews so that you can feel confident and speak about your qualifications with ease. Lastly, make sure to follow up with employers after the interview to stay top of mind in their search for a new hire.",
