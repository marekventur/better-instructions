  "output": "Three activities related to non-relational database design are (1) understanding the data model and use cases, (2) designing the data storage structure, and (3) testing for data integrity. Understanding the data model and use cases involves understanding how the data is organized and how it will be used. Designing the data storage structure involves planning how the data will be organized and stored according to the use cases. Testing for data integrity involves validating data integrity while the data is being stored and retrieved.",
