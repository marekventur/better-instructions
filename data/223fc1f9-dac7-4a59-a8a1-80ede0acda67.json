  "instruction": "Pick one of the following organisms and explain how it is adapted to its environment.",
  "input": "Blue Whale",
  "output": "The Blue Whale is a large, pelagic marine mammal with several adaptations that enable it to live in the open ocean. It has a huge tail to propel it forward, a streamlined body to reduce drag, and a network of blubber to keep it warm. The whale's blowhole is located at the top of its head, allowing it to take in air without having to stop and surface. Its extra wide mouth helps it to filter large amounts of ocean water and krill in a single gulp. Its powerful sonar enables it to navigate the environment, find prey, and send out sound communication.",
