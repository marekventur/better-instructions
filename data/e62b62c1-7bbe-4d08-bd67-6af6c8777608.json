  "output": "One creative way to promote a business is to create a branded scavenger hunt. The key to a successful scavenger hunt is to have a creative and engaging theme that ties back to the business\u2019s mission and identity. The scavenger hunt can be done through a website, or it can be set up with physical clues in the local area so that the players must visit your physical location to solve the clues. To encourage people to participate, you could also offer prizes for people who complete the scavenger hunt.",
