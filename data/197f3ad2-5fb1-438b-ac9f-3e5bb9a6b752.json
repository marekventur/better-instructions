  "input": "",
  "output": "No, artificial intelligence does not eliminate the need for human intelligence. While the advances in AI have allowed machines to learn, think, and act independently, machines still rely on humans to provide knowledge, data, and context. Artificial intelligence can be used as a tool to help humans become more efficient, productive, and creative, but it cannot replace human intelligence.",
