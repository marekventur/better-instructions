  "output": "I would design a superhero with the power of telepathy, called \u201cThe Mind Reader\u201d. This hero would be able to read, understand, and manipulate the thoughts of others and communicate using telepathy. They would be able to read the thoughts of others to discover secrets, track enemies, and relay information. They could also use their telepathic abilities to manipulate the minds of others and control their behavior. This power could have the potential to be used for good or evil depending on the user\u2019s moral alignment.",
