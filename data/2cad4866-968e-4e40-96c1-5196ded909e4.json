  "instruction": "Given two equations, explain how they are similar and how they are different.",
  "input": "x + 2y = 7\n2x + 4y = 14",
  "output": "The equations are similar in that they both have a linear relationship; both equations contain two variables, x and y, and can be graphed as a line. The equations are different in that the coefficients of the variables are different; the first equation has a coefficient of 1 for x and 2 for y, while the second equation has a coefficient of 2 for x and 4 for y.",
