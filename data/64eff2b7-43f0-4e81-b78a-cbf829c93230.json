  "output": "Building a professional portfolio involves creating a balanced mix of representative samples that showcase your skills and accomplishments. An important first step is to select a portfolio platform. Once the platform is selected, create a profile page to give a high-level overview of your experience. \n\nThe next step is to identify the types of items you want to include, such as resume, cover letter, work samples, letters of recommendation, certifications, awards and other relevant materials. Once you have compiled the items, organize them so that a viewer can easily navigate the page and quickly understand your accomplishment, expertise and career highlights. It\u2019s also important to keep the portfolio updated with your latest achievements.\n\nFinally, consider adding a professional headshot and designing the portfolio to reflect your personal style and brand. Once you are satisfied with the design of the portfolio, be sure to share it with your professional contacts and networks.",
