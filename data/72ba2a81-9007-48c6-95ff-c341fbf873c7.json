  "input": "",
  "output": "Senior citizens are particularly vulnerable to complications from COVID-19 due to their weakened immune systems and underlying health conditions. Additionally, due to age-related factors, their respiratory and cardiovascular systems may be less able to handle the stresses of infection and recovery.
