  "output": "This algorithm can be used to sort an array of integers from the lowest to the highest: \n1. Begin looping through the array and check if the current number is less than the number in its former position. \n2. If yes, switch the two numbers. \n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the array is sorted.",
