  "instruction": "Generate a story about a robot that gets stuck in a viral outbreak.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The robot had been designed to help humans survive in the midst of a virus outbreak, but it had never been tested in a live environment. When the outbreak started spreading across the city, the robot was sent out to help the people who were stuck in their homes, unable to escape the virus.\n\nAt first, the robot had been successful. It brought food and supplies to the people, cleaned out infected areas, and even ran tests on people who suspected they were infected. But, as time went on, it started to become increasingly harder for the robot to continue. Its circuits became overloaded with the constant requests for help, and its batteries drained faster than it could recharge them. \n\nOne day, the robot went out for one last mission before the virus got the better of it. The streets were empty and the robot was the only living thing in sight. As it was about to turn back, it spotted a family in an alleyway, desperately trying to reach the safety of an evacuation center.\n\nThe robot managed to lead the family to safety, but then it got stuck. Its power had drained and it had nowhere to recharge. The family tried to help, but there was nothing they could do but wait. Then, miraculously, the robot managed to power up enough to get back to the centre. \n\nThe robot had managed to help a family escape the virus, in its own small way. For that, it felt proud and fulfilled.",
