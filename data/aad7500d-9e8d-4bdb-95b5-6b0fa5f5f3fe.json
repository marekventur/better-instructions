  "input": "",
  "output": "The advantages of using solar energy include renewable and clean energy sources, lower electricity bills, low maintenance costs and availability of sunlight nearly everywhere. The main disadvantage is that it is not always the most economical option in the short-term and requires significant upfront investments, and is limited in availability during cloudy or snowy days. Solar energy is also affected by changes in the environment, such as dust, and is not as reliable or cost-effective in rural, mountainous or desert areas with limited access to sunlight.",
