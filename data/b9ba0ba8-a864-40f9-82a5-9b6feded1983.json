  "output": "The two most popular ways to make coffee are through a drip coffee machine and a French press. A drip coffee machine is relatively easy to use and allows you to quickly brew a large batch of coffee at once. You simply fill up the machine with water, add coffee grounds to the filter, and start the machine. The French press is more time consuming, but it offers unparalleled flavor and aroma. To use a French press, you need to measure out the correct amount of coffee grounds and water, stir them together, and wait for a few minutes. Once the mixture is ready, you plunge the filter down and remove the grounds from the liquid. The result is a full-bodied and flavorful cup of coffee.",
