  "instruction": "Elaborate on the principle of the lever using appropriate physics terminology.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The principle of the lever is based on the law of the lever, which states that the mechanical advantage of a lever is equal to the ratio between the length of its effort arm and the weight arm. The effort arm is the distance between the pivot point and where the effort is applied. The weight arm is the distance between the pivot point and the object to be moved. The same force applied to different lengths of arms produces different amounts of output force. As such, the lever increases the force exerted on an object by multiplying the effort force with the ratio of the arm lengths.",
