  "input": "",
  "output": "The four components of Object-Oriented Design are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism. Abstraction is the process of creating a representation of a real-world entity or problem that highlights the important details and eliminates irrelevant data. Encapsulation is the packaging of data and methods that act on the data into a single unit or object. Inheritance helps to reduce the duplication of code and promote reusability by allowing classes to inherit behavior from a parent class. Polymorphism allows for different objects of the same type to respond to the same message, in different ways.",
