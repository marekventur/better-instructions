Preprocessing steps for the email text such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. \n2. Feature extraction methods from the email text such as term frequency-inverse document frequency and n-grams.\n3. Supervised learning algorithms (e.g. logistic regression or SVM) for training a model on the extracted features.\n4. A metric to measure the performance of the model. \n5. Methods for periodically updating the model with new data.",
