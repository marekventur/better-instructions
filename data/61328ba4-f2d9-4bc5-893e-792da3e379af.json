  "input": "",
  "output": "AI can be used to help solve complex problems such as disease diagnosis, natural language understanding, autonomous vehicles, and image recognition. For example, an AI system can be used to diagnose cancer, by analyzing patient records and medical images for classification and early detection of disease. AI is also used for natural language understanding, by recognizing words and phrases and responding with intelligent advice and providing context for conversations between humans and computers. Autonomous vehicles use AI to navigate the roads, sense and avoid obstacles, and provide a safe, comfortable ride. Finally, AI can be used to recognize images and objects, by analyzing digital images and identifying patterns, colors, and objects.",
