  "input": "",
  "output": "A 3D model of a double helix can be made using computer software such as AutoCAD, Maya, or Blender. The user has the option to create the double helix from scratch, or to choose from pre-made models. To create a double helix from scratch, the user should start by setting the parameters of the object, such as the number of strands, the radius of the helix, and the number of turns. Once these parameters are set, the user should then add the appropriate lines, curves and shapes to create the double helix. Finally, the user should adjust the color and texture of the model according to their preferences.",
