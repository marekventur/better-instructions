  "instruction": "How is the development of renewable energy sources helpful for climate change?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The development of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric power, is a key step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. Renewable energy sources are sustainable, meaning they do not emit carbon dioxide or other pollutants into the atmosphere. Furthermore, they provide an alternative to more traditional energy sources, such as fossil fuels, which are more damaging to the environment. As renewable energy sources continue to be developed and become more accessible, they offer a viable solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and slowing climate change.",
