  "input": "",
  "output": "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a template for creating objects which determine the structure and behavior in a program. A class defines the data and the sequence of operations that are allowed on the data. An object is an instance of a class, which allows the class to have multiple instances that have the same characteristics, but the data may be different. An object can be thought of as a specific example of a class, which can include unique data and methods.",
