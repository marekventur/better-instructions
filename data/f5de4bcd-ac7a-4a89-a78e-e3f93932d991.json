  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce production costs in a manufacturing company is to look for opportunities to streamline the production process. This could include looking at ways to reduce labor costs and using automation to reduce errors. Another strategy is to adopt more efficient manufacturing techniques, such as lean manufacturing, or to purchase better quality raw materials. In addition, companies should look for ways to reduce energy costs, such as using more efficient lightbulbs, or by using renewable energy sources. Finally, companies should consider using inventory and supply chain management systems to better track and manage their inventory and supply chain costs.",
