  "input": "",
  "output": "The British presidency system of India was established in 1773, when the East India Company was granted the right to govern Bengal by the British government. Later laws passed in the late 1700s and early 1800s expanded the power of the East India Company and granted it increased control over the subcontinent. This system eventually became the foundation of British rule in India, leading to the full establishment of the presidency system as a way to centralize and manage British control.",
