  "input": "",
  "output": "The criteria for code readability include: \n- Easily identifiable structure, such as indentation, clear variable and function names, and grouping related elements. \n- Consistent style across the code, including formatting and coding conventions. \n- Avoiding unnecessary complexity and the use of clever approaches. \n- Minimal usage of nesting, so the code does not become too complicated.\n- The code should be self-documenting by using meaningful variable and function names.\n- Proper documentation should be included to explain the purpose of the code and its components. \n- Comments should be included to explain particularly difficult or intricate parts of the code.",
