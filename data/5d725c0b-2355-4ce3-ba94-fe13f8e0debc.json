  "input": "Universal basic income.",
  "output": "Universal basic income is a policy that provides all citizens with a set amount of money regardless of their employment status. This policy can be beneficial by providing a safety net to those who have lost their jobs due to economic downturns, allowing them to stay afloat while they look for new employment opportunities. It can also help reduce poverty and inequality as people in lower-income households have access to a reliable source of income. Furthermore, a universal basic income can help stimulate the economy by providing a source of income to those who can then spend money on goods and services. This can be beneficial to businesses and local economies as money is circulated and invested.",
