  "output": "The wildflower stands out among the grass, \nResilience at its peak, no way to surpass. \nIts gentle petals of vibrant hues \nDisplay its strength, withstanding all abuse. \n\nThrough the frost and heat of summer days \nIt trudges on, refusing to break away. \nIts soft pedals stand tall and spread out wide, \nUndefeated by nature, an ever-lasting guide. \n\nVibrant in color and beauty so fair, \nThe wildflower embodies the power to share. \nIts a symbol of courage and resilience so true, \nWildflower, never giving up, will stay strong through and through.",
