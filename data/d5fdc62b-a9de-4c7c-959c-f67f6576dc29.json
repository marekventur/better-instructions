  "input": "",
  "output": "In April 2021, a new virus was discovered in marine mammals in the North Pacific Ocean, called Akabane virus (AKAV). AKAV is a type of Orthobunyaviridae virus which belong to the family Bunyaviridae and the genus Bunyavirus. AKAV is primarily spread by mosquito bite, and it can cause miscarriage and reproductive failure in pregnant animals, as well as fever and neurologic conditions in humans. This virus is particularly concerning because it can be transmitted between mammals and humans, and there is currently no treatment or anti-viral vaccine developed for it.",
