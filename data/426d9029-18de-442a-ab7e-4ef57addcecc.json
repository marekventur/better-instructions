  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a lonely pumpkin patch in a castle tower. All the other pumpkins in the patch were firmly tucked into the ground, but one of them was a bit odd - it was a prince, cursed to take the form of a pumpkin by an evil spider. He had been a normal prince, until he stumbled upon a strange web while walking through the castle grounds. When he touched the web, the spider appeared and cursed him to take this form forever. The prince was sad, but hopeful - he knew that one day, he would find a way to break the curse.",
