  "output": "Photosynthesis is a process that occurs in plants and other photosynthetic organisms, such as cyanobacteria, where light energy from the sun is absorbed and then converted into chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates, such as glucose. This process is important for producing the oxygen that we need to breathe as well as storing energy for the plant to use. The process takes place in the chloroplasts, which are specialized organelles in the plant. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed and broken down, and the resulting energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and organic compounds such as glucose. Water is also needed for the process and is usually taken up from the roots. The energy stored in the glucose molecules is then used by the plant to grow and create new cells.",
