  "output": "Three types of conversations used by artificial intelligence systems are task-oriented conversations, natural language processing conversations, and knowledge-based conversations. Task-oriented conversations are used to accomplish specific objectives such as flight booking or bank account access. Natural language processing conversations are used to interpret user input and respond accordingly. Knowledge-based conversations are used when AI systems need to access external knowledge sources such as databases.",
