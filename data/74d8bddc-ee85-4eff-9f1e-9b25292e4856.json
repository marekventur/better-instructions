Depending on the model, the piano can vary in size, shape, weight and number of pedals. It is usually played using the two hands on the keyboards or with the help of devices such as the pedal. The piano produces tones by depressing the keys to activate the soundboard and the strings which vibrate to create a unique sound.",
