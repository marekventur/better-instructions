  "input": "",
  "output": "The three key processes in cellular respiration are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose to produce energy. The Krebs cycle produces energy from the molecules produced from glycolysis. Oxidative phosphorylation uses the energy produced in the Krebs cycle to create ATP for the cell to use for energy.",
