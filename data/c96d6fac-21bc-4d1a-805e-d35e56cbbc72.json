One day she ventured deep into the forest and came across a small shack. Inside were two people, an old man and and woman, who were happily living in the shack. They took her in as one of their own and she quickly got used to life in the shack and the surrounding woods. One day, however, she noticed something strange about the old man and woman. It was only then that she realized that they were actually a pair of wolves in disguise!",
