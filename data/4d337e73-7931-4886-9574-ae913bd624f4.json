  "input": "",
  "output": "The main differences between hot-air balloons and helicopters are in speed and maneuverability. Hot-air balloons are much slower and are limited in their maneuverability due to the fact that they cannot change direction or altitude quickly. Helicopters, on the other hand, are much faster and agile, with the ability to hover and change direction quickly. Additionally, helicopters are motorized and rely on fuel while hot-air balloons are powered by heated air.",
