  "output": "Random forests are a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. The algorithm works by first creating a large number of decision trees which it then combines together to create a powerful predictive model. Each decision tree is built from a randomly selected subset of the data, and the trees vote to determine the output of the random forest. Random forests are used for a variety of tasks, such as predicting customer behavior and finding which features are most important in a given data set.",
