  "output": "The process flow of a restaurant typically starts with customers making a reservation or ordering something at the counter. The staff then receives the order and processes it according to the customer\u2019s instructions. Then, the kitchen begins preparing the order, with the food being cooked, prepared and plated. Once the food is ready, servers deliver it to the customer's table. The customer pays for the meal, usually with cash or a credit/debit card. Then, the staff cleans the table and prepares for the next customer. Finally, the restaurant staff goes through order and replenishment procedures to restock ingredients that have been depleted. This cycle continues to serve customers throughout the day.",
