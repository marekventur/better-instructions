  "input": "",
  "output": "The two search engine algorithms that can be compared and contrasted are the inverted index algorithm and the TF-IDF algorithm. The inverted index algorithm stores words from searchable documents in a data structure that enables the algorithms to quickly access documents containing the searched words. The TF-IDF algorithm uses a weighted score to rank search results when multiple words are searched. This scoring system assigns a higher value to words that are more likely to be found in the relevant documents.",
