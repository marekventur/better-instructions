The word is derived from the Latin word \"lexicon\", which means a book containing vocabulary. Lexicalis can also be used to describe a particular language style or register in which the speaker or writer uses a wide array of words and avoids repetitions. It is particularly associated with written or formal language, not spoken language.",
