  "instruction": "Design a difficulty-based punishment for a crime. Output the punishment.",
  "input": "Robbery",
  "output": "An appropriate punishment for robbery would be to require a person to complete community service hours proportional to the difficulty of the crime. For a minor offense, the offender might have to do a few hours of community service. For a more serious crime, the offender could have to do significantly more community service hours, such as up to several hundred. Additionally, the type of community service should be assigned accordingly. For example, an offender who has committed a violent crime may have to complete service hours at a hospital or a rehab center, while a theft-related offense should have service hours related to helping the elderly or homeless.",
