  "output": "The tree stands tall and majestic, reaching up towards the sky with its thick, wide trunk and its full, leafy branches. Its bark is rough and dark, and it is speckled with knots and bumps of various shapes and sizes. The green leaves dance in the slight breeze, rustling loudly and sparkling in the sunlight. Birds chirp from its branches, and it is a haven for small animals and insects. It is a beautiful sight, and one that brings a sense of peace and tranquility to any observer.",
