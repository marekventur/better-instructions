  "input": "",
  "output": "The standard procedure for responding to an oil spill involves cleaning up the oil and mitigating environmental damage. In the immediate response phase, personnel will deploy booms and skimmers to contain the oil, absorb it, and collect it for disposal in a safe location. In addition, personnel may apply dispersants to break up the oil and dilute it, making it easier to cleanup. Other techniques, such as in situ burning or shoreline cleanup, may also be employed. Once the immediate threats have been addressed, personnel will begin the assessment phase, where the impacts from the spill are assessed and documented. This phase will also involve restoring the environment and coastal habitats as much as possible.",
