  "input": "",
  "output": "The Rocky Mountains are a massive mountain range that spans the western US, starting in Montana and extending south to New Mexico. The Rocky Mountains form part of the American Cordillera and are composed of mainly sedimentary and igneous rocks. The highest peak, Mount Elbert in Colorado, reaches a height of 4,401 meters. The range has several other prominent peaks, including Mount Whitney in California and Grays Peak in Colorado. The range has experienced extensive glaciation, resulting in deep U-shaped valleys and jagged peaks. The geology of the range is complex and varied, with large areas of sedimentary rocks such as clays and sandstones.",
