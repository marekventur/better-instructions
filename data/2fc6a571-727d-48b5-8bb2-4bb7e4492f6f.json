  "input": "",
  "output": "Robots are used in manufacturing because they are able to perform tasks with greater accuracy and speed than humans, reducing the chances of human error. They are also able to work continuously, with less or no breaks, which reduces production costs and improves product quality. Robots can also be used to handle hazardous substances and materials, making them an ideal solution for certain tasks that would be dangerous for humans.",
