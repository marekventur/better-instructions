  "input": "",
  "output": "Yes, there have been many changes to who can vote in the US over the years. In 1920, the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote, and in 1971 the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 through the ratification of the 26th Amendment. Native Americans were not granted the right to vote until 1924, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 granted African Americans full suffrage. In recent years, various efforts have been made to expand voting rights to more groups, including felons, non-citizens, and people without a permanent address.",
