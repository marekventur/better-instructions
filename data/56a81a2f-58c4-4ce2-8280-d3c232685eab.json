  "instruction": "Construct a basic machine learning algorithm for the following task.",
  "input": "Identifying cats in images",
  "output": "The algorithm could involve training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on labeled images of cats and other objects. The CNN would learn to distinguish cats from other objects by analyzing features such as color, shape, size, and other image features. Once trained, the CNN would be able to identify cats in images with a specified level of accuracy.",
