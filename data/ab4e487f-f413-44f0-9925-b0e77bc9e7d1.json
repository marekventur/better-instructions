  "instruction": "How would you solve for the roots of x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The roots of the equation x2 - 4x + 4 = 0 can be obtained by solving the quadratic equation by using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is given by x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b2 - 4ac)] / 2a. Substituting b = -4, a = 1, and c = 4 into the equation, the roots are obtained as x = 2 \u00b1 \u221a0. Thus, the roots are x = 2, 2.",
