  "input": "",
  "output": "Friction affects a car's performance by reducing the amount of power available for acceleration. This is because some of the power produced by the engine is lost as heat energy due to the friction between the engine components and their surfaces. The more friction that is present, the more energy is lost and the slower the car will accelerate. As a result, car manufacturers work to reduce friction in various ways, such as by using lubricants, to increase the car\u2019s efficiency. Additionally, friction between the tires and the road affects the amount of traction available, which affects the overall performance of the car.",
