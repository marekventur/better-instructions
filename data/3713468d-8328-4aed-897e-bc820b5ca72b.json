  "output": "It was a cold, dark night and the full moon shone brightly in the sky. I had been walking for hours, but I still hadn't reached my destination. All around me were dark, quiet forests, and my thoughts began to wander. Suddenly, I heard a sound in the distance, the creak of a door, and the shuffle of feet. I stopped and looked around, but there was no one in sight. I took an uneasy step forward and continued on, my heart pounding in my chest.",
