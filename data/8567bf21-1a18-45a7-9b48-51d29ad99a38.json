  "input": "",
  "output": "The environmental impact of using plastic is very negative. Plastic does not biodegrade and is mostly made of non-renewable resources. It can take hundreds of years to break down and can release harmful chemicals into the environment. Plastic also contributes to the massive amount of waste and pollution that is polluting our oceans and negatively impacting the health and well-being of marine life.",
