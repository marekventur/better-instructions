  "input": "",
  "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy from the Sun into chemical energy that they can use to produce food. In this process, plants use carbon dioxide, water and light energy to create sugar and oxygen. Photosynthesis is a key biological process that all plants need to survive, as it is the primary source of energy for them. The sugar and oxygen produced by this process are essential for the growth and development of plants. Additionally, it leads to the release of oxygen into the atmosphere, which is essential for other life forms.",
