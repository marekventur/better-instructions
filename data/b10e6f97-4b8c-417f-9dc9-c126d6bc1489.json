  "output": "To make a grilled cheese sandwich, first butter one side of two slices of bread. Place the slices butter-side down in either a hot non-stick pan or in a buttered pan. Add shredded cheese of your choice over one slice of bread. Top it with the other slice, butter-side up. After a few minutes, use a spatula to lift the sandwich and check if the bottom is golden brown. Flip the sandwich and press it with the spatula so it sticks together. After another few minutes, carefully remove the sandwich from the pan and serve it hot.",
