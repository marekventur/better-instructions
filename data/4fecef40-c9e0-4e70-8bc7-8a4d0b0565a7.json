  "output": "One new technological invention that could improve urban living is solar powered windows. These windows are made with photovoltaic cells that can convert the sun\u2019s light into electricity. This electricity can then be used to power homes and buildings in cities. Solar powered windows can help reduce the energy consumption in urban areas by harnessing clean, renewable energy from the sun. In addition, they are aesthetically pleasing and can provide natural lighting into buildings while reducing the need to turn on electric lights.",
