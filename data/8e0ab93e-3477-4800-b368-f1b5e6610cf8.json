  "output": "John Smith was your average twenty-something man living in the city. He was tall and lanky, but had a certain charm about him which made him stand out from the crowd. He had a sharp mind and an unwavering determination, and he was never afraid to take chances if the opportunity presented itself. He was the type of person who could look at a problem from every angle and come up with a quick solution. Despite his intelligence, he was a kind-hearted soul and believed that anything was possible if you worked hard enough for it.",
