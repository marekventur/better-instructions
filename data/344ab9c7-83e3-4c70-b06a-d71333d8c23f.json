  "input": "",
  "output": "A machine learning algorithm for detecting spam in emails can combine supervised and unsupervised techniques. The supervised techniques can use labeled data to train the algorithm on features that identify spam emails. The unsupervised techniques can use clustering algorithms to identify emails similar to those previously marked as spam. Additionally, existing engines such as Google Safe Browsing and Yahoo\u2019s Slurp can be used as reference to identify similar suspicious emails.",
