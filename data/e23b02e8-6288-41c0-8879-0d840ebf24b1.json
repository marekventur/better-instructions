  "output": "Once upon a time there lived a dragon who was very shy and always felt insecure. He wanted to be able to express himself, so he decided to learn how to dance. He began to practice dancing and soon enough his movements were filled with grace, and he felt confident in his new skill. Everywhere he went people were amazed by his beautiful dancing, and he soon became the star of the village. He was no longer shy and was able to embrace the joys of life.\n\nThe dragon was grateful for the newfound joys of life and showed his appreciation through his beautiful dances. He inspired those around him with his newfound abilities. He travelled the land far and wide, spreading his art until the day he could no longer dance. But before he departed, many still remembered him for the joy he brought with his dancing.",
