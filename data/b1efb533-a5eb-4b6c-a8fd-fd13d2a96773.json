  "input": "Uber",
  "output": "Uber has come under scrutiny for potential security flaws in its app. It has been reported that the app does not have strong measures in place to protect user data, such as user passwords or payment information. Additionally, the app does not have enough transparency for users about potential vulnerabilities in the app, so users are unaware if their information is being shared or sold to third parties. Finally, Uber's reliance on user location data has raised concerns about their potential misuse of user information.",
