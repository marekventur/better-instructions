  "instruction": "Construct a hypothesis to explain why the demand for electric vehicles is increasing.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The hypothesis is that the demand for electric vehicles is increasing due to growing environmental awareness, improved technology, and incentivization from governments. Rising environmental awareness has prompted more people to seek out greener alternatives for transportation. Improved technology for electric vehicles has also made them more attractive and efficient than traditional combustion engines. Finally, various governments have implemented incentives such as tax breaks, subsidies and charging networks to encourage people to switch to electric vehicles.",
