  "output": "Jack and Sam had been the best of friends since their days in school. They did everything together, and were inseparable, until Sam moved away to another city. For years, they were out of touch - until one fateful day when they unexpectedly ran into each other on the street. They were both filled with joy and disbelief, and for a moment it felt like time had reversed and that everything had gone back to the way it used to be. They spent the entire evening chatting and catching up, and by the end of the night, their friendship, was firmly re-established.",
