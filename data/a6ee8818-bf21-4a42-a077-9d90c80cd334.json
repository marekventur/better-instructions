China's GDP per capita has grown by over 800% since 2000, while India's GDP per capita growth has been close to 250%. China has invested heavily in infrastructure, manufacturing, and technological advancements, while India has had slower growth due to poor infrastructure, long bureaucratic processes, and slower economic reforms.",
