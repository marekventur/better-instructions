  "input": "",
  "output": "Using functions can make writing code easier, faster, and more maintainable. By breaking large sections of code into smaller units, the code can be more readable and easier to debug. Functions can also reduce code duplication and promote code reuse. This allows for a more organized code structure and can save time for experienced developers when revisiting existing code.",
