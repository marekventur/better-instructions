  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of a data anonymization technique is k-anonymity. It is a method of generalized data suppression that groups records in a dataset into sets of k records with similar values. This method is used to reduce the amount of identifying information in a dataset by masking, generalizing, or removing specific data elements. K-anonymity helps protect individual privacy by limiting the accuracy of statistical models that may be used to infer the identity of data subjects.",
