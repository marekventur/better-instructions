  "input": "",
  "output": "This algorithm utilizes a stack in order to identify a palindrome. First, the input string is pushed onto a stack. Then, each character is popped from the stack and appended to a new string. Finally, the original string and the reverse string are compared. If the strings are identical, the initial string is a palindrome.",
