  "input": "",
  "output": "Cloud computing is a type of computing that allows users to access technology-based services through the internet. It involves a network of remote servers which are used to store, manage, and process data in a virtual environment. This data is hosted, managed, and updated via the cloud servers and is available from any device connected to the internet. Users can access cloud services on-demand, which allows for rapid scalability and elasticity, meaning users can scale up or down depending on their needs. A single cloud resource can be used by multiple organizations, who can access their own particular resources and data on the same platform. Cloud computing also allows users to leverage applications and storage without the need to purchase and maintain physical hardware.",
