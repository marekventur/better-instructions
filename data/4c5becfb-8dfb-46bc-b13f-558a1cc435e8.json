  "output": "Ribosomes are small organelles found in the cytoplasm of cells which are responsible for protein synthesis. They use mRNA as a template to string together amino acids which form proteins. Ribosomes also bind to tRNA molecules, which carry amino acids to the ribosomes to be incorporated into protein chains. They are also involved in the regulation of gene expression.",
