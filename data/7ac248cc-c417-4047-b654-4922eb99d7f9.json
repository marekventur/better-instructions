  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between an entrepreneur and an intrapreneur is that an entrepreneur is someone who starts their own business, while an intrapreneur is someone who works for an existing company and develops the innovative ideas and projects that contribute to the success of the company. Entrepeneurs have more freedom to take risks and develop their own products and services, whereas intrapreneurs typically have to work within the constraints of the existing organization.",
