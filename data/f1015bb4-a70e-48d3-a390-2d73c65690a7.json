  "output": "A rock garden is an exceptional way to add beauty, character and charm to a landscaping project. It is composed of rocks of various shapes, sizes and textures. The rocks are laid out in a complementary pattern that is inspired by natural arrangements found in nature. The rocks can be strategically placed to create hills, valleys and pathways that provide a unique design element. Plants can be incorporated in between the rocks that can be tailored to the garden based on desired mood or aesthetic. In addition, water features like streams and small ponds can be added to enhance the natural atmosphere. Rock gardens are a great way to bring the beauty of nature to your yard.",
