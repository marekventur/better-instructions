  "instruction": "Identify the ironic device used in this quote",
  "input": "\"Success is the best revenge.\"",
  "output": "This quote makes use of situational irony, which is when the opposite of what is expected or what is intended happens. In this case, the irony lies in the juxtaposition of the ideas of success and revenge. Success is typically seen as a desirable, positive achievement, while revenge is seen as negative and vengeful. Thus, there is a stark contrast between the two concepts, creating an unexpected and ironic outcome.",
