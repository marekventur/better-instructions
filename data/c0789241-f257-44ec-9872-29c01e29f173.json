  "output": "An example of a complex art photo may be an image of a deserted city street during a thunderstorm. The street could be lined with dilapidated buildings and old cars, with rain pouring down the sides of the buildings and puddles forming on the streets. Lightning could be streaking across the sky, illuminating the scene in an eerie but beautiful light. This image could symbolize many different things, such as the fragility of life, or the importance of perspective in our lives.",
