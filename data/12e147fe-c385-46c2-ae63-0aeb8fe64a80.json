  "output": "Decision tree learning is a supervised machine learning technique used to create a predictive model. It is used to map observations about an item onto a predefined set of classes. The decision tree is generated by splitting a dataset into subsets based on the outcome of previous tests. Each subsequent split is based on whether a condition is true or false and each of these sub-splitting will produce a branch in the decision tree. In order to determine the best split, a measure of impurity such as entropy or Gini is used to measure the data at each step. At the final step, when all of the splits have been made and all of the conditions have been evaluated, the final output of a decision tree is a collection of rules that can be used for prediction.",
