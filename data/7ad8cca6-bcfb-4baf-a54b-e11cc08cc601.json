  "output": "Short selling is an investment strategy that involves selling a financial instrument, such as stocks, bonds, or options, that the investor does not currently own, but has borrowed from another investor. The intention is to buy the security back at a lower price, giving the investor a profit. The potential for profit is higher with short selling than with buying and holding, since the investor can make a profit from a decrease in price of the security.",
