  "output": "To make a basic apple crumble, preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Then, prepare the apples: Peel the apples and dice them into small pieces. Once that's done, make the crumble topping by combining the sugar, oats, flour, butter, and cinnamon. Spread the apple pieces in the bottom of a 9x9 baking dish, then sprinkle the crumb topping over the apples. Bake the crumble in the oven until the apples are tender and the topping is golden brown (40-45 minutes). Enjoy!",
