  "input": "",
  "output": "Random forest algorithms are an ensemble learning technique that uses multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to generate more accurate and robust results. It works by creating decision trees from randomly selected subsets of the dataset and then aggregating their results to make a prediction. This technique also provides some useful insights for understanding data and selecting important features for building predictive models.",
