  "input": "",
  "output": "The newest iPhone model is the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which has a 6.5-inch OLED display, a triple camera setup with 12-megapixel cameras and a host of features like faceID, water resistance, and the ability to wirelessly charge other devices. \n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S10 has a slightly larger 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, with a triple camera setup that has 16-megapixel cameras. It also features reverse wireless charging and an in-display fingerprint scanner. Though the iPhone has more features, the Galaxy S10's larger display, larger camera sensor and in-display fingerprint scanner make it a formidable competitor.",
