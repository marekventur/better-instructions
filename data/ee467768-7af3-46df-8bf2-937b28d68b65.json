  "input": "",
  "output": "Empathy and sympathy are both ways of relating to another person\u2019s emotional state. The main difference is that empathy involves understanding and sharing another person\u2019s emotional state, while sympathy is more of an outpouring of compassion or pity. While both have beneficial effects, empathy is a deeper connection and often leads to better problem-solving and conflict resolution.",
