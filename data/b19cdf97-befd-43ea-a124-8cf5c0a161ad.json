  "input": "",
  "output": "One strategy for reducing energy consumption in the home is to invest in energy-efficient appliances, such as LED lights, efficient washing machines, and Energy Star-certified refrigerators. Additionally, unplugging any appliances and devices that are not in use can reduce energy consumption. Other energy-saving measures include installing energy-efficient windows, insulating walls and attics, and weatherizing doors, as well as upgrading heating and cooling systems. Finally, using renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind, is an effective way to reduce energy consumption.",
