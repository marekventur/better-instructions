  "output": "This easy barbeque recipe is the perfect dinner for summer nights! Start by preheating your grill and gathering your ingredients. Begin by seasoning a pound of your favorite cut of chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a hint of cayenne pepper. Place the chicken on the grill and cook it until it's cooked through. While the chicken is cooking, prepare a tangy barbeque sauce by combining ketchup, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce in a saucepan. Simmer the sauce for 10 minutes and brush the chicken with it until it is well-coated. Enjoy your tasty barbeque chicken with a side of potatoes and your favorite summer salad!",
