  "input": "",
  "output": "Classical studies are highly relevant to modern times due to the timeless principles at the heart of the field. It is true that the world has changed significantly since the days of Aristotle and Plato, but the essential human problems they sought to address remain the same. By studying these thinkers and their methods of inquiry, we can gain valuable insight into how to approach complex problems and make informed decisions in our own lives.",
