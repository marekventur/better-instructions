  "input": "",
  "output": "Humans cannot fly because we do not have wings to generate the necessary lift required to overcome the force of gravity. Furthermore, our bodies are not light enough to make up for the lack of wings. Additionally, our muscles are not strong enough to sustain all the effort needed to support a continuous flight.",
