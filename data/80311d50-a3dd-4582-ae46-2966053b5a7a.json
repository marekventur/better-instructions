  "input": "No Input.",
  "output": "The opening scene begins in a small but spacious house nestled in an idyllic suburban neighborhood. It is a typical day in the early morning, a time where all of humanity is in a joyful and peaceful mood. A car pulls up to the house and out of it steps two characters: Jim and Susan. Jim, a tall and lanky figure wearing a colorful Hawaiian shirt, can hardly contain his excitement. Susan, the antithesis of Jim, is a stern and serious looking woman with a no-nonsense attitude. The two of them walk up to the house, Jim\u2019s childlike enthusiasm palpable in his every step. As they approach, they open the creaky door to the house. The sound of a frantic argument greets them; it is a heated family argument full of love and lighthearted joking. Jim and Susan look at each other in utter amusement, both of them knowing that this is going to be a hilarious adventure.",
