  "input": "No input",
  "output": "An AI-based solution to reduce collisions between cars and pedestrians could involve the use of computer vision and machine learning to detect and analyze pedestrian traffic patterns and behaviors. The AI system could then alert drivers of potential risks by providing visual or audio warnings, or even automated braking, accelerating, or steering actions to avoid a collision. Additionally, this AI system could be combined with advanced navigation systems to create routes that avoid high-risk areas for pedestrians.",
