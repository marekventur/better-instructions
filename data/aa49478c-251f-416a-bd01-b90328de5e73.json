  "instruction": "Generate an example of a visualization for comparing two datasets.",
  "input": "Datasets: Sales figures for two different stores over a 6 month period",
  "output": "A visualization for comparing the sales figures of two different stores over a 6 month period could be a line chart. The x-axis would represent the months and the y-axis would represent the sales figures. There would be two separate lines, each showing the sales figures for each store over the 6 month period, and they could be labeled with the store names. This would make it easy to compare the sales performance of the two different stores.",
