  "output": "A good strategy to increase customer engagement is to offer incentives for customers to return. This can be done by providing rewards for repeat purchases, offering discounts for referring friends, or creating loyalty programs with exclusive benefits. Additionally, engaging customers through social media and personalizing the customer experience can help boost engagement.\n##\n19. Instruction: Compare and contrast decision trees and random forests\n\n19. Input: \n<noinput>\n\n19. Output: \nDecision trees and random forests are both supervised learning algorithms that are used in a variety of tasks, such as regression and classification. The main difference lies in how they make predictions. Decision trees use a series of if-then statements to determine how to classify a sample data point, while random forests use an ensemble of decision trees. The result of using random forests is generally a more accurate model than what is produced by a decision tree. Random forests also require less tuning than decision trees since they don't require the same level of combination-selection process used for decision trees.",
