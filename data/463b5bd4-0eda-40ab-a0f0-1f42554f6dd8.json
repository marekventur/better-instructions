  "input": "",
  "output": "Afforestation is the process of planting trees in areas where there were no trees before. This helps the environment by increasing the number of trees and plants, which provide oxygen and sequestrate carbon dioxide, thus improving air quality. Additionally, trees help conserve water, increase biodiversity, and create habitat for wildlife. Through these activities, forestry helps reduce the risks associated with degraded land and climate change, making it an essential part of environmental well-being.",
