  "instruction": "Explain what a \"root cause analysis\" is.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A root cause analysis is a process of identifying the underlying cause of a problem by investigating and examining the symptoms, patterns and trends associated with it. It involves analyzing the problem and its conditions to determine the primary cause of the issue, rather than simply addressing the symptoms. By understanding the root cause, businesses can address the underlying cause of the problem and reduce the likelihood of it happening again. Root cause analysis often involves breaking down the system into its components and examining the interactions between them, to identify the cause of the issue. This data-driven approach allows organizations to quickly identify, address, and correct the root causes of the problem.",
