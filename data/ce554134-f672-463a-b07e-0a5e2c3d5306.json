  "input": "Scenario: A thief has locked the protagonist in a room and taken the key away.",
  "output": "The protagonist should try to look for a way out of the room. They could try to pry open the window if there is one, or look for loose floorboard that leads to a crawl space or basement. Another option is to try to find a makeshift weapon to overpower the thief and take back the key. They could also look for something in the room - like a wire hanger - that they could use to pick the lock.",
