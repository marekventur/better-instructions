  "output": "The American Revolution was a period of conflict between the British colonial powers and the emerging United States of America. It began with the Stamp Act of 1765, which levied taxes on the colonists, and increased calls for independence from Britain. These calls were galvanized by the Declaration of Independence on July 4th, 1776. The Revolutionary War, between the colonies and Britain, began that same year and lasted until 1783 when the Treaty of Paris was signed, formally recognizing the independence of the United States. The Revolution had a profound impact on the nation\u2019s political, social, and economic foundations, and saw the creation of many of the symbols and traditions that define the United States today.",
