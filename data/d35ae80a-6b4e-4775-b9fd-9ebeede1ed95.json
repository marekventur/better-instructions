  "input": "",
  "output": "A reflex arc is a neural pathway that is responsible for carrying out a reflex action. It consists of a sensory neuron which receives a stimulus, a motor neuron which carries the signal from the sensory neuron to the effector, and the effector which responds to the signal. For example, when one touches a hot object, the sense of touch is registered by the sensory neuron, which then sends an impulse to the motor neuron. The motor neuron then relays the impulse to the effector, which is usually a muscle, causing it to contract and thus helping one to take away their hand from the hot object. The entire process occurs in a matter of milliseconds and does not involve the higher centres of the brain.",
