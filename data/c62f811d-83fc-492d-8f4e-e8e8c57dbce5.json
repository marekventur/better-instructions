  "input": "",
  "output": "Absolute advantage is a concept in economics that refers to the ability of an individual, company, or country to produce goods or services more efficiently than its competitors. It determines which country has the greatest ability to produce goods and services, in comparison to others. Countries that have absolute advantage are able to produce more goods or services for the same amount of resources than other countries. For example, if a country can produce 10 widgets with 20 hours of labor, while another country can only produce 8 widgets with 20 hours of labor, the first country would have an absolute advantage in widget production. This concept of absolute advantage helps countries and companies identify their competitive advantages and understand how best to use their resources in order to stay competitive.",
