  "output": "Climate change is having a profound effect on the environment and all life on Earth. It is causing higher temperatures across the globe, extreme weather changes such as flooding and drought, and an increase in sea levels. In addition to these physical effects, climate change also has an emotional impact. It causes anxiety and stress, due to the worry of the unknown and the potential destruction it could cause. Finally, it is disproportionately affecting low-income households, which don't have the resources to access clean energy and adapt to the changing environment.",
