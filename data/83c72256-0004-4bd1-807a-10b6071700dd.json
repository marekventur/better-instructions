  "output": "A sales strategy is a long-term plan for achieving revenue objectives by making sales. It typically contains elements such as sales goals, key objectives, tactics, target customer base, message, budget, and scope. Sales goals are the targets that the company sets in terms of sales performance and revenue. Key objectives provide the strategies and action plans to achieve the goals, while tactics are specific plans of action that outline how to execute the strategies. The target customer base refers to the group the strategy is targeting, and the message is the sales pitch that outlines how the company\u2019s products or services will help solve the customer\u2019s problems. The budget is the amount of money allocated to the strategy, and scope is the range of activities that must be implemented to make the sales strategy successful.",
