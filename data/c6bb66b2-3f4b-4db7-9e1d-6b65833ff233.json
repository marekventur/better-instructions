  "input": "",
  "output": "The Baetsar\u2013Frank conjecture was an important breakthrough in graph theory and discrete mathematics. It states that the genus of a graph is bounded by its number of edges. This conjecture led to new ways of thinking about graph theory, providing insight into the structure and properties of graphs. It also provided a new way to analyze algorithms on graphs, as well as providing a better understanding of the complexity of certain graph problems.",
