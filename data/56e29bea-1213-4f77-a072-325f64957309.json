  "input": "",
  "output": "A computational design for moving a robotic arm only requires minimal code, such as specifying the direction, speed, and force of the movements. Additionally, a set of predefined positions and sequences can be programmed as part of the design, which can help the arm move with more accuracy and precision.",
