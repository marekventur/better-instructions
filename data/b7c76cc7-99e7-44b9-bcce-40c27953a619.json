  "input": "",
  "output": "Solar eclipses occur when the moon passes between the Sun and Earth, casting a shadow on Earth's surface. This happens because the orbital path of the Moon crosses the path of the Sun as seen from Earth, and the Moon casts a shadow on the Earth's surface. This is the same phenomenon that causes lunar eclipses, when the Moon passes through Earth's shadow.",
