  "output": "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Also known as the \"Red Planet,\" it has long been associated with war and has inspired many science fiction stories. Mars is the only planet besides Earth to have evidence of liquid water on its surface in the form of ice and running water. It has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which were discovered in 1877. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of CO2, nitrogen and argon, and its climate ranges from cold polar regions to hot equatorial regions. It also has the largest dust storms in the Solar System, which can last for weeks. Because of its similarity to our own planet, Mars is a target of exploration and colonization efforts.",
