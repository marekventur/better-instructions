  "input": "",
  "output": "Multitasking can be harmful because it leads to divided attention, which can reduce productivity, increase stress levels, and cause mistakes or incomplete tasks. When people focus on multiple tasks at the same time, they are unable to use their full concentration on any one task. This can lead to reduced quality and accuracy, as well as longer completion times. Furthermore, multitasking can make it difficult to switch between tasks, creating unnecessary stress and confusion.",
