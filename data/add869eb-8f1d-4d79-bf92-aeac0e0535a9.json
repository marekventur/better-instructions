  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a small child who dreamed of flying. Every day they watched the birds soaring through the sky and wished they could join them. \nOne day, they decided to try. The child gathered their courage and ran and jumped, flapping their arms and wishing with all their might. But the ground just kept pulling them down, no matter how hard they wished. \nFinally, the child stopped and looked up. A lark was soaring above, watching them curiously. It swooped down and landed in front of them, and the child wondered if it could teach them how to fly. The lark encouraged the child to keep trying and flapping their arms, and soon the child was lifting off the ground. \nThe lark flew beside the child, guiding them as they flew around the village and out into the open sky. The child felt free and exhilarated, filled with the wonder of flight. They flew together until the sun set, and the child returned home feeling happy and fulfilled.",
