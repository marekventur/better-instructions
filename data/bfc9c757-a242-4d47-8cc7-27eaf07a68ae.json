  "instruction": "What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy in Python?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A shallow copy in Python is a bit-wise copy of an object. It creates a new object which stores the reference of the existing object. It does not create a copy of nested objects, instead it just copies the reference of nested objects. A deep copy creates a copy of object as well as of nested objects. In deep copy, a copy of object is copied in other object. It means that any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the original object.  In deep copy, a copy of object is copied in other object. It means that any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the original object.",
