  "input": "",
  "output": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two particles can be entangled, or connected, so that the conditions of each particle are related even at a large distance. This means that each particle is instantaneously aware of what changes have been made to the other particle, even though they may be separated by vast distances. This happens without the transfer of information, and it is thought to be an aspect of quantum mechanics that is still not fully understood. In addition to describing two particles in a state of entanglement, the concept can be extended to apply to larger numbers of particles and even collections of particles. As such, quantum entanglement has become an important tool for researchers studying a variety of quantum phenomena.",
