  "output": "One of the most effective ways to reduce environmental pollution is to reduce emissions from vehicles. This can be done by carpooling, using public transportation, or using electric or hybrid vehicles. Other ways to reduce emissions include investing in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power or increasing the use of energy-efficient appliances. Additionally, reducing the amount of waste produced can also help reduce environmental pollution. Everyone can help by composting, reusing and recycling items, and cutting down on plastic and single-use items.",
