  "output": "Taiwan is an island nation in East Asia located off the southeastern coast of mainland China and directly west of Japan and the East China sea. Taiwan is self-governed and has its own government, currency, and policies, although it is not currently recognized as an independent nation by the international community. The island is divided into two regions \u2014 the Free area of Taiwan which makes up the main island, and the Penghu Islands which are to the west. The main island of Taiwan is geographically diverse, featuring mountains and hills, basins and plains, and several rivers and lakes. Politically, Taiwan is governed as a unitary semi-presidential representative democracy with a parliamentary system. Relations between Taiwan and mainland China remain strained, with Beijing continuing to recognize Taiwan as part of its territory.",
