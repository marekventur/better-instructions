  "instruction": "Explain why the given phenomenon happens.",
  "input": "Tides",
  "output": "Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on the Earth\u2019s oceans. The Moon\u2019s gravitational pull is much stronger than the Sun's because it is much closer to the Earth. This causes the oceans to bulge in the direction of the Moon, and the oceans bulge away from the Moon in the opposite direction. As the Earth moves around the Moon, the bulge of water moves around the Earth with it, creating high and low tides as the water meets different landforms on the coast.",
