  "input": "",
  "output": "An effective backup plan for a company's data in case of emergency should involve both physical and digital backups. For physical backups, the company should store copies of important files and documents on reliable external hard drives and CDs. For digital backups, the company can use cloud-based services such as Dropbox or Google Drive to store their data in a secure, remote location. In addition, the company should frequently test their backups systems to make sure the data can be easily retrieved in an emergency.",
