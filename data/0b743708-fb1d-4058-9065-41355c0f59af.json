  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Inspect the data set for potential sources of error.\n2. Ensure that the data and model are compatible with each other and are pre-processed in the same way.\n3. Test each component of the AI system independently.\n4. Consider different metrics and data visualizations to better understand the results.\n5. Utilize techniques such as bagging or cross-validation to find the source of error.\n6. Leverage transfer learning to compare the performance of an AI algorithm to a baseline.\n7. Compare the performance of the AI algorithm against different datasets.\n8. Use an evolutionary process to quickly try out different combinations to determine the best performing setup.",
