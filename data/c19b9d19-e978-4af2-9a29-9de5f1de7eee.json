  "instruction": "Write a persuasive argument for blocking the use of facial recognition in public spaces.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Most people feel that facial recognition should not be used in public spaces, as it invades their privacy and takes away their right to be anonymous. Facial recognition makes it easier to be tracked, monitored and identified quickly, which puts citizens at risk of being unfairly targeted or wrongly accused. Moreover, the technology is often biased, leading to misidentification of people and racial profiling. Additionally, it can be abused by organizations or governments for unethical purposes, leading to potential manipulation and control of people. Therefore, blocking the use of facial recognition in public spaces is necessary to ensure our fundamental rights are respected.",
