  "input": "",
  "output": "Implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) involves several steps. First, the data is pre-processed, which includes normalizing and reshaping it into the right format. Next, the network architecture is constructed, which includes selecting the right layers, defining the number of filters and the size of the convolutional window. Following that, the weights of the model are optimized by backpropagation within the training process. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to make accurate predictions. Finally, the model can be tested to ensure that the accuracy is satisfactory.",
