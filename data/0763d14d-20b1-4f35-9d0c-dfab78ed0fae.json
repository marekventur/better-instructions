  "instruction": "Explain the difference between a firewall and antivirus software.",
  "input": "<none>",
  "output": "A firewall is a system that inspects incoming and outgoing network traffic to decide whether to allow it or block it based on a set of predefined rules. It is mainly used to protect a computer or a network from external threats like malware, hackers, viruses, and worms. An antivirus software, on the other hand, is used to detect, block, and remove virus, worms, and other malicious code on a computer or network. An antivirus program is also meant to detect and remove malicious programs that have already been downloaded onto the computer. The firewall focuses on preventing malicious code from entering the system, while the antivirus focuses on finding malicious code that is already in the system, and removing it.",
