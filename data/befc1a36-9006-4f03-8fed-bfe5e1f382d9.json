  "output": "Once there was a young girl whose parents were always busy. Though she was surrounded by people, she often found herself feeling alone.\n\nOne day as she was out exploring in the woods, she encountered a magical creature \u2013 a dragon. The dragon was scared and hid in the shadows at first, but the girl spoke to it in a gentle voice, trying to reassure it.\n\nThey spent hours talking, from the moment the sun rose to when it disappeared beyond the horizon. They talked about their hopes, their dreams, their fears and their desires. The dragon showed her its magical powers, and the girl taught it about the world.\n\nThe girl had never felt so connected to anyone before, and soon they became best friends. The time they spent together was filled with laughter, stories and adventures, and before long the girl was truly happy.\n\nThe young girl and the dragon had created a bond that could never be broken. They were two souls who had grown close in a short time, and even if they were ever parted, they would never forget the other.\n\nThis is the story of a young girl who found joy and friendship in the most unexpected places. It's a reminder to never close your heart to new possibilities... because sometimes wonderful things come in unexpected packages.",
