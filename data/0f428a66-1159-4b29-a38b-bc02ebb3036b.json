  "instruction": "Design an app that allows users to build their own robots.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The app design would provide a comprehensive toolset for users to build their own robots. It would offer different step-by-step instructions and tutorials on how to build a robot from scratch, as well as different robot kits for users who want a pre-made solution. It would include a library of robot parts and components, where users could find pre-made parts or create their own unique parts, which could be ordered from the app. There would also be helpful troubleshooting and support tools, as well as educational resources to help users learn more about robotics. Lastly, the app would provide a forum for users to discuss their projects and share ideas.",
