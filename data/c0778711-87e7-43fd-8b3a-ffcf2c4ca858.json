  "output": "Algorithm:\n1. Initialize the distances of all nodes from the source node.  \n2. Pick the node among the unvisited nodes with the least distance from the source node. \n3. Calculate the distance of each unvisited node from this picked node. \n4. Go to step 2 if there are still nodes left unvisited. \n5. Once all the nodes are visited, the algorithm is complete.",
