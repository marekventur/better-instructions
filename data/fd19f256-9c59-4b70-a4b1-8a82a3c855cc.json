  "instruction": "Describe the communication between two neurons.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Communication between two neurons occurs when an electrical impulse, or action potential, is generated in the sending neuron and transmitted along the axon. The action potential travels to the synapse of the receiving neuron, which releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters bind to receptors in the post synaptic membrane, and the signal is sent along the dendrites of the receiving neuron and an electrical signal is generated. This continues along the dendrites until an action potential is generated and the signal is sent to the cell body, which processes the information.",
