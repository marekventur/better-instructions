  "output": "The goal of deep learning is to create powerful artificial neural networks, modeled after the networks found in the brain, to process complex data inputs and make accurate predictions. Deep learning enables machines to find patterns in data and make decisions based on that data. It can be used in a variety of tasks from image recognition, to natural language processing, to self-driving cars.",
