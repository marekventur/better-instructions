  "output": "Alice was a young woman living in a world where the laws of physics no longer applied. To her surprise, she found that she could fly if she just closed her eyes and imagined it. She soon came to terms with their new reality and soon enough began to take advantage of it. One day, she flew at top speeds over mountains, cities and oceans and witnessed some of the most incredible sights of her life. She went on many adventures and discovered so many things about the world around her. She was thankful for the new world she lived in and used her abilities to explore and help others. The laws of physics no longer applied, but Alice found a way to use it to her advantage.",
