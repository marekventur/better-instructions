  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary difference between e-commerce and conventional businesses is the way they conduct their business operations. E-commerce businesses transact digitally and use electronic technologies to facilitate various transactions including customer acquisition, product sales, and payments, whereas traditional businesses rely on physical infrastructure and face-to-face customer engagement. E-commerce businesses can have a global reach and offer products or services across multiple geographic locations, whereas conventional businesses are limited geographically to their operating locations. E-commerce businesses typically have lower overhead costs and are able to offer lower prices for their products than conventional businesses.",
