  "output": "Neurons are the nerve cells in the brain and body that transmit information. They specialize in receiving, processing, and sending signals to other cells in the body. The neurons interact and communicate with one another through electrochemical processes. The electrical signals travel from the neuron\u2019s dendrites to the cell body, and then move along the axon to the terminals, where it is sent to other neurons for further processing. This chain of communication is the basis for how neurons process information and create memories.",
