  "input": "DNA Replication",
  "output": "DNA replication is the process when a cell duplicates its genetic material in preparation for cell division. It is a semi-conservative process, meaning that each strand of the original DNA molecule serves as a template for the creation of its partner strand. During the process, DNA polymerase binds to each of the two parental DNA strands and synthesizes a complementary daughter strand. The daughter strands separate from the parental strands and form two new molecules, completing the process of replication.",
