  "input": "The app features a simple layout in which the user can click through different sections of the app to view requests and comments",
  "output": "The design of this app looks quite straightforward, however there is room for improvement. The current layout may not be fully user friendly and easily navigable, as users need to click through sections in order to view requests and comments. It may be beneficial to incorporate a navigation bar at the top of the page to make it easier for users to navigate the app. Furthermore, possible deeper levels of content could be included by incorporating dropdown menus to minimize scrolling.",
