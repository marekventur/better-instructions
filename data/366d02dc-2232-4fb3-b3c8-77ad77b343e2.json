  "output": "I would design a mini game where the player plays as a gardener and has five minutes to create the most impressive flower garden. The player will collect various kinds of flowers, each with their own unique characteristics, to assemble a beautiful and vibrant garden. The flowers may need to be watered and fertilized in order to grow and reach their full potential. The player will also need to place various kinds of garden accessories like benches, bird baths, and trellises to attract more birds and butterflies. The game is scored based on the beauty and uniqueness of the player's garden.",
