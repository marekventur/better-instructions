  "output": "The myth of Osiris is an ancient Egyptian myth dating back to at least 2000 BC. According to the myth, Osiris was the king of Egypt, but his brother Seth became jealous and plotted against him. Seth killed Osiris, cut his body into 14 pieces, and scattered them across Egypt. Osiris's wife Isis was so grief stricken that she searched for each of the pieces and reassembled them, making Osiris \"whole\" again. Osiris' death was reinterpreted as a symbol of fertility and rebirth. As a result, Osiris was worshipped as a god of the dead and the afterlife.",
