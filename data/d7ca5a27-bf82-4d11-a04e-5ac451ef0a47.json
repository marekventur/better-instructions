  "instruction": "Explain why the additive identity property holds in mathematics.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The additive identity property states that adding zero to any number will not alter its value. This holds in mathematics because adding zero to a number does not change its value; when you add zero to 5, for example, the result is the same as the original number (5). This principle is known as the additive identity law and it is found in many mathematical equations and performs important functions in mathematics.",
