  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a variable rate loan and a fixed rate loan is that a variable rate loan has an interest rate that can change over time, while a fixed rate loan has an interest rate that remains the same throughout the loan\u2019s term. Variable rate loans tend to be more competitive, but they can be riskier, as the borrower may end up paying more if interest rates rise during the loan term. Fixed rate loans, on the other hand, provide more peace of mind, as they offer the borrower a predictable monthly payment.",
