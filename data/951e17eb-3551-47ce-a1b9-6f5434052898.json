  "input": "",
  "output": "An asynchronous process is a type of process in computer programming that does not require a certain sequence of events in order to complete. This means that one task can start and finish without waiting for another task to be completed. An asynchronous process is a non-blocking task and is often used to improve the speed of operations. For example, an asynchronous process could be used to send out a series of emails while other tasks are running in parallel.",
