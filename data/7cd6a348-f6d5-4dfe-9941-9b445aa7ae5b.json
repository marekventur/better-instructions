  "input": "",
  "output": "Keras is an open-source software library designed for deep learning, which is the process of training computers to make decisions based on data. It was built with a focus on being user-friendly and accessible to developers around the world, and it is written in Python. Keras allows developers to quickly and easily design, train and evaluate neural network models, which can be used to solve complex problems. Keras also provides efficient tools for computing gradients with respect to parameters, while also providing a variety of modules to build and train neural networks. It has a wide range of hyperparameters, which allows developers to fine-tune and optimize their models. The main purpose of Keras is to enable developers to create powerful and sophisticated deep learning models with relative ease and speed.",
