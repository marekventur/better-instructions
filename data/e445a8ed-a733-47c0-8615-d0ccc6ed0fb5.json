  "input": "",
  "output": "A possible algorithm to solve the problem is as follows: \n1. Initialize a result variable (res) to -1.\n2. Iterate over the given matrix.\n3. For each element, check if it is greater than 0.\n4. If so, store it in a set s.\n5. For each element in the matrix, iterate from 1 to N and if the element is not present in the set, update the result variable (res) with the value and break from the loop.\n6. Finally, return res.",
