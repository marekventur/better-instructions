  "input": "",
  "output": "The timeline of the history of computer vision starts with the first commercial use of computer vision in 1971, where images were analyzed in order to identify similarities between the images. This was followed by the development of the first computer vision workstations in 1972 and the pioneering works in object recognition and tracking in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the late 1980s, early neural networks were used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object recognition and tracking, and 3D object recognition. In the 1990s, advancements in computer vision led to the development of more powerful and sophisticated methods such as convolutional neural networks, feature-based image registration, and content-based image retrieval. In the 2000s, the focus shifted to further advancing deep learning and neural networks for Computer Vision tasks. Today, computer vision is used in a variety of applications, such as autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, medical imaging, and more.",
