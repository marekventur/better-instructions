  "instruction": "Design a home security system with the necessary components.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A home security system should have several components in order to be effective. Firstly, it should include door or window sensors, which detect if a door or window has been opened and trigger an alarm if necessary. Additionally, it should have motion sensors, which detect movement in certain areas of the home. It should also include surveillance cameras, for monitoring any suspicious activity. \n\nIn addition, a home security system should include a control panel, which allows the system to be activated and deactivated. It should also include a security keypad, which is used to program alarm codes. Finally, a home security system should have sirens, which sound when an intrusion is detected.",
