  "input": "",
  "output": "A plan to reduce food waste would include multiple strategies. Firstly, implementing more efficient inventory tracking systems in order to reduce overstocking and reduce the amount of food that goes to waste. Secondly, rethinking packaging size and making the right portion size available to the customers. Thirdly, promoting the donations of excess food to those in need. Lastly, encouraging proper food storage to minimize spoilage. With the implementation of these strategies, we can make sure that food is not wasted but shared with those who need it.",
