  "output": "Global warming is the term used to describe the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans due to human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases. It has far-reaching effects on the environment, such as sea level rise, an increase in global temperatures, an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather, acidification of the oceans, degradation of marine biodiversity, and more. In addition to these effects, global warming can also have serious implications for human health and security, such as water scarcity and increased risk of diseases, infestations, and wildfires.",
