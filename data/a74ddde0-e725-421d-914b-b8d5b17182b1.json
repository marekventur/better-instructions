  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm for converting an integer to a string should begin by allocating memory for the resulting string. Then, a loop should be used to iterate through the digits of the integer. During each iteration, the corresponding digit should be stored in the string. Once the loop is finished, the algorithm should return the string.",
