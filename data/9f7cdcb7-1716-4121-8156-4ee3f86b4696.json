  "input": "noinput",
  "output": "The OSI Model consists of seven different layers, each responsible for a different part of the data transmission process. The layers are organized in a hierarchy, with each layer having a specific purpose and each proposing protocols to fulfill that purpose. \nThe first layer is the physical layer, which deals with the transmission of raw data between devices.\nThe second layer, the Data Link layer, is responsible for providing error-free transmission and physical addressing of the data.\nThe third layer is the Network layer, which is responsible for the routing of data packets between different networks.\nThe fourth layer is the Transport layer, which provides the necessary data flow control.\nThe fifth layer is the Session layer, which deals with the establishment, maintenance and synchronization of connections.\nThe sixth layer is the Presentation layer, which deals with encoding and formatting of data.\nThe seventh layer is the Application layer, which is the layer that provides user access to network services.",
