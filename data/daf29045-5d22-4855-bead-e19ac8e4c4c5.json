  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a brave frog who lived in a pond in the woods. One day, a great forest fire broke out, threatening all the animals in the area. The frog was determined to help, so she hopped out of the pond and across the woods, gathering fallen leaves in her mouth. She stacked up the leaves around her pond and created a barrier to prevent the fire from spreading. With everyone safe, the frog had saved the day!",
