  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a small green frog who lived near a pond. He was a very lonely frog, as he had no one to talk to and was not very good at talking either. One day, he decided to take a chance and try to make some friends. He hopped around the pond, meeting many different frogs who were open to having a conversation with him. Eventually, he found a group of frogs with whom he could have fun, and they all became best friends until the end of time.",
