  "instruction": "Provide a solution to reduce emissions from transportation.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce emissions from transportation is to shift toward more efficient vehicles, like electric or hybrid cars, buses and trucks. Governments can also provide incentives for citizens to buy more efficient vehicles and implement regulations to limit emissions, or even ban gas-powered cars altogether. Cities should also provide public transportation options, like buses, trains, and bike lanes, to enable citizens to reduce their reliance on cars.",
