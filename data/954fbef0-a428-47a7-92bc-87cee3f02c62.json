  "input": "",
  "output": "AI could be used to solve global climate change by analyzing large amounts of data to identify patterns and predict the effects of human-induced climate change. AI could also be used to develop new technologies to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency. AI could even be used to develop systems and policies that enable countries and organizations to better respond to and prepare for climate events.",
