  "input": "",
  "output": "Perfect competition is a market structure where there are many small buyers and sellers, all of whom have perfect knowledge and no influence on the price of the product. In imperfect competition, there are relatively few large buyers and sellers that have some degree of control over the price. Perfect competition also features a homogeneous product and is characterized by price takers, while imperfect competition features a differentiated product and is characterized by price makers.",
