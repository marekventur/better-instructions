  "output": "Once upon a time there was a troll who lived under a bridge with all of his belongings. He was very lonely, as no other creature in the nearby area dared to come close. One day he encountered a family of four and offered them to use his bridge as a passage for their travels. The family accepted with delight and the troll became their guardian, fixing any broken parts, clearing away the leaves, branches, and other obstacles. The troll was so happy that he had made a real friend. They exchanged stories and occasionally gifts \u2014 the family had given the troll a new coat and a hat in return for his favors. From then on, they shared a special bond and the troll was no longer lonely.",
