  "instruction": "Create a program to categorize animals into different groups.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The program would take in different animals as input and then classify them according to the following categories: mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, insects, and arachnids. Then it would assign each animal to the correct category and output it to the user. The program should be able to identify different animals easily and provide feedback to the user if they input an animal it doesn't recognize. The program should also be able to adjust to additional groups and animals as they get introduced. Additionally, the program should be able to account for more complex instances like hybrids, subspecies, and endemics. In addition, the program should be able to ascertain the scientific name of the animal in case the user inputs its various common names. Lastly, the program should provide a list of other animals in the same category for comparison purposes.",
