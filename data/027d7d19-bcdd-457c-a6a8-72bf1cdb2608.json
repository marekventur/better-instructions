  "input": "Cell division",
  "output": "A scientist would explain that cell division is the process by which cells divide into two or more daughter cells. During this process, the genetic material of the parent cell is replicated, one copy of the double helix going to each daughter cell. The daughter cells then divide into their own new cells, forming a new generation of cells.",
