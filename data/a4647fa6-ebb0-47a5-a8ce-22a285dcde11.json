  "input": "",
  "output": "This error means that you are trying to join a string (str) and an integer (int) which is not allowed. The code is likely trying to concatenate string and a number, or a string and a variable that holds a number, as strings and numbers have different data types and cannot be joined together. To resolve the error, try converting the number to a string first.",
