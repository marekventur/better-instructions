  "instruction": "Name five different varieties of tea.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Five different varieties of tea are green tea, black tea, oolong tea, herbal tea, and white tea. Green tea is derived from the Camellia sinensis plant and has many health benefits. Black tea is also derived from the Camellia sinensis plant, and is processed in a different way. Oolong tea, which is made from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, is semi-oxidized and typically has a stronger flavor and aroma than green or black tea. Herbal tea is produced from herbs, fruits, spices, and flowers and does not contain leaves from the Camellia sinensis plant. Finally, white tea is made from young and minimally-processed leaves from the Camellia sinensis plant and has a milder flavor than the other types of tea.",
