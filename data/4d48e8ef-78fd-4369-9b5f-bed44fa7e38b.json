  "output": "The key differences between artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks are as follows:\n\n- Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are composed of layers of neurons that are interconnected and process input data to form an output. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are composed of multiple layers of neurons that are interconnected, but they are organized in a manner that preserves the spatial relationship between the input and the output.\n\n- ANNs can process numerical data and vector representations of inputs. CNNs are specialized for image recognition and can process image-related data such as pixels in an image.\n\n- ANNs use back-propagation and gradient descent to optimize the weights in the network. CNNs use a technique called \u201cconvolution\u201d, where pixels are moved through the network to detect features in the data.\n\n- ANNs are more general in nature and can be used for a variety of tasks. CNNs are more specialized, and are typically used for tasks like image recognition, object detection, generation of images, and natural language processing.",
