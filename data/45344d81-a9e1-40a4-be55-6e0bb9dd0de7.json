  "input": "",
  "output": "The concept of \"locus of control\" refers to the degree to which people believe that they have control over their own lives. People with an internal locus of control believe that their outcomes are a result of their own actions, whereas those with an external locus of control believe that their outcomes are a product of external forces that are outside of their control. Those with an internal locus of control tend to take an active role in their lives, while those with an external locus of control may become passive or leave decisions to others.",
