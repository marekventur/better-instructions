  "output": "The title of the story is: \"The Not-So Sushi-Loving Hedgehog\".\n\nThe story begins when a small hedgehog enters a restaurant specializing in sushi. The Hedgehog is hungry and looking for a delicious meal. He walks along the neat rows of sushi, filled with all sorts of colorful delights. His eyes sparkle with joy and anticipation.\n\nBut then he spots something he wasn't expecting. Piles of raw vegetables and mushrooms, just as with sushi, but without fish. The Hedgehog is absolutely perplexed and starts to sniff the air. He doesn't understand what he's looking at, but he knows one thing for certain: he's not getting his beloved fish tonight! \n\nSo, the Hedgehog decides to walk away. He looks up and sees a sign reading, \"Vegan Sushi only\". \n\nThe Hedgehog has learned his lesson and decides to search elsewhere for his fishy dinner. From then on, he makes sure to check the signs before entering the restaurant. \n\nMoral of the story: Carefully read all signs before entering a sushi restaurant. You never know what you might find!",
