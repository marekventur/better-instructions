  "output": "Designing an effective survey involves several steps. First, decide on the purpose and objectives of the survey. This will determine the type of questions (open-ended, multiple-choice, etc.) and the topics that should be covered. Next, create the questions based on the purpose and objectives. Be sure to ask clear, unbiased questions and avoid leading questions that only yield one type of response. After the questions have been created, decide the best way to collect the survey responses such as online, in-person, phone, or another method. Once the survey has been designed and distributed, review the data and analyze the responses. Finally, present the results to the relevant stakeholders.",
