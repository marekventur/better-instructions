  "input": "",
  "output": "Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon in which the gravitational field of a massive object distorts the path that light takes when traveling through space. This causes the light to be deflected around the object, producing a magnified, or brighter, image of a more distant object. Gravitational lensing can also have the opposite effect, causing an image of a distant object to appear distorted or split into multiple images, depending on the shape and alignment of the objects involved.",
