  "input": "",
  "output": "A setting in which you could apply chaos theory would be in a complex economic system. By examining the inconsistencies and unpredictability of the economy and the factors that contribute to it, chaos theory can be used to understand how small changes can cause large and unexpected changes. By using chaos theory, you could gain a better understanding of how different economic and market actors interact with each other and why certain trends emerge and others diminish.",
