  "output": "Verse 1:\nI was lost in a spell, nowhere to be found\nThe darkness crept in, it would not turn around\nWanting to run, but my legs wouldn't move\nIt felt like a dark night of the soul\n\nChorus:\nLost in a place, no one had been before\nMy heart was aching, there was no one at the door\nCold and alone, feeling so small\nIt was a dark night of the soul\n\nVerse 2:\nPulling me down and telling me lies\nThe shadows of doubt filled me with cries\nSearching for hope, but feeling so low\nIt was a dark night of the soul\n\nChorus:\nLost in a place, no one had been before\nMy heart was aching, there was no one at the door\nCold and alone, feeling so small\nIt was a dark night of the soul\n\nBridge:\nI could hear the echoes of the past\nVoices ringing in the air\nRemembering all the struggles I've faced\nSlipping away into despair\n\nChorus:\nLost in a place, no one had been before\nMy heart was aching, there was no one at the door\nCold and alone, feeling so small\nIt was a dark night of the soul",
