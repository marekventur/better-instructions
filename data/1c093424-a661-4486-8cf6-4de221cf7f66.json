  "input": "",
  "output": "Machine learning can be used to predict traffic patterns and anticipate areas of congestion. AI-driven solutions can analyze traffic data in real-time, providing predictive insights for drivers to find the fastest route. Machine learning can also be used to optimize current traffic flow by automating traffic signal timing and routing decisions to minimize delays. Additionally, machine learning can help identify high-traffic areas and areas prone to congestion, allowing city planners to consider alternate routes and measures to reduce traffic in those areas.",
