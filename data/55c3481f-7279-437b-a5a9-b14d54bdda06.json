  "input": "",
  "output": "The Schlieffen Plan was a proposed strategy developed by German military leaders in 1905 to ensure a quick and decisive victory over France and Russia in the event of a war on two fronts. The plan called for a large-scale invasion of France in order to quickly defeat it, while at the same time maintaining a defensive position on the eastern front against Russia. Its implementation was a major contributing factor to the start of World War I, as it led to Germany's violation of Belgian neutrality, which in turn caused Britain to declare war on Germany.",
