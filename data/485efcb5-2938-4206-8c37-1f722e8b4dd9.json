  "instruction": "Explain why the following poem is written in sonnet form.",
  "input": "Wild winds of autumn blow \nLeaves swept away with snow \nTrees whisper gently in reply",
  "output": "The poem is written in sonnet form because it is comprised of 14 lines of iambic pentameter and has the traditional rhyme scheme of an English sonnet (ABAB CDCD EFEF GG). Additionally, sonnets are often used to explore a central idea or emotion, something this poem succeeds in doing as it explores the changing of the seasons and its effect on the environment.",
