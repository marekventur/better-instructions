  "instruction": "How do plants regulate temperature?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Plants regulate temperature by closing their tiny pores (stomata) at night or in dry conditions, when temperatures become too high. This process of closing the stomata stops water falling out of the leaves and stops heat from entering them. Additionally, plants also release stored sugars through these pores, which can help to cool the leaves and lower the temperature around them.",
