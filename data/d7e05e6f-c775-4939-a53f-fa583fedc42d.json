  "input": "",
  "output": "Gravity is an attractive force that binds the objects in the solar system together. It is responsible for keeping the planets in their orbits, as well as maintaining the sun's position as the centre of the solar system and keeping the planets in the ecliptic plane. Without gravity, the solar system would cease to exist.",
