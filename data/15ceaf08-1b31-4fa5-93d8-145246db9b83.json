  "input": "",
  "output": "The Vietnam War began in November 1955, when North Vietnam initiated an armed conflict in order to reunite the two Vietnams divided by the agreement of the Geneva Conference. The war was primarily a result of the tension between communist North Vietnam and anti-communist South Vietnam. The fight was fueled by the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, who were providing military and economic aid to their respective sides. As the war intensified, other countries, such as China, the Soviet Union and Cambodia became involved. The war continued until April 30, 1975 when the South Vietnamese government and military forces surrendered to North Vietnamese forces, leading to the establishment of a unified Vietnam.",
