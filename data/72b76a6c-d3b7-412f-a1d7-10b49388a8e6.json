  "output": "Climate change is negatively affecting human health in a variety of ways. As temperatures rise, the spread of harmful disease-carrying insects increase, leading to an uptick in vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and Chikungunya. Heat waves, brought on by climate change, can cause heat stroke and other illnesses. Changes in air quality resulting from higher levels of greenhouse gases can also lead to increased rates of respiratory issues such as asthma and lung cancer. Finally, sea-level rise and more frequent and severe floods can lead to increased risks of water-borne diseases, mental health issues, and displacement from homes.",
