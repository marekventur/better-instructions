  "input": "",
  "output": "In economics, demand is the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at a given price level. The concept of demand considers the various influences such as income, tastes, preferences and availability on the amount of any given good or service that a consumer is willing to purchase. The demand for a good or service determines how much of it can be sold and thus, how much of it will be produced over time.",
