  "input": "Two news outlets report different numbers of coronavirus cases in a certain region.",
  "output": "In order to reconcile conflicting reports on the number of coronavirus cases in a certain region, it is important to consider the details of each report. For example, are the reports from the same day or different days? Are the reports from the same region or different regions? Is the difference within the normal variance for the region or does it represent an abnormally high or low number of cases? If possible, it is also important to consider if one of the reports is from a more reliable source and corroborate the finding with official data from the region.",
