  "output": "The stock market is a financial market where investors can buy and sell shares of public companies. Investors buy and sell shares of stock, which are units of ownership in a publicly-traded company. When stock prices rise, investors profit, and when stock prices fall, investors can face losses. The prices of a stock are determined by supply and demand in the stock market, which is determined by the buyers and sellers. Companies can also issue and sell additional shares, called secondary stocks, to raise more capital and increase their stock price.",
