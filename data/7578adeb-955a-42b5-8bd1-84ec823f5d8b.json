  "input": "",
  "output": "The U.S. Civil War was caused by a number of complex factors, including economic and social differences between the northern and southern states, states' rights issues, and the failure of compromises to bridge the differences. Slavery was at the root of the Civil War; the southern states were determined to keep slavery while the northern states sought to abolish it. This entrenched disagreement ultimately led the two sides to war.",
