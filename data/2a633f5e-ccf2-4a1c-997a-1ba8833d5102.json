  "instruction": "Construct an argument against animal testing",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Animal testing is cruel and inhumane, as animals are harmed and treated as objects instead of living beings. Animals are often exposed to toxic chemicals, electric shocks and extreme temperatures, causing them to suffer unnecessarily. Also, animal testing often produces unreliable results, as different species may respond differently to different substances. Furthermore, there are more humane options available such as cell cultures, non-animal testing methods, and in silico modelling that can be used for research instead.",
