  "output": "One way to clear a blocked drain is to pour a mixture of baking soda and vinegar down the drain. Wait a few minutes and then pour boiling water down the drain. This should loosen and dissolve any blockages. If the problem persists, you may need to use a plunger or snake to clear the clog.",
