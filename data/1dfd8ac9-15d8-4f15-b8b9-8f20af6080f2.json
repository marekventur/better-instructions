  "input": "",
  "output": "Ride-sharing apps are mobile applications that connect riders with drivers. Riders can request a ride via the app, and then the app will match them with a nearby driver. Once the ride is accepted by the driver, the rider is sent the driver's contact information and registration plate number. The rider and driver can then communicate directly to agree on a pickup and dropoff location. The app will then calculate the cost of the ride and store payment information from the rider. At the end of the ride, the rider can rate their experience and provide payment directly through the app.",
