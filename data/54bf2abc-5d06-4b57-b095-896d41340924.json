  "input": "",
  "output": "The three government systems are democracy, monarchy, and autocracy.\n\nIn a democracy, citizens have the right to vote and elect leaders to make decisions on their behalf. This system promotes equality and (in theory) prevents one leader from gaining total control over the people. It also allows citizens to directly influence the decisions of their government. \n\nIn a monarchy, a leader with inherited power, often a monarch or an emperor, has full control over the government. This leader's power is passed down from parent to child, and people have no input over the decisions of their government. \n\nIn an autocracy, any leader, such as a dictator, has full control and authority over the government. These governments are often led by a single individual or small group whose decisions are not reached democratically. This type of system allows one leader to make decisions without consulting the people they rule. \n\nUltimately, the main difference between the three government systems is the way in which those in power are chosen. Democracies are based on popular selection, monarchies are hereditary, and autocracies are ruled by a single individual or small group.",
