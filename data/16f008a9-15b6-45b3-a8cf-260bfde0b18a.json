  "instruction": "Create a device that generates electricity without a battery.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A device that generates electricity without a battery can be created by using a generator, such as a gas turbine generator, that converts a mechanical energy source, such as wind, water, steam, or solar energy, into electricity. The device would include a rotor connected to a generator, a transmission system that regulates the rotation speed, and a power converter to convert the mechanical energy into electricity.",
