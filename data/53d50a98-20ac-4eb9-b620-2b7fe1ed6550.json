  "input": "Drinking soda is bad for your health. It is often high in calories, sugar and caffeine, and can have a negative impact on your overall health over time.",
  "output": "We all know that sugary drinks like soda can often taste good, but it's important to recognize how damaging they can be to your health. Consuming soda can be a slippery slope to an array of long-term health problems, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, due to its high calorie, sugar and caffeine content. Not only this, but regularly drinking soda is quickly becoming the leading cause of tooth decay and dental problems in both adults and children. \n\nThe sugar in soda can spike your blood sugar level and cause increased appetite and cravings. This can make it much harder to maintain a healthy weight, which can leave you open to other health problems in the future. The caffeine present in soda has also been linked to sleep disturbances, and can have a negative effect on concentration levels, stress and anxiety levels. \n\nTherefore, it's important to remember the risks associated with soda consumption and make smarter choices regarding what you drink, both for your health and your wallet. Moderation is key, and there are plenty of healthier alternatives available that have the same great taste and make for a much more sensible choice.",
