  "instruction": "Design an algorithm to adjust a smartphone display brightness depending on the current lighting conditions.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm should begin by taking a photo of the current lighting conditions with the camera in the smartphone. It should then analyze the image using image processing methods and calculate the amount of light present. Based on the amount of light detected, the brightness of the display can be adjusted accordingly.",
