  "input": "",
  "output": "Two ways to improve the performance of a text classifier are feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization. Feature engineering involves creating new data features that are more indicative of the class labels. Hyperparameter optimization involves tuning the hyperparamters of the model such as the learning rate, number of layers, and number of neurons in each layer. Both of these techniques can be used to increase the accuracy and reduce the errors of text classifiers.",
