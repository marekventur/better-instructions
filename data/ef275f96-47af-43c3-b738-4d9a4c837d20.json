  "input": "",
  "output": "It\u2019s time for a major shift in the way we generate our energy. Our dependence on fossil fuels has led to a litany of problems and it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that renewable energy sources is the way forward. There are a number of reasons why this shift is necessary and the most pressing of these is addressing climate change. As the Paris Agreement highlighted, we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and this means transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. \n\nThe other major benefit of transitioning to renewable energy sources is long-term cost-savings. Fossil fuels are expensive, both in terms of money and health and environmental effects. By investing in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, we can make huge long-term savings. \n\nThe energy transition itself is going to take knowledge and investment. Political, financial, and social investments are all going to be necessary to make a meaningful transition. Governments and corporations need to look for opportunities to move towards renewable energy sources. \n\nThe good news is that there is already a lot of progress being made towards the energy transition. We have already seen some countries investing heavily in renewable energy sources and it\u2019s up to us to make sure that this progress continues. The future of our planet depends on it!",
