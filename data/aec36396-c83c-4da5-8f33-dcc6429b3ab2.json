  "input": "",
  "output": "One potential algorithm for predicting the presence of an illness is a support vector machine (SVM). An SVM is a supervised learning model that takes in data, including the patient's medical symptoms, and uses the data to create a prediction. An SVM algorithm can be trained on existing data about the illness, so that when new data about the patient's symptoms is input, the algorithm can predict the presence of the illness with a high degree of accuracy.",
