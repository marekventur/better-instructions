  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the two theories about the origin of the universe: Big Bang and Steady State.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The Big Bang theory states that the universe began from an initial singularity, that is, a point of near infinite density and heat, and has been expanding and cooling ever since. The Steady State theory proposes that the universe has always existed in an unchanged state and is constantly expanding as new matter is created to fill the expanding space. Both theories explain the expansion of the universe and its background radiation, however the Big Bang theory provides a more comprehensive explanation for the origin of the universe. Furthermore, the Big Bang theory is supported by evidence from the observations of cosmic microwave background radiation, a remnant of the initial hot and dense state of the universe.",
