  "input": "",
  "output": "A computer runs a machine learning algorithm by using input data to make predictions and then adjusting the algorithm based on the performance of the initial predictions. The algorithm uses the input data to build predictive models, which are then used to make predictions. The algorithm also tracks the accuracy of its predictions, making adjustments to the model if the accuracy is not meeting predefined goals.",
