  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change is significantly impacting ecosystems through increased temperatures, changed precipitation patterns and extreme weather events. This can have various consequences, ranging from species extinctions to entire habitat alterations. For example, changes in water availability due to droughts and extreme temperatures can cause changes in the habitat, leading to reduced plant growth, as well as fewer and less diverse sources of food for animals in the ecosystem.",
