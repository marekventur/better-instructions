  "instruction": "What is the probability of getting dealt pocket aces preflop in Texas Hold'em?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The approximate probability of being dealt pocket aces preflop in Texas Hold'em is 0.45%. This means that a player will be dealt pocket aces, on average, once approximately every 221 hands.  The odds of being dealt pocket aces twice in a row are 0.025%, which means it will happen on average once every 4000 hands.  These probabilities hold true for other types of poker too.  However, the exact odds may slightly vary depending on the number of players and cards in play.",
