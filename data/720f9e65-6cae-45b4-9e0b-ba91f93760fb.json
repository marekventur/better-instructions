  "output": "This paper studies the effects of Text Messaging on the performance of students. Studies showed that text messages increased exam scores for 6th grade students by 7.4%, compared to a control group. The messages were focused around motivation, mindfulness exercises, and study tips. These messages were found to reduce stress and anxiety associated with exams, leading to favorable outcomes. This indicates the possibility of text messages being useful for assisting student performance.",
