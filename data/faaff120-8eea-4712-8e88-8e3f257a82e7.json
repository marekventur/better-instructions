  "instruction": "Compose a two-minute piano piece",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The two-minute piano piece will begin with a slow tempo in C Major. The left hand will play a softer chordal accompaniment while the right hand plays a smoother melody line. The melody line will gradually build in intensity with higher octaves and more complex rhythms. The tempo will also increase, while the chords become slightly more dissonant with changing meters. At the climax, the piano piece will switch to a louder dynamic before ending with a resolution to the tonic chord in C Major.",
