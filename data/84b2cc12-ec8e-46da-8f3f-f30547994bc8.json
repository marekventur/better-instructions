  "input": "",
  "output": "Search engines work by indexing web content and then processing search queries against the index. This process involves bots, or software programs, that crawl the web and build an index of the content they find. When a user enters a search query, the search engine uses algorithms to process the query and retrieve the best matching results from the index.",
