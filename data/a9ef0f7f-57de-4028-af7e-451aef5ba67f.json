  "input": "",
  "output": "Setting up a wireless network is relatively easy. First, you'll need a wireless router, which connects your devices to the internet. Next, you'll need to plug the router into an internet connection and configure your settings, such as the network name and security protocols. Once the router is set up, you need to install wireless network adapters on your devices, such as computers and phones, so they can connect to the router. Finally, make sure to regularly update your router's firmware and keep your security measures up-to-date to ensure the safety of your wireless network.",
