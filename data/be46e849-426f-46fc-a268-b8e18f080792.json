  "output": "Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion can be used to explain the motion of a rocket. Newton's First Law states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This can be used to explain the upward motion of a rocket as a result of the unbalanced force created by the combustion of fuel in the rocket engine. Newton's Second Law states that force is equal to the mass of an object times its acceleration. This means that the thrust created by the combustion of fuel causes the acceleration of the rocket and allows it to overcome the gravitational pull of the Earth and reach high altitudes. Finally, Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that the exhaust from the rocket engine is expelled in the opposite direction of gravity, allowing the rocket to push against it and travel upward.",
