  "input": "The correct way to write and illustrate a story is to start with a seed idea. Then, you will use what you know\u2014 your characters, setting, and plot\u2014 to bring the story to life. This can be depicted through illustrations, captions, and dialogues. As the story comes alive, use transitions and setting descriptions to break up the sequences and drive the story forward. Finally, use the climax to show what the characters have been striving for and how their actions have resulted in a satisfying endpoint.",
