  "instruction": "Explain why computers are preferred over humans for data processing.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Computers are preferred to humans for data processing because computers are much faster and more accurate. Because they do not rely on human judgement or preferences, computers are able to process data consistently and quickly, eliminating the need for manual data entry and processing. Computers can also handle vast amounts of data, making them ideal for processing big data sets. Additionally, computers can process data in multiple languages and formats, resulting in flexible data processing.",
