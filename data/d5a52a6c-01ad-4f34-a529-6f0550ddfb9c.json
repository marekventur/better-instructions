  "input": "",
  "output": "Advantages of using neural networks for natural language processing include their ability to learn and store information, their accuracy in understanding language semantics, their ability to recognize patterns, and their relatively low computational cost. Disadvantages of neural networks for natural language processing include their black box nature, the need for large datasets for training, and their relatively slow training time.",
