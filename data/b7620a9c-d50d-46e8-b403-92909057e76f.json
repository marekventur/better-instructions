  "instruction": "Compare and contrast culture in the U.S. and in the U.K.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "In the U.S., many cultural norms are based on individualism and celebrating personal achievement, where people value their freedom and express themselves in unique ways. In the U.K., the culture is often more family-oriented and communal, where people are loyal to their community and less emphasis is placed on individual achievement. In the U.S., work often takes priority over leisure, whereas in the U.K. leisure is more valued as an integral part of life. Both cultures value politeness and courtesy in their interactions with each other, but the U.S. tends to be more informal in their approach.",
