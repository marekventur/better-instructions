  "instruction": "Calculate the average acceleration of an object that moves from a speed of 45m/s to 69m/s in 6 seconds.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The average acceleration can be calculated using the formula a = (Vf - Vi)/t, where Vf is the final velocity, Vi is the initial velocity, and t is the time elapsed. In this case, the average acceleration is (69 - 45)/6 = 8 m/s/s.",
