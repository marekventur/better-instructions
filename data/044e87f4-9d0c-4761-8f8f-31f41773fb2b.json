  "output": "To make a grilled cheese sandwich, begin by buttering each side of two slices of bread. Place a slice of cheese between the two slices of bread, and then place the sandwich in a hot pan or skillet. Cook the sandwich over medium heat until the cheese begins to melt, flipping the sandwich halfway through. Once both sides of the sandwich are golden brown, transfer the sandwich to a plate and enjoy!",
