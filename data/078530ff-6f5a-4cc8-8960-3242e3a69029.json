  "output": "It was a typical Monday morning and Jason was running late. He rushed to the subway station and was glad to see the train already there and the doors open. He stepped on, mostly empty at this hour, and settled in for his ride to work. He looked around and noticed a young woman who was singing to herself, seemingly in her own world, as she looked out the window. He wondered what her story was and what she was trying to escape from. Suddenly, the doors opened and the singing woman left, yet the mystery around her lingered in Jason's mind.",
