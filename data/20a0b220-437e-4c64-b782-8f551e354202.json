  "input": "",
  "output": "The probability of getting exactly three heads when flipping a coin four times is 1/4 or 25%. This is because there is only one combination of three heads out of a possible 4 combinations when flipping the coin four times. The other combinations consist of two heads, one head and four heads. So the probability of getting exactly three heads is 1/4 (or 25%).",
