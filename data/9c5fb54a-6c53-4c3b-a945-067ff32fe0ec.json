  "input": "",
  "output": "Urbanization can lead to a decrease in population health, as urban populations often face challenges due to overcrowding, air and water pollution, and more limited access to healthcare services. Higher population density and higher levels of poverty in urban areas can contribute to poorer health outcomes, as access to preventative measures, such as vaccinations and screenings, is often limited. Additionally, the urban environment often has higher levels of stress, violence and crime which can negatively affect mental and physical health.",
