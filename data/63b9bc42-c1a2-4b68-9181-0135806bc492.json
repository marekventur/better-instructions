  "output": "To me, diversity is celebrating and embracing individual differences and recognizing that everyone has the right to be respected, valued, and heard. It's about understanding and accepting that everyone comes from different backgrounds and experiences that can add value to the world. To me, diversity is not only about what we look like, but it is also about how we think and how we contribute to our community.",
