  "input": "",
  "output": "Acclimation is the process by which animals adapt to changes in their environment. Typically, this process involves physiological and behavioral responses to these changes. For example, if a species of animal typically inhabits cold climates, they will begin to produce more heat-resistant and insulated fur in order to survive when the climate suddenly becomes warmer. Behavioral responses to environmental changes can include alterations in feeding and sleeping patterns as well as changes in migration routes.",
