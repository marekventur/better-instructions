  "input": "",
  "output": "Both species of whales are mammals, meaning they are warm-blooded and air-breathing. They both inhabit in the ocean and feed on a diet primarily consisting of fish, krill, and other small sea creatures. \n\nThe blue whale and sperm whale differ mainly in terms of size, shape, and diet. The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth and can reach lengths of up to 33 meters and weigh up to 200 tons. On the other hand, the sperm whale is much smaller and can reach lengths of up to 18 meters and weigh up to 50 tons. The blue whale is more slender and streamlined, while the sperm whale has a larger and more robust body. Finally, the blue whale feeds mainly on krill while the sperm whale has a more varied diet consisting of squid and fish.",
