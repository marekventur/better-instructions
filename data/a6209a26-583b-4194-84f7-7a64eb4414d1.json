  "instruction": "Describe the differences between an ocean zone and a continental zone.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An ocean zone is the water area in the open ocean, typically divided into four layers based on water temperature and its effects on marine life. On the other hand, a continental zone is in coastal areas of continents, typically divided into near-shore, littoral, and offshore regions. An ocean zone is generally more open and vast with much fewer landforms and marine species, whereas continental zones tend to be more dynamic and varied with diverse landforms and a greater range of marine life. Ocean zones provide much more area for larger species due to the lack of landforms. Continental zones support more complex and varied ecosystems due to their dynamic environment, typically having greater dry land and more diverse species.",
