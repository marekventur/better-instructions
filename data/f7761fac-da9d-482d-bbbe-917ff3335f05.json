  "input": "",
  "output": "A credit card should be used in situations where you need to make a purchase now but don't have the cash on hand or want to access rewards. For example, if you want to buy something online or in a store and don't want to pay cash, you should use a credit card. Another common use case is for travel expenses, when it's better to start earning rewards for spending that you would have to do anyway.",
