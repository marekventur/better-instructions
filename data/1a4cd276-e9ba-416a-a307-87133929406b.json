  "input": "(7x + 7)/(3x + 4) = 5",
  "output": "Step 1: Multiply both sides of the equation by 3x + 4:\n\n7x + 7 = 5(3x + 4) \n\nStep 2: Simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n7x = 5(3x) + 5(4)\n\nStep 3: Expand 5(3x) + 5(4): \n7x  = 15x + 20\n\nStep 4: Subtract 15x from both sides of the equation:\n\n7x \u2013 15x = 20\n\nStep 5: Simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n-8x = 20\n\nStep 6: Divide both sides of the equation by -8:\n\nx = -2.5",
