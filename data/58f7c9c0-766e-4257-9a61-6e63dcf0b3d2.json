But no matter what life throws at me, I know that Christmas always brings a little bit of magic.\n\nI know it's a tall order, but for Christmas I would love for you to bring me the power of hope and optimism. I'm also in dire need of a little more motivation and focus, as I've been spending too much time worrying about things that I can't control.\n\nMost of all, I want to thank you for your work and everything you do. You truly make the world a better place and I am forever in your debt.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays, \n[Name]",
