  "output": "A neural network is a type of machine learning model that is composed of multiple layers of interconnected neurons (aka \"nodes\") that are organized in an interconnected network. Each node is responsible for taking an input, performing some operations on it, and then outputting a signal. The nodes share the same weights, which are modified over time through a process called training. The nodes then cooperate to solve the task they are given, such as classifying an input or making predictions on new data.",
