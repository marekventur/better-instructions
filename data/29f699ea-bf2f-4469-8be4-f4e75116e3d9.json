  "output": "A vegetarian is someone who does not eat food that contains any animal products, including meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products. Some vegetarians may also consume eggs, dairy, and other-animal derived products. It is important to note that vegetarianism is not synonymous with veganism, which is a stricter version of vegetarianism. Vegans generally avoid all animal-derived products, including honey and some wines.",
