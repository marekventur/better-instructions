  "output": "Once upon a time, there was an old hermit living in a small cabin deep in the forest. He had lived here for many years, and the locals in the nearby villages often sought out his help. With his wise words and wise decisions, he helped people in need and provided refuge for those who were in danger. He could often be found observing the forest and its inhabitants, helping them to understand the ancient teachings of the land. His guidance encouraged many to find their path in life and bring peace to their hearts.\n\nOne day, a mysterious stranger stumbled into the forest, alone and lost. The hermit's cabin was the only shelter in sight, and the stranger was in desperate need of some rest. As the hermit offered the stranger a place to sleep, he could not help but be drawn in by the story of the man's difficulty. After listening intently to the stranger, the hermit provided his wisdom and shared a few words of advise with the man; something that the stranger could take with him from his experience in the forest. \n\nThe old hermit has been living in the forest ever since, passing down his wisdom to anyone who needed it. He has become an admired part of the forest, respected by both man and animal, and is deeply missed when he is not around.",
