  "input": "",
  "output": "A stack data structure is a particular type of linear data structure that follows a Last In First Out (LIFO) approach to data storage. It can be visualized as a stack of objects, where new items are added to the top of the stack and existing items are removed from the top of the stack. Stacks are used for a wide variety of applications, ranging from memory management to expression evaluation.",
