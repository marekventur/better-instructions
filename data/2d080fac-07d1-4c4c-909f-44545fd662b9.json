  "output": "Eliminating sugar from our diet is necessary to improve health for many reasons. Sugar is a source of empty calories that can lead to weight gain over time, and can also increase the risk of certain conditions like heart disease and diabetes. Additionally, it can lead to cavities and affect our mental clarity. Eating foods that contain natural sugars instead of added sugars is recommended because natural sugars provide important nutrients and fiber, which can help to regulate our blood sugar levels. This helps promote better health overall.",
