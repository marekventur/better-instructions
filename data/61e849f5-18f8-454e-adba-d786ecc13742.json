  "instruction": "Develop a plan to hide an orange from a mischievous squirrel.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Create a squirrel-proof enclosure to hide the orange. Starting by finding a large clear container, preferably made of transparent plastic. Drill small holes in the bottom of the container to allow air to enter, and/or attach a piece of breathable fabric over these holes to allow air to circulate. Next, line the bottom of the container with a thin layer of soil, place the orange in the container, and fill the remaining space with soil. Finally, place the container in a secure part of the yard, away from any trees or overhangs that the squirrel may try to use to access the inside. Make sure to check the container occasionally to ensure that the soil is still holding up, as the squirrel may work its way around the perimeter of the container.",
