  "output": "A navigational system for a city should be designed to provide clear and accurate directions to visitors and residents. The system should account for the local geography and roads to provide the best route possible from one destination to another. It should also provide the ability to search for specific locations by address, zip code, or landmark and display the best route to them. The system should also allow drivers to save their favorite routes and receive traffic updates.",
