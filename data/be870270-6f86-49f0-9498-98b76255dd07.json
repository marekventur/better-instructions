  "input": "",
  "output": "A government may choose to impose a ban on its citizens travelling to certain countries for a number of reasons. The government may view the security situation in those countries as unsafe, or they may be concerned about the potential for their citizens to become involved in illegal activities in those countries. If a country is in the midst of ongoing conflict, a government may also impose a travel ban for the safety of its citizens. Additionally, a government may impose a ban in order to prevent the spread of dangerous communicable diseases.",
