  "output": "The evidence shows that gun control is effective in decreasing gun-related crimes. However, some opponents of gun control argue that gun control laws will not have an effect on the amount of gun-related crimes and may even lead to an increase in gun-related crime as guns will become more difficult to buy legally, contributing to the underground gun market. They further argue that the most effective way to reduce gun-related crime is to focus on the root causes of these crimes, such as poverty and lack of access to proper mental health care.",
