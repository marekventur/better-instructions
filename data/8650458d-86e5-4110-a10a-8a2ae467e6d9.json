  "output": "A human body is a complex system that consists of several interacting components. The body contains multiple organ systems that work together to carry out vital functions, such as respiration, digestion, circulation, and reproduction. All of these systems are interdependent, meaning that they must all work together in order to keep the body functioning properly. The body is also influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and diet, which can affect how the internal systems interact and function.",
