  "instruction": "Determine three benefits of an emotional support animal.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An emotional support animal (ESA) can provide several benefits to the owner.\n\nFirst, the presence of a pet can help reduce stress and anxiety by providing comfort and companionship. Simply petting a pet has been shown to reduce stress hormones and relax tense muscles, which can reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\nSecondly, an ESA can help with social interaction. Since many people find it difficult to connect with others, having a pet can provide a sense of security and reduce feelings of loneliness. The presence of a pet can make social interactions easier by providing a bridge to start conversations with other people.\n\nFinally, an ESA can help provide structure and routine in the life of its owner. Taking care of a pet can provide a sense of purpose and help establish a regular routine for the pet owner. This can be beneficial for people who may struggle with managing their own daily routine.",
