  "instruction": "How does gravity impact the movement of objects?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Gravity is the force that causes objects to accelerate towards the center of a planet or other large mass. This acceleration causes objects to move in curved paths around the planet, rather than in straight lines. Gravity also affects the motion of objects by slowing them down as they move away from the planet, and increasing their speed as they approach the planet.",
