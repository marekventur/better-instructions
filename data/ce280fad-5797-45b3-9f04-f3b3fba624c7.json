  "instruction": "How do the difference between metaphors and similes?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A metaphor is an expression used to compare two things without using like or as, while a simile is an expression used to compare two things using like or as. Metaphors provide more direct comparisons, while similes are more specific and compare two ideas in a more detailed way. For example, you might say that someone is \"as strong as an ox\" as a simile, but you might say that someone is \"an ox of strength\" as a metaphor.",
