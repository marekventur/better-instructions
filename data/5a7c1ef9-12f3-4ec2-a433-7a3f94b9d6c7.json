  "output": "In order to maintain motor oil in a car, you should check it every few weeks and top it off as needed. You should also pay attention to the quality of the oil, as it can become contaminated or broken down over time. If the oil begins to look murky or has a bad odor, it is time to have it changed. Additionally, it is important to have your car serviced regularly to check for any problems and have the oil changed if necessary.",
