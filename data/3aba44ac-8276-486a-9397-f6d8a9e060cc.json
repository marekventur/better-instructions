  "input": "Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)",
  "output": "A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of neural network that is commonly used in supervised learning tasks. It consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer takes in the input data and passes it to the hidden layers, which consist of neurons that learn the important features of the input data. Finally, the output layer produces a result based on the learned features. MLPs are extremely versatile, and are able to solve a variety of tasks ranging from pattern recognition to regression.",
