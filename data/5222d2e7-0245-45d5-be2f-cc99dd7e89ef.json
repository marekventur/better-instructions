  "input": "",
  "output": "A monopolist maximizes its profit by producing where marginal revenue equals marginal costs (MR=MC). Marginal revenue is the additional revenue a monopolist earns for one more unit of output, and marginal cost is the additional cost a monopolist incurs for one more unit of output. The monopolist will set its price at a level where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied, resulting in maximum profit.",
