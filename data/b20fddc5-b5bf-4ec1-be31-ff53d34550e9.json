  "input": "",
  "output": "Physical calendars are still useful in certain scenarios. For example, some people prefer the tactile and visual experience of writing down tasks, events, and goals on paper. For busy professionals who have long daily tasks and long-term goals, having a physical calendar and planner in front of them can help them create a sense of structure and keep them on track with their goals. Additionally, physical calendars can serve as decorative pieces on desks and walls that can motivate and inspire people.",
