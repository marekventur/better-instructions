  "input": "",
  "output": "The purpose of an aperture in a camera lens is to control the amount of light that passes through the lens. A larger aperture allows more light to pass through, and a smaller aperture allows less. By adjusting the aperture size, photographers can control the depth of field, which determines how much of the photograph is in focus.",
