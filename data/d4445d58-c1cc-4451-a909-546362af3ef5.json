  "instruction": "Design an experiment to study how the shape of a container affects the rate at which it is filled with liquid.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The experiment could involve filling two containers of the same volume and material but different shapes (e.g. a small, wide cylinder and a tall, thin cylinder) with the same amount of water. The rate of filling can then be measured by adding a predetermined amount of water to the container and timing how long it takes to fill it. The experiment can be repeated several times, and the data can then be used to compare the rate at which the containers fill.",
