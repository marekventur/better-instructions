  "instruction": "Given the input, create a template for a resume",
  "input": "Position: Business Analyst",
  "output": "I created a template for a Business Analyst resume. The resume should include a professional summary at the top, highlighting skills and experience, followed by a section on work experience that briefly outlines previous positions. Underneath that should be education, certifications and qualifications, relevant skills, and any other additional information such as awards or accolades. It should be formatted in an organized manner and highlight the most important information for the position at the top. The resume should be tailored to the company and the role, demonstrating how the applicant's experience and skills can be of value.",
