  "instruction": "What could result from the following business decision?",
  "input": "Increasing the price of a product by 10%",
  "output": "Increasing the price of a product by 10% could result in an increase in revenue due to higher prices, but also in a decrease in overall demand as customers may be reluctant to purchase the product at a higher price. It could also lead to more competition in the marketplace as other companies offer lower prices for similar products. Additionally, it could have an effect on customer loyalty, as customers may switch to other brands that offer lower prices.",
