  "input": "https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/06/child-free-women-declining-birth-rates/591843/",
  "output": "The article highlights how women are increasingly opting not to have children, due to a variety of factors such as economic and environmental concerns, cultural changes, and a shift in values. Women have more control over their reproductive decisions, and more opportunities to make a living than in generations past, pointing to greater autonomy in making their own choices. The article draws attention to the cultural stigma associated with choosing not to become a parent, and its potential to negatively affect society.",
