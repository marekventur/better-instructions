  "input": "",
  "output": "Intrinsic motivation comes from within, and is driven by a desire to satisfy personal needs and interests. It is often motivated by the joy of learning and achieving, as well as a feeling of satisfaction from mastery and personal growth. Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, is driven by external factors such as rewards, recognition, or praise. It is often motivated by external rewards such as money, fame, or status. Both types of motivation serve an important purpose, and can be used to increase motivation, productivity, and overall output.",
