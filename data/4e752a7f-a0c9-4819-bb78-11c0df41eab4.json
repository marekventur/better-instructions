  "output": "Two possible long-term effects of climate change are increased temperatures, which may lead to more extreme heat waves and increased drought, and rising sea levels, which could threaten coastal cities and other coastal habitats. Additionally, the melting of polar ice caps could cause catastrophic changes in weather and ocean current patterns, as well as affect fish and marine mammal populations.",
