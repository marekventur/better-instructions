But what exactly are you planning to do?\n\nFriend 2: Well, nothing really. I'm gonna just lay around and do nothing.\n\nFriend 1: That sounds awesome, but you might get bored.\n\nFriend 2: Nah, I'll be ok. After all, it\u2019s not like there's anything else I need to do this summer.\n\nFriend 1: I guess you're right. Nothing can beat the thrill of a doing nothing vacation!",
