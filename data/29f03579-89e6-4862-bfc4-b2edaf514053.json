  "instruction": "Analyze this tweet: \"I'm done with my studies now, there's nothing else I can do.\"",
  "input": "Tweet: \"I'm done with my studies now, there's nothing else I can do.\"",
  "output": "This tweet suggests that the person is feeling overwhelmed and unmotivated. They feel like they have reached an impasse in their studies and that there is no way forward. This could be a sign of academic burnout and a need for a break. It is important for the individual to take some time to reevaluate their studies, set achievable goals and take regular breaks to maintain a healthy mental attitude. Talking to a professional can also help if needed.",
