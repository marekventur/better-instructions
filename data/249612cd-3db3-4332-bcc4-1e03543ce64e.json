  "output": "The 2008 financial crisis was primarily caused by the collapse of the subprime mortgage industry. Banks had lent money out to people who were considered to have higher risk of defaulting on the loans, and when the housing market crashed, many of these borrowers were unable to make their payments, leading to a wave of foreclosures. This sent shockwaves through the global financial system, as banks, hedge funds, and other investors had to take huge losses due to the subprime mortgage crisis.",
