  "instruction": "Come up with a simple model to predict stock prices with given economic news.",
  "input": "The US budget deficit is expected to reach more than $1 trillion.",
  "output": "The model should consider factors like news sentiment, the type of economic news (budget deficit vs surplus), macroeconomic indicators (e.g. GDP, consumer confidence index) and company-specific data (e.g. EPS, P/E ratio). These factors should be weighted based on their relevance to stock price movements and inputted into the model.",
