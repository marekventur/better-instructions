  "input": "",
  "output": "Robots are increasingly being used in the workplace, and they can have an immense impact on the economy. By taking on the tedious and repetitive tasks, robots can free up human workers to focus on more complex, value-added tasks. This can lead to greater efficiency and productivity in the workplace. Moreover, robots can reduce costs by replacing human labor at a lower cost. In addition, because robots are faster than humans, they can increase production and reduce waste, both of which can lead to greater profits. Finally, robots can reduce the cost of training, since they don't require costly training. All of these factors make robots an attractive choice for businesses, leading to an overall boost in the economy.",
