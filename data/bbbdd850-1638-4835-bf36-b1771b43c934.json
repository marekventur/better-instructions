  "input": "Money doesn't bring happiness.",
  "output": "Many studies have shown that while money can help reduce stress and bring a sense of security, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in happiness. After individuals reach a certain level of financial stability and comfort, the amount of money they have is less important than how they spend it. Research shows that investing in experiences and relationships generally bring more joy than buying material goods.",
