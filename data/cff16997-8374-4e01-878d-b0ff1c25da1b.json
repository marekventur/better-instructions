  "input": "",
  "output": "Supervised learning requires labeled data, meaning that the data must have labels or categories indicating what the data is. This requires more effort in collecting and labeling the data to make it suitable for a supervised learning algorithm. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, does not require labelled data and can work with raw data. However, unsupervised learning can be more difficult to interpret, as it can produce results that are more difficult to interpret and those results can vary greatly depending on the algorithm used.",
