  "output": "The main differences between a jaguar and a leopard are size, physical features, habitat, and behavior. Jaguars are much bigger than leopards and they have larger skulls, stockier limbs and shorter tails. Jaguars also reside mainly in jungles and forests, while leopards prefer grasslands and savannahs. In terms of behavior, jaguars are solitary animals and more powerful and aggressive hunters than leopards.",
