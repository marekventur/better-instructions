  "input": "",
  "output": "The Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s interest rate hike will have a mixed but generally positive effect on the US economy. Short-term borrowing costs for consumers and businesses will rise, which could act as a drag on spending and investments. At the same time, higher interest rates could help attract more foreign investment into the country, which would be beneficial for the overall economy. In addition, a higher rate could also lead to an increase in jobs, which could boost consumer and business confidence and further boost the economy.",
