  "input": "The curious observation of birds appearing to fly more erratically during full moons.",
  "output": "An experiment could be designed to test the effect of light levels on bird motion. Birds could be put in a dark environment and a light environment, both of which could be compared to the natural environment during a full moon. Bird motion could be measured both in darkness and light to see if there is a significant difference in flight patterns.",
