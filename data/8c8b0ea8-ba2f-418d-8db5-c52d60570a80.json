  "input": "",
  "output": "The drawbacks of using automated processes are that they can be expensive to maintain and require specialized knowledge to set up and operate. Additionally, automated processes often require regular monitoring and tweaking, as the sheer complexity of the process can cause unforeseen errors to occur. Automated processes can also force the user to be confined to a specific input format, often making it difficult to make changes or updates. Finally, automated processes lack the creativity and flexibility of a human operator and can lead to mistakes in situations that require a creative solution.",
