  "instruction": "For the given dataset, develop a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm to predict the future value of the stock.",
  "input": "Dataset: Daily closing prices of Apple Inc. stock over a period of 12 months.",
  "output": "The Reinforcement Learning algorithm would first feed in a set of daily closing prices of Apple Inc. stock over a period of 12 months. The algorithm would then be trained on the data to predict the future value of the stock. The algorithm will use the daily closing prices as features and the target value as the future stock price. It would use reinforcement learning techniques to identify patterns in the data and gradually adjust the algorithm's strategy for predicting the future value. The algorithm would be able to adjust its strategy as the market evolves, allowing it to make more accurate predictions and better inform investment decisions.",
