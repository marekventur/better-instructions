  "input": "",
  "output": "Digital journalism and traditional journalism are similar in that they both report news and information. However, they differ in many ways. Traditional journalism relies on print media, while digital journalism is more reliant on technology and the internet. Digital journalism is often more up-to-date, with real-time updates and access to multimedia content. On the other hand, traditional journalism produces more in-depth analysis and investigative reporting.",
