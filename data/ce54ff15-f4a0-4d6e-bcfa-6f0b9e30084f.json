  "output": "The main differences between Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Data Mining (DM) are as follows. ML is a type of AI which deals with algorithms that can learn from data by developing models which can predict and recognize patterns in data. DL is a subset of ML which uses multiple layers of neural networks to learn from data and automatically identify and classify patterns. DM is the process of extracting meaningful information from data. It involves gathering, verifying, and analyzing large amounts of data to uncover patterns and trends.",
