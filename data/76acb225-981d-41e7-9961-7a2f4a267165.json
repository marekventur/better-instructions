  "output": "The United Nations declared in 2011 that water and sanitation are human rights, meaning that everyone should have access to safe and clean drinking water as well as proper hygiene. This introduced a universal standard that every nation must meet in terms of delivering these basic resources. It also recognized the importance of access to water in particular for other human rights, such as the right to health, food, and an adequate standard of living. As a result, many countries have developed strategies to ensure access to water for all. This includes improving infrastructure such as water supply systems and wastewater treatment, as well as strengthening regulation and monitoring of water resource usage.",
