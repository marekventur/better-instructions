  "input": "",
  "output": "The First World War was caused by the interactions between multiple nations, which created a tense atmosphere of competition and distrust. The conflict began with the rise of militarism, which led the European countries to focus on gaining power and control. Nationalism was also a major factor, causing countries to place their own interests before that of any other. The strategic system of alliances that had been put in place by the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance also contributed to this conflict as countries were forced to honor their commitments to one another during any conflict. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 was considered to be the tipping point, leading to a declaration of war and the onset of the First World War.",
