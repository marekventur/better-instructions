  "input": "",
  "output": "Nature versus nurture is the debate between whether human behavior is determined by inherited genes and traits or if it is shaped by environment and experiences. Nature-focused theorists believe that biological factors such as genetics and hormones are the primary influences on behavior, while nurture-focused theorists believe that behavior is determined by environmental influences such as parental rearing and social interaction. While it is clear that both nature and nurture play a role in determining human behavior, the exact balance and contribution of each is still an area of discussion and debate.",
