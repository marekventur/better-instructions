  "output": "The Arctic Fox is a small mammal that lives in the Arctic tundra and is well adapted for living in extreme cold climates. It has thick fur, short legs, and a short muzzle to help it conserve energy. Its wide feet help it spread its body weight on soft snow, and its dense fur helps it to remain warm in the cold. It can often be seen scavenging on polar bears' leftovers.",
