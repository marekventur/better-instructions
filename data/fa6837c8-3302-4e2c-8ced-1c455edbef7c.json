It allows us to protect ourselves and prevent further injury, while also allowing us to learn how to use our bodies in a controlled and refined manner. Self-defense skills also help to prevent and manage potentially dangerous situations, while furthering our understanding of how to use martial arts as a form of self-expression.",
