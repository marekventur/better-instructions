  "output": "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which a computer learns from labeled training data and uses that data to predict the output for new data. It is important because it allows computers to learn from labeled data and make predictions about unseen data, which can be very useful in many applications. For example, supervised learning is used to identify objects in an image or to detect if an email is spam or not. Supervised learning is an essential tool in artificial intelligence and machine learning because it provides a powerful way to leverage existing data to solve problems.",
