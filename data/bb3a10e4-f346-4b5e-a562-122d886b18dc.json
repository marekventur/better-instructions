  "output": "In the year 2275, humans had colonized the nearby planet of Axonis. After years of living peacefully, tensions arose between the two inhabiting species: humans and the native Axonites. The Axonites were incredibly intelligent and powerful, and they were resentful of the humans' expanding influence. The humans were eager to protect their new home and their resources, so a war between the two races seemed inevitable. The fate of the planet lay in the hands of a small group of humans and Axonites who had formed a secret alliance in hopes of preventing the destruction of both of their homes. Could they find a way for peace or would war consume them all?",
