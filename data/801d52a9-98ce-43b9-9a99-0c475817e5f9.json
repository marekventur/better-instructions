  "input": "",
  "output": "Recursion is an important concept in computer science as it allows for efficient and concise solutions to problems by using a repeated process. It allows for more complex tasks to be broken down into simpler steps, reducing the amount of code needed to solve a given problem. This makes the code more efficient, allowing for more complex tasks to be handled in a fraction of the time. Additionally, recursion helps to reduce the complexity of a problem by allowing the same code to be used again and again, rather than writing new code each time.",
