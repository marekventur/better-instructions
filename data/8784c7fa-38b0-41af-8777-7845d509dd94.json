Generally, the production of a digital product requires fewer resources, such as coal, water, and petroleum, than producing a physical product. Additionally, shipping a digital product requires no raw materials or packaging materials. Compared to physical products, digital products have a lower degree of carbon emissions, water usage, and waste generation during production.
