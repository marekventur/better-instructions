  "instruction": "Suggest a healthy diet plan for a 5-year-old",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A healthy diet plan for a 5-year old should include a variety of nutrient-dense foods from all the food groups. It should consist of five to six small meals a day, instead of three large ones. The diet should be rich in whole grains such as oatmeal, quinoa, and brown rice. Fruits, vegetables, lean meats, nuts and seeds, dairy products and healthy fats should also be included. Children this age usually need approximately 1,000 - 1,400 calories a day, so it is important to make sure the diet plan is designed accordingly.",
