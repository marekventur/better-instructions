  "input": "",
  "output": "I hypothesize that different cooking times are needed for foods of varying texture because the rate of heat transfer from the heat source to the food increases or decreases depending on the texture of the food. For example, softer foods like fruits and vegetables will cook quicker than harder foods like potatoes, which are more dense and rigid. In addition, food with a higher moisture content will cook more quickly than food with a lower moisture content.",
