  "instruction": "Explain why a vector with magnitude 5 is twice as long as a vector with magnitude 10?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A vector with magnitude 5 has a length that is exactly half that of a vector with magnitude 10 because the magnitude of a vector is proportional to its length. That is, a vector with a magnitude of 10 will be twice as long as a vector with a magnitude of 5. In other words, when two vectors have different magnitudes, the vector with a higher magnitude will always be longer than the vector with a lower magnitude. This is because the magnitude of a vector determines how much \u201clength\u201d it has. Therefore, a vector with magnitude 5 is always going to be half as long as a vector with magnitude 10.",
