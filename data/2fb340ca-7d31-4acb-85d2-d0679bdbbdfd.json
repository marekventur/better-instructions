  "output": "One way to celebrate someone's birthday during social distancing is to have a virtual birthday party! You can use one of the many video conferencing apps to have a virtual gathering with friends, family, and colleagues. You can have everyone bring a few ingredients and contribute to making a cake or special dish while they tell stories and share memories of their friendship. If you can\u2019t all get together, you can have everyone send a video message or picture and string them together into a personalized video montage. \n\nAnother idea is to have a virtual scavenger hunt. Give clues and map out tasks for participants to complete online. You can even make it competitive by tracking how many tasks each player completes. \n\nYou can also have a themed movie night! Have everyone watch the same movie or show and discuss it afterwards. You can even do game nights as well. Games such as trivia and charades can be easily adapted for a virtual setting. \n\nSocial distancing doesn't have to stop you from celebrating a special day! With a bit of creativity, you can still make the day special for someone.",
