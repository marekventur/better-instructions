  "input": "",
  "output": "A wheel can be used as part of a game or an activity. For example, it could be used as part of an obstacle course with a wheel rolling down a runway, or it could be used to create a makeshift seesaw that kids can play on. Another idea could be to use a wheel as part of an impromptu game of wheel hockey, where participants have to hit a small object with the wheel. Creative uses could also include using a wheel as part of a larger art piece or using multiple wheels to create a kinetic sculpture. The possibilities with a wheel are endless!",
