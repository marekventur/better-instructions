  "input": "",
  "output": "Falcons are swift and powerful birds of prey, named for their characteristic long, pointed wings and the sharp talons they use to catch their prey. They feed mainly on medium-sized birds, reptiles, and other small animals. Falcons are known for their remarkable flying technique, which involves hovering and sudden dives to hunt prey. They often live in open country or along the edge of forests, nesting in trees, rocks or cliffs. Falcons rely on their speed and agility to escape predators and can fly at speeds up to 200 mph. They are highly territorial and fiercely protect their nests.\n \nFalcons have long tail feathers and long wings adapted for quick maneuvering in the air. They can be recognized by their distinctive black hoods and gray backs, with bright yellow or orange beaks. Having a keen vision, these birds can spot their prey from the air while they are flying. Their eyes feast on color and movement and they listen for the sound of small birds when they hunt. Falcons also use special calls to communicate with each other and with their mates.",
