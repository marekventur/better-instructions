  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Data Availability and Quality: GPT models require labelled data for training and need properly annotated datasets for domain specific deployment.\n2. Model Explainability: GPT models are notoriously difficult to explain and understand.\n3. Compute Requirements: GPT models require a lot of compute resources.\n4. Scaling of Models: GPT models with large datasets can be difficult to scale.\n5. Model Drift: GPT models may not be able to generalize to changing environments.",
