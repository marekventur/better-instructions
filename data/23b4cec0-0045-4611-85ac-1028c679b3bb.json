  "output": "Here are three techniques for delivering customer feedback to a product team: \n1. Surveys: Conducting surveys is an effective way to collect customer feedback. You can measure satisfaction, assess feature preferences, identify potential issues, and monitor customer loyalty. Surveys can be delivered to customers via email, online forms, online chat, or physical mail. \n\n2. Focus Groups: Focus groups are a great way to get detailed and qualitative feedback from customers. They can be conducted in person or online, depending on the size of the customer base. These groups can provide insight into customer behavior, preferences, and needs. \n\n3. Usability Tests: Usability tests are used to measure the usability and user experience of a product or website. These tests typically involve asking users to complete a series of tasks, which can provide feedback on how easy it is to use the product as well as any issues encountered.",
