  "instruction": "What is the blockchain",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The blockchain is a secure, distributed database technology that records and stores information distributed across a network of computers. It is decentralized, meaning no single authority manages it, and as such allows for trustless or peer-to-peer transactions to occur. Information stored on the blockchain is immutable, as it is secured with sophisticated cryptographic algorithms and techniques, making it impossible to be faked or altered. It is also transparent, as all changes to the blockchain are public records that can be tracked and verified by anyone.",
