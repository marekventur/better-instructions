  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm for a sorting machine involves first taking input, followed by organizing the objects into two or more groups depending on a certain criteria such as size or type. Then, each group can be further sorted using a variety of methods such as insertion sort, selection sort, or bubble sort. Ultimately, the sorted objects can be output to make sure the sorting process is complete.",
