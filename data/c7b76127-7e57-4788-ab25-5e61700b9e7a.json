  "input": "",
  "output": "The \"butterfly effect\" is a term used to describe the chaotic nature of weather systems which states that small changes in initial conditions can produce large, unpredictable results. It is based on the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings in one corner of the world can cause a thunderstorm in the other corner of the world. This phenomenon is also referred to as sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and it highlights how small changes can lead to immense differences in outcomes over time.",
