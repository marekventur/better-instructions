  "input": "",
  "output": "The Taj Mahal has a unique optical illusion - from certain angles, the mausoleum appears to be different sizes. For example, from the entry gate, the marble tomb seems to lessen in size, while from the river, it appears to increase in size. This illusion is due to the way the structure was designed, with its reflection in the pool used to create a sense of additional space and openness.",
