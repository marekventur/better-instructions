You faced so many obstacles and had to make tough decisions to get us to where we are today, and I want you to remember that all your hard work was worth it. You faced so many hardships, but eventually, those moments of difficulty passed. There will be other silver linings, too. I'm so proud of all that you have accomplished and the way that you continue to rise and stay strong. \n\nYou are so incredibly resilient, and don't ever forget that. Life is beautiful \u2014 it's up to you to find all the colors and appreciate them. Don't stop believing in yourself and in all that you can do. \n\nLove, \nYour Older Self",
