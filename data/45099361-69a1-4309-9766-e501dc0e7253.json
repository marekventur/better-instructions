Even though they were unlikely friends, they shared all sorts of adventures together, and the tree taught the rabbit life lessons every day. From daring escapes and inside jokes to sharing secrets and getting into all sorts of trouble, their friendship flourished and their bond grew stronger and stronger until one day, when the tree suddenly disappeared, leaving behind only the memories of their special friendship.",
