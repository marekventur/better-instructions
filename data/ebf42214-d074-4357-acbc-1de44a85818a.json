  "instruction": "Compare two fruits and determine which is healthier.",
  "input": "Apple | Orange",
  "output": "Both apples and oranges are healthy fruits that are packed with essential nutrients. However, due to its high fiber content, an apple is considered the healthier option of the two, as it helps to fill you up and regulate your blood sugar levels. Oranges are rich in Vitamin C, but their sugar content makes them less beneficial than an apple in terms of overall health.",
