  "instruction": "Design a bike with a stable center of gravity",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A bike with a stable center of gravity should be designed with the frame and saddle as low to the ground as possible. The frame should also be wide and sturdy to provide a stable base. The gears and brakes should also be placed offering the most balanced weight distribution. The wheel size should be appropriate for the rider\u2019s weight and height, while also ensuring that the center of gravity is low to the ground.",
