  "output": "Holography is a technique that records the light scattered from an object, and then presents it in a way that appears three-dimensional. It is used in a variety of applications such as security, entertainment and education. Holography utilizes lasers, optics, and photographic film which allows it to capture visual information in ways not possible with conventional photography. Holograms are usually produced in the form of holographic plates, holographic prints, or computer generated holograms. The technology has the potential to be used for data storage, communication, augmented reality, and even home entertainment.",
