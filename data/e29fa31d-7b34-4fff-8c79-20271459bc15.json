  "output": "Photosynthesis is a process by which plants and some other organisms convert light energy from the Sun into chemical energy and use it to produce carbohydrates such as sugars. This process occurs when chlorophyll, a molecule found in plants, absorbs light energy. The energy is then used to produce glucose molecules that are used as a food source for the plant. Oxygen is also produced as a by-product of photosynthesis. In addition to producing energy for the plant, photosynthesis also helps remove carbon dioxide from the environment and adds oxygen to it, making it necessary for life on Earth.",
