  "output": "A typical cell consists of a membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, nucleolus, mitochondria, and various other organelles. The membrane encloses the other components and separates the cell from its environment. The cytoplasm is a semi-liquid layer within the cell's membrane. It contains the organelles and is the site of most biochemical reactions. The nucleus contains genetic material, while the mitochondria is responsible for energy production. Other organelles include endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.",
