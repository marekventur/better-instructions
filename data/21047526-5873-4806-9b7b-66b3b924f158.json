  "output": "One suggestion to prevent ocean acidification is to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. This can be done by investing in and adopting renewable energy, planting more trees to absorb carbon dioxide, and encouraging sustainable farming practices. Additionally, ocean-based solutions such as restoring marine life populations and increasing protection of ocean habitats can help to reduce ocean acidification.",
