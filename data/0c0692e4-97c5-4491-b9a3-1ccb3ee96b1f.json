  "input": "",
  "output": "An effective problem solving approach for reducing water pollution in a large city should involve multiple stakeholders. The first step would be to engage the community and stakeholders, such as local and state government organizations, industry experts, environmental groups, and scientific institutions, in order to understand the root causes and the scope of the problem. Based on the collected data, solutions can be designed and implemented. Possible solutions include those that reduce inputs of pollutants, those that physically remove contaminants, and those that restore habitats and ecosystems. Additionally, public education and outreach should be implemented in order to support the effort to reduce water pollution.",
