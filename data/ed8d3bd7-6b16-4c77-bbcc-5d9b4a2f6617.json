The people of the village had a strange problem \u2013 they were plagued by ghosts in their homes.\n\nOne day, one of the elders of the village decided to take matters into their own hands. He marched up to the top of the highest mountain and summoned the spirits, commanding them to leave the village in peace.\n\nThe ghosts heard his plea, and were moved by his courage and wisdom. They thanked the elder and left the village forever. The villagers were happy to be free of the spirits, and to this day, they tell the tale of the brave elder who banished the ghosts.",
