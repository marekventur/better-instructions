  "input": "",
  "output": "Customer service agents should always use positive language when dealing with customers, as this reflects a positive attitude and encourages customers to remain loyal. Positive language helps foster trust, encourages open dialogue, and creates a more relaxed atmosphere. It conveys a sense of understanding, respect, and empathy and helps to maintain a higher level of customer satisfaction. Additionally, customers are more likely to remember a positive experience than a negative one, so agents should strive to make every interaction as pleasant and positive as possible.",
