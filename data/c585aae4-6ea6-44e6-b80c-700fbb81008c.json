  "output": "I was recently tasked with the challenge of needing to create an effective referral program that would be easy to administrate. My solution was to set up a forum where people could discuss their experience with the product and give their own referral codes, which in turn would help to drive more signups with customers being incentivized to refer their friends. I also created a separate page on the website listing out the features of the referral program and outlining the benefits of joining. This created a fool-proof system that was both easy to manage and highly effective in driving referrals.",
