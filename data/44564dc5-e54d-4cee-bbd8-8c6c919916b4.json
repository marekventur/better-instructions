  "output": "Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to convert sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into energy, which is stored in the form of sugar. During photosynthesis, plants produce oxygen as a byproduct. Sunlight is absorbed by the leaves, which converts the energy it contains into chemical energy. The carbon dioxide is taken in through the leaves, then combined with water to form the sugars that are the building blocks for the plants' growth.",
