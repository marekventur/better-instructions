  "output": "The Salem Witch Trials took place in colonial Massachusetts between 1692 and 1693. Hundreds of people were accused of witchcraft, leading to death sentences for many individuals. Despite a lack of evidence, people were convicted on the basis of spectral evidence and other seemingly supernatural occurrences. In the aftermath, the Massachusetts General Court declared these trials unlawful and issued compensation for some of the families of those wrongfully convicted.",
