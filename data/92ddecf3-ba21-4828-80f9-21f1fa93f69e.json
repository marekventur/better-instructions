  "output": "Multi-label classification is a supervised learning technique where a single output example can belong to more than one class. This technique is useful for tasks that involve assigning multiple labels to an input example. For example, a task may require predicting all labels that describe the contents of an image such as, \u201csports\u201d, \u201coutdoors\u201d, \u201cindoors\u201d. Such tasks can be solved by multi-label classification models which are made up of multiple classifiers that each handle one label. The input example is first classified by a base model that predicts the most likely labels. Subsequently, the labels which have a confidence score above a certain threshold are chosen by the model. The multi-label classification model can learn correlations between related labels and can even predict layers of labels like a taxonomy.",
