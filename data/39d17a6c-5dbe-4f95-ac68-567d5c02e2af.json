  "instruction": "Construct a dialogue between two people having a disagreement about a given topic.",
  "input": "Topic - Education",
  "output": "Person 1: \"Education should be free for everyone regardless of income.\" \nPerson 2: \"I disagree. If education was free, everyone would take advantage of it and it would create overcrowded classrooms and create a strain on resources.\" \nPerson 1: \"But that could be avoided by regulating the amount of people who can attend each school.\" \nPerson 2: \"Yes, but that would become a bureaucracy. Do you really want to rely on the government to determine who can and cannot receive an education?\" \nPerson 1: \"But tuition costs are becoming increasingly difficult to afford and are preventing many people from getting the education they need. Free education should be an option, otherwise income will remain an obstacle for acquiring knowledge.\" \nPerson 2: \"Maybe, but I think a better solution is for the government to create grants and scholarships to make education more accessible for those who can't afford it.\"",
