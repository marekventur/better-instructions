Whether it's listening to my problems or giving me advice, it has been a great help and I am so thankful for your friendship.\n\nYou have been there for me through some of the most trying times of my life, and I can't thank you enough for that. Even when things seem bleak and hopeless, I know I can turn to you for support and encouragement. I really appreciate it. \n\nWithout you, I don't know where I would be. Your friendship is a constant in my life and I am so grateful for it. \n\nThanks again.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]",
