  "output": "The best way to store fresh berries is to keep them in the refrigerator since it will help preserve their flavor and texture. When storing them, make sure that the berries are placed in a single layer on a shallow container lined with paper towels. Berries tend to spoil quickly, so it is best to use them within a few days of purchase.",
