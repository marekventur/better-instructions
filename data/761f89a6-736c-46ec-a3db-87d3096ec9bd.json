  "output": "The main antagonist in Ocean's 11 is Terry Benedict, a successful casino owner and Julie's (Julia Roberts) ex-boyfriend. He eventually discovers the group's master plan and subsequently takes strong measures to ensure that they are apprehended and brought to justice. He is determined and ruthless, willing to stop at nothing to ensure that the group fails. Despite his aggression, he is fairly reasonable and understands when Danny Ocean (George Clooney) tries to ensure that his friends are not imprisoned or hurt, and ultimately only takes a cash settlement out of his casino vault as recompense.",
