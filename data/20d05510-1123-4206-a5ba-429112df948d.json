  "instruction": "Compare and contrast two types of computer networks.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "There are two main types of computer networks: Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). \n\nLANs are typically used in small geographic areas such as businesses and homes, and involve connecting multiple computers in a single region using a common communications protocol. They are usually limited to a few miles in size and provide high-speed connections between users.\n\nIn contrast, WANs connect computers over large geographic areas and often span multiple countries. They use dedicated leased lines such as cables or satellite signals to connect multiple LANs together. As such, they are slower than LANs due to the distance involved.\n\nEach type of network has its own advantages and disadvantages, and which network is more suitable will depend on the context of the given situation.",
