  "output": "The best way to minimize stress in the workplace is to create healthy work-life balance by setting boundaries between work and home. It's important to manage time effectively by prioritizing tasks and projects so that your workload feels manageable. Taking regular breaks and using stress-reduction strategies like yoga, meditation and deep breathing can help reduce the buildup of stress. Having open communication with coworkers and supervisors can also help to reduce stress, as well as fostering a supportive, positive work environment. Finally, don't be afraid to ask for help when needed and make sure to take time for self-care.",
