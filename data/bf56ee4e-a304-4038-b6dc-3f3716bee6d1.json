  "instruction": "Rewrite the formula $y = \\frac{2x-1}{3}$ so that it can be solved for x.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The formula can be rewritten so that it can be solved for x by multiplying both sides by 3 and adding 1, resulting in the equation $3y+1 = 2x$. This can then be rearranged to $2x = 3y+1$ and solved for x by dividing both sides by 2, resulting in the equation $x = \\frac{3y+1}{2}$.",
