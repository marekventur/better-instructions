  "instruction": "Hypothesize why Australia has over 140 snake species.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the main reasons why Australia has over 140 snake species is its large geographic area and wide range of climates. Australia is a large island continent with a huge variety of habitats. This climate diversity provides a rich and diverse ecosystem, allowing snakes to live in many different climates and make the most of the diverse food sources available. Additionally, many of Australia\u2019s species of snakes have evolved over time to adapt to different climates and occupy new habitats. This has allowed them to become well adapted to living in Australia and to survive in ever-changing environments.",
