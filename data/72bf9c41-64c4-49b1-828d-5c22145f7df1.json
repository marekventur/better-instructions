Begin by marinating diced chicken in a marinade made of olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper for 10 minutes. Then, heat a pan over high heat, and saut\u00e9 the chicken until it is cooked through, about 8 minutes. In a large bowl, combine diced mango, cucumber, red onion, fresh cilantro, and diced jalapeno. Then, top with the cooked chicken and a dressing of your choice, such as lime and honey. Serve over a bed of lettuce or spinach, and enjoy!",
