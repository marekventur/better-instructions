  "output": "The TV rating system for parents is designed to help parents make informed decisions about what content is appropriate for their children to watch. Content is assigned a rating based on language, sexual content, violence, and any other factors that may be inappropriate for children. The ratings range from \u2018Y\u2019 (suitable for all ages) to \u2018X\u2019 (not suitable for any age). These ratings appear on all advertisements for TV shows and movies, as well as on the content itself.",
