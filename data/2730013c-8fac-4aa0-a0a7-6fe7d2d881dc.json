  "output": "Class: NIGHT\nDescription: A night is a period of time in which darkness prevails, usually that which lies between the setting and rising of the sun. On the average evening, the person may be indulging themselves in activities such as watching a favorite show on tv, reading a book, or simply spending time with their family and friends. Bedtime tends to vary depending on the individual, but the majority of people tend to drift off to sleep sometime between 9 pm and 11 pm. A good night's sleep is an essential part of an individual's health and wellness, ensuring that mental and physical energy is restored for the following day.",
