  "output": "The challenges of deep learning include the following:\n\n1. Data processing: the need to process large amounts of data in order to accurately train deep learning models.\n2. Model capacity: limited computing resources that can lead to models with limited model capacity.\n3. Interpretability: deep models may produce results that are hard to interpret and explain.\n4. Overfitting: deep learning models may succumb to overfitting due to large datasets and complex structures.\n5. Computational costs: deep learning models require extensive computational resources that are often costly.\n6. Limited generalization ability: while deep models can achieve impressive results on specific tasks, they may lack the generalization ability to adapt to new tasks.",
