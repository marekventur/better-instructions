  "output": "Long-term unemployment can have both positive and negative effects. On the plus side, people who are unemployed for a long period of time can use this opportunity to upskill and improve their resumes. They also may have a greater focus on personal development, such as hobbies and volunteer work. However, long-term unemployment can have a significant impact on one's sense of self-worth and mental health, as well as their finances. People who have been unemployed for a long time face a greater risk of poverty and homelessness, and may have difficulty re-entering the labor market. It is important for people in this situation to access resources and support to help them get back on their feet.",
