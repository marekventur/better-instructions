  "output": "\"The Starry Night\" by Vincent Van Gogh is a timeless depiction of a starlit sky over a rural village symbolizing uncertainty, beauty and mystery. The painting was created in 1889, during Van Gogh's time in the asylum in Saint-Remy-de-Provence, and displays an exquisite blend of blues, greens and yellows that intermingle along with the movement of the stars and the village below. The iconic painting is a classic example of Van Gogh's innovative use of color, light and movement to convey emotion and drama. It remains one of the world's most beloved and recognizable works of art today.",
