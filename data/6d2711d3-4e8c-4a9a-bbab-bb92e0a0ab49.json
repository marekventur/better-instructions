  "input": "",
  "output": "A thermometer is an instrument used to measure temperature. It works by taking advantage of the fact that certain materials, such as mercury and alcohol, expand more when heated and contract when cooled. When these materials are housed in a thermometer, it allows for accurate temperature readings. The bulb at the end of a thermometer has a liquid that rises and falls in accordance with the temperature. The movement of the liquid is gauged by the markings on the thermometer and a meaningful temperature is given accordingly.",
