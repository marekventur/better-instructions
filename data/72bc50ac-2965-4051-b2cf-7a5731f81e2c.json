  "input": "",
  "output": "The United States has a complex healthcare system that is a mix of public and private providers and insurers. The public sector includes Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as medical and veteran services. Private health insurance is provided by employers and other private insurers, such as through the Affordable Care Act. The US healthcare system is largely market-based, with uncertainty in costs and access to healthcare leading to disparities in healthcare outcomes. The cost of healthcare is the highest in the world, due largely to the high prices of drugs and medical procedures. In addition, access among those who are uninsured or underinsured is challenging, resulting in the US ranking lower than other developed countries in terms of overall healthcare performance.",
