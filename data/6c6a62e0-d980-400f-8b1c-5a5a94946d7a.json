  "input": "Public transportation should be free.",
  "output": "Public transportation should be free because it would encourage citizens to use it more frequently and reduce traffic congestion. This would improve air quality, reduce emissions from vehicles, and save money from gasoline and vehicle maintenance costs. Public transportation is also an important form of public infrastructure, so it should receive the same level of subsidies and funding as roads and other infrastructure.",
