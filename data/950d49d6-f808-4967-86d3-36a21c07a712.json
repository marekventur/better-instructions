The change was sparked by global warming, and the storm tore apart the northern and eastern seaboards of the United States. The movie follows the main characters as they attempt to survive an ice age, a sheet of ice, tornadoes, and an enormous typhoon. Ultimately, the storm passes and the world is brought back to its previous state.",
