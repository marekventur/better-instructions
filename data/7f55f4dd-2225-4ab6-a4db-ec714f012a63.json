  "input": "",
  "output": "A supervised learning algorithm such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or a Decision Tree could be used to classify emails. These algorithms use labelled training data to create a classification model which can then be used to classify incoming emails. These algorithms can also be used to detect spam or malicious emails.",
