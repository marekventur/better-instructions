  "output": "3G and 5G are two generations of mobile technology. 3G networks are more widespread and offer speeds up to 14.4 Mbps while 5G networks offer much higher speeds, up to 10 Gbps. 5G networks also provide higher capacity, lower latency, more efficient bandwidth utilization, and improved reliability. However, 5G networks will require more infrastructure and equipment, making it more expensive to deploy.",
