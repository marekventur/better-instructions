  "input": "",
  "output": "Recycling can help reduce your carbon footprint by diverting materials from landfills, where they would generate methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Recycling can also reduce energy use, as it takes less energy to process materials that have already been used, compared to creating materials from scratch. Additionally, recycling can reduce air pollution from production of new products, and water pollution from runoff of chemicals used in manufacturing. All of these factors contribute to a lower overall carbon footprint.",
