  "output": "A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its pull. It is formed when a massive star dies and collapses in on itself, creating an area of infinite density and an event horizon that marks the point at which any matter or light that enters cannot escape.",
