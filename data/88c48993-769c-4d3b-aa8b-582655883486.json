  "instruction": "Describe the process of how an object remains in equilibrium.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An object is said to be in equilibrium when there are no net forces acting on it. This means that the sum of all the forces that are currently acting on the object must be equal to 0. This is usually described by Newton's first law of motion which states that when the sum of all forces acting on an object is equal to 0, it will remain at rest or if it is in motion, it will remain in motion with a constant velocity.",
