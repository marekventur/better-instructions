  "input": "",
  "output": "Manufacturing one car has a significant environmental impact. The production of cars involves source emissions, as well as chemicals and hazardous materials. Cars will also emit various air pollutants such as NOx, HC and CO, which are responsible for numerous health and environmental problems, such as smog, acid rain and global warming. In addition to air pollution, car manufacturing can impact water resources and biodiversity, due to the use of pollutants and hazardous materials. Furthermore, the disposal of cars and their parts has a negative environmental impact due to the metals and other materials used in their construction.",
