  "output": "I would design a website that allows travelers to easily find and access useful information. The website can feature a range of topics such as the best places to visit, the cheapest flights, detailed maps of different cities, advice from other travelers, and more. This can be enhanced by an interactive map feature, allowing users to search for specific destinations and see what attractions are nearby. Furthermore, useful links for quick access to booking hotels and creating travel itineraries would be featured as well. Overall, my website would be an easy-to use resource for any traveler seeking helpful tips and advice.",
