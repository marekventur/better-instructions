  "output": "A double helix is a shape in which two intertwined spirals form a helix structure. It resembles a twisted ladder, with the spirals connected at regular intervals by a cross-like structure. It is commonly found in DNA, which is a molecule composed of two strands of nucleotides wrapped around each other to form a double helix.",
