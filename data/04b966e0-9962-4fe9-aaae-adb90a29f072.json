  "instruction": "Discuss one key difference between abstraction and encapsulation.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The key difference between abstraction and encapsulation is that abstraction focuses on hiding the details of an implementation, whereas encapsulation focuses on restricting access to the details of an implementation, thereby providing enhanced security. Abstraction is a concept-level technique of hiding complexities, while encapsulation is an object-level technique of data and code access control. Abstraction is concerned with the logical view of an object, while encapsulation is concerned with the physical view of an object.",
