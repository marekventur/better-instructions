  "input": "",
  "output": "The Agile software development methodology is based on three main principles: 1) individuals and interactions over processes and tools, 2) working software over comprehensive documentation, and 3) customer collaboration over contract negotiation. The main goal of Agile is to deliver better software faster, with a focus on values such as collaboration, self-organization, and continuous learning throughout the project. Other principles of Agile development include incremental builds, feature-driven development, short and iterative development cycles, and the use of automated testing.",
