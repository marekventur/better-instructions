  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a voiceless bird who found itself in a dark forest. The bird felt terribly alone and scared, and its fear was only amplified by the absolute silence of the woodland. \n\nOne day, the bird encountered a flock of other birds. To its wonder and relief, these birds were chirping happily, letting the long forgotten melody of life seep through each of the bird's feathers. The voiceless bird had never been so grateful and mesmerized before, and so it sang along with them. \n\nThe flock surrounded the voiceless bird, teaching it how to sing with the rising and falling of their voices. With every chirp and trill, the voiceless bird gained more and more confidence until it was singing along as loudly as the rest of them. \n\nSince then, the voiceless bird has been inseparable from its newly adopted family, and it continues to spread its song with joy and fervor.",
