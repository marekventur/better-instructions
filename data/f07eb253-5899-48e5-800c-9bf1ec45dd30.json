  "output": "When completing an important task, it is important to make a plan and break down the task into smaller, more manageable chunks. Prioritize the tasks that need to be done first, and set deadlines for each task. Having a timeline will help you stay motivated and on track. Break the task down into achievable steps and work on them one at a time. Make sure to reward yourself after each accomplishment, and allow yourself plenty of breaks in between.",
