  "input": "",
  "output": "My advice for finding an internship is to start by doing research and networking. Ask people in your field what opportunities may be available or what companies may be hiring. Look online for postings and apply to any that interest you. Utilize social media such as LinkedIn to search for relevant postings and connect with potential employers. Make sure to tailor your resumes and cover letters to each individual job that you apply to so that it highlights your relevant skills. Finally, stay organized. Keep a record of all the applications you have filled out and the dates for any upcoming interviews.",
