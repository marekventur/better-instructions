  "output": "Biodiversity is the variety of life forms in an ecosystem. This can include all species of plants and animals, their genetic makeup, the ecosystems and habitats in which they live, as well as the different roles and functions they perform. Biodiversity is essential to the survival of life on Earth, as it provides the resources necessary to support life, such as food, water and medicines. Additionally, diverse ecosystems are more resilient to climate change and provide a greater range of options for adaptation. Therefore, it is important to strive for conservation efforts that promote and protect biodiversity.",
