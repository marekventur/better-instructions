  "input": "\\<noinput>",
  "output": "As people age, the heart loses its ability to function effectively. The heart muscle begins to weaken, which increases the risk of heart disease and heart failure. The walls of the heart become less elastic and can stretch less as the heart pumps, and the heart may also become slightly enlarged. The heart also produces less energy and cannot contract as strongly as it did when it was younger. This can lead to fatigue, chest pain, irregular heart rhythms and a higher risk of stroke. Additionally, the arteries around the heart can become narrowed due to fatty deposits, and this can increase the risk of a heart attack.",
