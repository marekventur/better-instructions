AI is a branch of computer science that involves the study and development of intelligent machines and computer systems that can think for themselves and learn from their environment and experiences. AI systems can be programed to perform specific tasks and can interact with their environment to find solutions. This allows AI technology to move beyond simple rule-based systems and enables it to solve complex problems in more creative ways.",
