  "input": "",
  "output": "Observable behavior is what can be directly seen or heard, such as verbal or physical activity. Inferable behavior is what can be inferred from observed behavior, such as motives or intentions. Observable behavior can reveal a person's state of mind, emotions, level of functioning, and cognitive abilities. Inferable behavior can be used to make predictions, analyze patterns, and understand how an individual will respond in certain situations.",
