  "output": "The principle of least action states that the path taken between two points by a physical system is the one that requires the least amount of action. In other words, the path taken results in a net zero action between two points. This means that the action or energy is conserved over the duration of the path taken by the physical system. This principle has been used to explain the behavior of both light and sound waves in the natural world.",
