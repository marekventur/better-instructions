  "instruction": "How do bots detect humans?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Bots are able to detect humans by using a variety of techniques, including behavior analysis, CAPTCHA tests, and natural language processing. Behavior analysis relies on analyzing human behavior, such as mouse movements or keyboard strokes, to determine if a user is a human or a bot. CAPTCHA tests require users to input a code which only a human can read or decipher, making it difficult for bots to pass. Lastly, machines can use natural language processing to understand and interpret human language, enabling them to detect human users.",
