  "instruction": "Critique the following design concept.",
  "input": "The product is an interactive game for kids 8-12 years old, where they will learn about the world around them.",
  "output": "This is an interesting concept and the game could potentially be both engaging and educational for kids. However, I would suggest narrowing the target age range, as kids 8-12 years old may have very different interests and educational levels. Additionally, I would suggest adding more details about the game mechanics and features, such as how the game world is structured and what sort of interactivity the game will offer. Finally, I would also suggest gathering feedback from potential users in order to further refine and adjust the design.",
