No matter how long we have been apart, I still care about you and value our past friendship. \n\nI know that our differences were too great to overcome at the time, but I want to make peace with you and rebuild our friendship. If you are willing to give it another chance, I would love to reconnect with you and catch up. \n\nBest wishes,\n[Your name]",
