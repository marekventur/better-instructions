But something was different this day, something wasn\u2019t quite right. Unbeknownst to the townspeople, a small alien life form had crash-landed near the outskirts of town. \n\nThe alien, who called himself Sosso, was on a mission to explore new life forms and planets. After spending months in deep space, Sosso had finally found his way to Doncaster.\n\nAfter observing the townspeople, Sosso was fascinated by their kind and friendly nature. He admired their willingness to help each other and their devotion to the environment. Sosso soon made friends with the locals and they taught him all they knew.\n\nBut soon Sosso had to go back to his home planet. His mission had been a success and he was happy to share with his people everything he had learned and experienced in Doncaster. He said goodbye to his new friends with a heavy heart and promised to come back and visit some day.",
