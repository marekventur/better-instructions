  "instruction": "Lead a discussion on the Paris Agreement.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "I would begin the discussion by describing what the Paris Agreement is and its main goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement sets out a global plan for emissions reduction and encourages nations to set their own individual plans. I would then pose some questions to discuss, such as how countries are reducing emissions, how the Paris Agreement will affect those countries, if the Agreement is effective, and if any other actions need to be taken.",
