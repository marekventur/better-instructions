  "output": "The issue of plastic pollution in oceans is one of the biggest environmental concerns today. Over 8 million tons of plastic is dumped into the world\u2019s oceans each year, contaminating the aquatic ecosystem and damaging it in many ways. The plastic often breaks down into smaller pieces and is ingested by fish, seabirds and other wildlife, causing digestive tract blockages that can lead to starvation. The plastic also provides a home for disease-causing bacteria, leaching toxins and chemicals that can be passed along the food chain and up to humans. Plastics also affect tourism and marine recreation, as well as fishing, with discarded fishing gear entangling animals or clogging waterways. Plastic pollution is considered one of the most pressing problems of our time, and immediate action is needed to reduce its impact on our oceans.",
