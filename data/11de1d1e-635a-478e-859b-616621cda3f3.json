  "output": "The year 2040 has changed the world forever. Scientists invented artificial intelligence and robotics that can now do the work of a dozen people in half the time. Self-driving cars and flying drones are now commonplace and cities are now green oases compared to the pollution laden cities of the past. New medical opportunities, such as gene editing and cybernetic implants, and made life expectancy over 100 years. But not everyone is happy with the changes, as many once thriving jobs are now gone forever.",
