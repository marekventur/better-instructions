  "output": "I suggest a game that can be played by two to four people: it is a competitive game and the object is to be the first to build a tower of cards. All players are dealt a set of cards; each card has a number, letter, shape, or color. Players take turns adding a card to their own pile and can also steal a card from their opponents. The game ends when a player has successfully made a tower of five cards. The player who has the tower of five cards wins.",
