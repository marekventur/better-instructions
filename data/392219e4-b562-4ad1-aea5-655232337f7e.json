  "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. It starts with the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll, the main pigment in photosynthetic cells. The energy from the sunlight is used to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen ions, which are then used to turn carbon dioxide into a carbohydrate compound like glucose. This glucose is then used to provide the plant with the energy it needs to produce the building blocks of life, such as proteins and fats. Finally, the oxygen produced in photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere for other organisms to use.",
