  "instruction": "Explain why the resolution is important for a document.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The resolution of a document determines how crisp and clear the visuals, text, and other elements displayed in the document will look. Having a higher resolution ensures all elements are displayed with greater clarity and sharpness, making it easier to read information displayed in a document. Resolution is also important in order to ensure visuals appear as they should and that they use the least amount of memory resources. Lastly, resolution can affect the total file size of documents, which is important when sending them in emails or uploading them onto websites.",
