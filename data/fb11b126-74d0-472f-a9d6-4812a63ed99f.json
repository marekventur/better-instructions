  "input": "",
  "output": "Memory hierarchy is a concept in computer architecture that relates to the organization and access of data in a computer system. It is divided into various levels based on access speed and storage size. The levels of the hierarchy can be divided into primary, secondary and tertiary storage, with each level increasing in size but decreasing in speed of access. The concept of memory hierarchy is an important factor when designing computers as it seeks to optimize performance by using faster levels of storage for more important tasks and more cost-effective storage for less important tasks.",
