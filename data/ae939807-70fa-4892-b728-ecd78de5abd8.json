  "output": "The wind blew through the tall trees and a flock of birds flew overhead. Suddenly, one of the birds stumbled and fell to the ground. To the surprise of the other birds, it stood up on two legs, sprouted arms and legs, and began to walk - like a person. \n\nThe other birds all began to follow suit, transforming before the astonished eyes of the humans watching in the distance. It was a surreal sight as the formerly feathered animals took on more and more human features - speaking, walking, gesturing, laughing - and soon they were just as human-like as any person in the crowd.",
