  "input": "",
  "output": "The value of gold is so high primarily because of its scarcity, durability, and its widespread use in many industries. It is also considered a safe-haven asset in times of economic or geopolitical uncertainties. Gold is also often seen as a hedge against inflation, as its value typically increases in times when the value of a currency like the US dollar decreases.",
