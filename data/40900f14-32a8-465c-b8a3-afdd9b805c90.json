  "input": "",
  "output": "Getting a tattoo has several potential downsides. It is a permanent decision, so you should consider the design carefully and make sure it will not become an embarassment later in life. Tattoos can also be expensive and cause pain during the process. Additionally, some people might have an allergic reaction to ink and there is a risk of infection if the parlor isn't hygenically clean. Some workplaces may not accept applicants with visible tattoos, so it is important to research this aspect before getting a tattoo.",
