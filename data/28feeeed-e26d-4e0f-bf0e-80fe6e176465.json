  "output": "Creating a strategy to reduce waste generation starts with becoming mindful of how much waste we generate. Here are some strategies you can use to reduce waste: \n- Reduce the amount of single-use packaging you purchase by switching to items that can be reused or recycled. \n- Buy food in bulk, and bring your own reusable containers.\n- Reduce water waste by using efficient fixtures such as low-flow toilets and shower heads.\n- Compost food waste and yard waste.\n- Repair items instead of replacing them.\n- Recycle items that cannot be reused.\n- Reuse items such as shopping bags, containers, plastic bottles, and glass jars\n- Donate old clothes, appliances and furniture to those in need",
