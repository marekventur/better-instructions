  "input": "",
  "output": "British and American English have similarities and differences. For example, in British English, \u201ccolour\u201d is the preferred spelling, while in American English, \u201ccolor\u201d is preferred. British English also uses some different vocabulary words, such as \u201cchips\u201d instead of \u201cfries\". Grammar rules also differ between the two varieties, with American English having a more simplified version of some rules, such as the past perfect tense.",
