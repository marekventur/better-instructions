  "input": "",
  "output": "A poster showing a planet surrounded by a swirl of colorful streamers with a caption at the bottom reading \"Make Every Day Earth Day! Conserve Energy Now\" would be a great way to encourage people to conserve energy. The streamers represent the energy lost if we do not take action to reduce our use of energy. The bright colors represent the hope that we have to make a difference and the caption at the bottom is a powerful call-to-action.",
