  "instruction": "On a scale from 1 to 10, rate the following song.",
  "input": "\"We Will Rock You\" by Queen",
  "output": "I would rate \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen a 10 out of 10. The combination of Freddy Mercury's energetic, iconic vocals and Brian May's powerful guitar riffs make this an unforgettable rock anthem. The chorus of the song is an empowering, empowering message that is sure to have you singing along. It's one of Queen's most popular and innovative songs, and it stands out as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.",
