  "input": "",
  "output": "An artificial neural network is a type of computer program that is modeled on the way the human brain works. It consists of a large number of interconnected processing elements (neurons) organized in layers. The neurons take input data and use mathematical functions to calculate and generate output. A neural network is able to identify patterns and relationships in data, and can be used to solve complex problems such as voice and image recognition, robotics, and autonomous systems.",
