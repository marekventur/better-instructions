  "output": "Linear algebra is the study of linear equations and linear transformations. Linear equations are equations where the variables have a linear relationship with each other, and linear transformations are processes in which a vector or a matrix is transformed into another vector or matrix in a linear fashion. Linear algebra is used to solve systems of linear equations, which have applications in various fields such as engineering and economics.",
