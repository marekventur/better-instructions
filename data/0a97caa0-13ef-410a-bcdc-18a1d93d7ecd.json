  "input": "",
  "output": "A template engine is an integral part of software engineering. Templates are used to ensure consistency in design across multiple projects and platforms, and to minimize the amount of manual coding needed. Template engines allow developers to easily integrate existing HTML or CSS templates into a project, without having to write the code from scratch. In addition, they can also be used to help generate code by using a template as a starting point, which can then be customized as needed.",
