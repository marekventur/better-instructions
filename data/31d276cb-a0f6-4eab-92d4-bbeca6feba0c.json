  "input": "If x + y = 6 and xy = 8, what is the sum of x and y?",
  "output": "The sum of x and y is 14. This can be determined by solving the two equations given. In the first equation, one can solve for the y variable to get y = 6-x. This is then used to solve for x in the second equation, which yields x = 8/y. By substituting the value for y from the first equation, one can calculate that x = 2 and y = 4, giving us the sum of 6 + 4 = 14.",
