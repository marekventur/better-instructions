  "instruction": "Explain why a student should not run a GPT language model at scale on a laptop computer.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Running a GPT language model at scale on a laptop computer is not recommended due to the computational power it requires. GPT models use large neural networks that consume large amounts of memory and computing power. Running them on a laptop computer, which typically has limited computing power and memory, will likely cause significantly slower training and inference times. Additionally, running complex tasks on a laptop will severely deplete the battery, and may even cause your laptop to overheat. It is better to run a GPT model on a larger machine or in the cloud, where there is sufficient computing power and memory available.",
