  "output": "The coronavirus has had a major impact on the economy, causing disruptions in industries such as tourism, travel, hospitality, retail, and more. These industries have seen sharp decreases in activity, resulting in surging unemployment levels, a weakened stock market, and decreased consumer spending. Business closures have been rampant, and some companies have even been forced to permanently close their doors. As a result, fiscal and monetary policies have been embraced by governments to help stem the economic downturn.",
