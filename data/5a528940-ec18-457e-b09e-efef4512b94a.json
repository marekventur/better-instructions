  "output": "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that does not use labelled data. Unsupervised learning models are used for clustering data, uncovering patterns in data, and making predictions. Supervised learning, on the other hand, uses labelled data in order to make predictions. Supervised learning models are used to predict outcomes, classify data, and identify individual objects in data sets. In unsupervised learning, the model is just given a set of data and the algorithm looks for patterns in order to make decisions. In supervised learning, the model is given both the data and the labels, and it uses them to learn how to make predictions.",
