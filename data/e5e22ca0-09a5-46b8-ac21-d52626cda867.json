  "instruction": "Formulate a strategy for a client company that is looking to improve their website's SEO.",
  "input": "The client is a small business selling plumbing products online.",
  "output": "I suggest that the client's website should focus on improving their SEO by optimizing the content of the webpage to include relevant keywords, as well as improving their internal linking structure. Additionally they should focus on improving their back-linking strategies, involving creating engaging social media content and reaching out to other sites that could link to their page. The website should also continue to update and create new content, as this will help keep their rankings high and potentially drive more traffic to the page. Furthermore, they should keep track of their website's analytics and monitor their performance, as this will help inform their future SEO strategies.",
