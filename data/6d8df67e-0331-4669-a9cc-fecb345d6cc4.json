His life felt like a mountain of sadness and he didn\u2019t know how to climb his way out of it. Then, out of nowhere, a shiny unicorn appeared in front of him. \u201cI\u2019ll grant you one wish,\u201d said the magical creature. The giraffe smiled and said, \u201cplease make my life a box of chocolates now full of happiness\u201d. The unicorn nodded and with a wave of its sparkly horn, the giraffe\u2019s wish was granted and he was soon surrounded by a rainbow of joy!",
