  "output": "I once took initiative in developing a project for my company. I noticed a trend among our customers of repeated requests for a certain type of product and came up with a viable solution that would provide them with a better experience. I proposed the idea to my superiors and after being approved, I took it upon myself to develop the project from concept to finished product. I gathered the necessary resources and worked diligently to finish the project on time. In the end, the initiative I took resulted in a successful product launch.",
