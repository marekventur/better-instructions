  "instruction": "Explain how the ancient philosopher Plato's philosophy should be applied in the context of modern times.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Plato's philosophy can be applied to modern times in a variety of ways. One of the key elements of his philosophy is the idea of justice, which suggests that the world should be organized in such a way that those with the skills, resources, and interests necessary to benefit society can do so, for the good of all. This ideal can still be seen in many places today, where those with the skills and knowledge necessary to benefit society are encouraged to become leaders, innovators, and thinkers. In addition, Plato's notion of the \"Forms\" is still applicable today, where things like beauty, courage, and love can exist beyond physical boundaries and be found in people's souls. Finally, Plato's idea of knowledge being a collection of ideas that have been uncovered but never fully understood can be seen in modern times, as we continue to strive to uncover the mysteries of the universe.",
