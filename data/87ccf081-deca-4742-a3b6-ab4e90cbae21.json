  "output": "Enzymes are molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions in living cells. They work by lowering the energy barrier of a reaction, which allows the reaction to occur more quickly. Enzymes are highly specific and typically only catalyze one type of reaction. Moreover, they are able to bind with the substrates of the reaction, allowing the substrates to remain in close proximity and enhancing the rate of the reaction. Enzymes are essential for sustaining life as they catalyze the multitude of biochemical reactions that occur continuously in our cells.",
