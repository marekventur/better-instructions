  "input": "",
  "output": "Momentum is a measure of an object's tendency to move in a particular direction. It is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by its velocity. It is a conserved quantity, meaning that it does not change over time unless an external force acts to change it. Momentum is useful in describing an object's motion, as it tells us the direction in which the object is moving and how quickly it is accelerating.",
