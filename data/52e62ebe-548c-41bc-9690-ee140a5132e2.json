  "instruction": "Write a description of the life cycle of a dragonfly.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The life cycle of a dragonfly begins with eggs that are laid in or near water. After hatching, the larvae, or nymphs, will feed on other aquatic creatures such as small fish and insects. These larvae can live underwater for several years, before finally emerging to the surface and undergoing a process of metamorphosis, where they will emerge as a winged adult dragonfly. As an adult, dragonflies will feed on other flying insects, and will usually live only several weeks. At the end of their life, they will lay their own eggs, which will begin the cycle anew.",
