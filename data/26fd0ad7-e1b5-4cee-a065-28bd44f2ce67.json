  "output": "A melody for a song about nature could be a slow, peaceful rhythm. It could start with soft chords and gradually add in some higher notes to gradually build to a peak. Then the melody could resolve to some peaceful, calming sounds. Nature is full of life, energy and beauty and this can be captured and represented through the changes in tempo, dynamic and timbre. The melody could be reflective of nature's unpredictability and unpredictability and show appreciation for the beauty of the natural world.",
