  "input": "",
  "output": "Facial recognition systems can be improved by utilizing multi-step authentication processes and including safeguards against inaccuracies and false positives. Additionally, facial recognition systems should be user-driven, which allows users to verify or customize their recognition preferences. Further, facial recognition systems should employ measures against the collection and use of biometric data not limited to facial recognition. Moreover, facial recognition systems should be programmed with ethical standards and parameters for accuracy, fairness, and transparency.",
