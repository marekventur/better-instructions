  "input": "",
  "output": "The factors that affect the strength of a password include its length, complexity, randomness, and whether it contains any personally identifiable information. Longer passwords that are more random and complex are typically more secure. Additionally, passwords should never contain any information that could be used to identify an individual, such as their name, date of birth, address, etc.",
