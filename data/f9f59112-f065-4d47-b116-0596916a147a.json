  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a young man named Jake who lived in a small quiet town. He had always been a dreamer, imagining a life where he could be anything and do anything he wanted.\n\nOne night, as Jake lay in his bed, he heard a mysterious voice calling out his name. He looked around his bedroom, but there was no one there. Then he heard the voice again, begging him to follow it.\n\nFilled with curiosity and determination, Jake followed the voice, heading deeper and deeper into the forest. After what felt like hours of walking, he found himself in a clearing that seemed to shimmer in the moonlight. He heard the voice again, and it told him he had arrived at the wishing tree.\n\nJake gazed up at the ancient tree before him, and couldn't believe his eyes. The impossible had happened - it was a tree that grew coins, dollars, and even gems.\n\nUnable to believe his luck, Jake started filling his pockets with the precious items he found around the tree. But just as he was about to leave, a fierce creature stepped out of the darkness. \n\nJake scrambled away, only to find the creature had transformed into the mysterious voice he heard earlier. It turns out, the voice was actually a spell cast by an evil witch who was trying to trap people with her illusions. \n\nLuckily Jake was smart and brave, and he was able to outsmart the witch and escape with his life and treasures. From that day on, Jake's life was never the same again.",
