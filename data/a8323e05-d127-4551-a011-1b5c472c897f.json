  "input": "",
  "output": "The Law of Seven states that a customer needs to see or hear about something at least seven times before taking action. This is applicable to marketing and advertising as it suggests that an individual needs to be exposed to a company or product several times before they are likely to purchase. Developing a cohesive and consistent marketing message, which is seen and heard multiple times, is likely to increase the chances of consumers making a purchase. The Law of Seven suggests that even after a purchase, continued exposure to a brand can help build loyalty and encourage customers to continue using a product or service.",
