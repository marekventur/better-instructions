  "output": "Classical conditioning is a type of learning in which an organism comes to associate a certain stimulus with a certain response. For example, a dog might associate the sound of a bell with being given food, and subsequently salivate at the sound of the bell. Through classical conditioning, animals can learn to respond in certain ways to certain stimuli without being explicitly taught.",
