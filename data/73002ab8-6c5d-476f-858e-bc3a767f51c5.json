  "instruction": "Write an editorial advocating for more bike lanes in a city.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "As cities become more and more congested, bike lanes become a necessity for providing an efficient and safe transportation option for citizens. Bike lanes enhance the quality of life for all city dwellers by reducing air pollution, providing an alternative to traffic and eliminating the need for additional parking lots, which can be costly. Furthermore, installing bike lanes can create additional jobs in the city by employing construction workers and providing a financial boost to local businesses. Thus, governments should invest in bike lanes in order to encourage citizens to use bicycles as a mode of transportation and to reduce traffic, pollution and construction costs.",
