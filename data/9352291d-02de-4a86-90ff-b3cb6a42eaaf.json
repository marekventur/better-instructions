  "input": "",
  "output": "The three major forms of cell division are mitosis, meiosis, and binary fission. Mitosis results in two identical daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Meiosis results in four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell. Binary fission results in two daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.",
