  "instruction": "Describe the air circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The North Atlantic Ocean is dominated by the circulation of warm water from the tropics, which flows north along the east coast of North America, up across Greenland and the Arctic Ocean, and then back south via the Labrador Sea and Sargasso Sea. This circulation is known as the thermohaline circulation and contributes to moderate temperatures throughout the region. Additionally, the prevailing westerly winds of the North Atlantic Ocean have a strong influence on weather patterns in the area.",
