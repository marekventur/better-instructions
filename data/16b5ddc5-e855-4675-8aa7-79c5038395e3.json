  "output": "An interesting appetizer could be artichoke pesto crostini. To make it, slice some baguette into thin pieces and brush each piece with a mixture of olive oil and freshly squeezed lemon juice. Then top with a dollop of homemade pesto and a slice of canned artichoke heart. Toast in the oven until the crust is golden brown and the pesto is hot and bubbly.",
