  "output": "Keynesian economics is an economic approach developed by John Maynard Keynes that emphasizes the role of government intervention to stabilize a country's economy. It is based on the idea that government spending, taxation and monetary policy can be used to influence aggregate demand and stimulate economic growth. In contrast, traditional economics mainly focuses on markets and market forces as the primary determinants of economic outcomes. It proposes low taxes, limited government regulation, and less government spending as the most effective means of encouraging economic growth.",
