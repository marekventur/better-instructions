  "input": "",
  "output": "The simplest experiment to demonstrate Boyle's law is to fill an enclosed container, such as a balloon, with a gas and measure the pressure inside the container at different volumes. To perform the experiment, one would fill the container with gas, measure the pressure at different volumes, and then plot the data on a graph. This experiment should show that the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.",
