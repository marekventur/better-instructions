  "output": "He had the courage and strength of will,\nTo stand up and fight for what was right.\nHe spoke out its truth without fail,\nAnd let his voice pierce through the night.\n\nHe had a heart that was true and pure,\nHis actions given from from what was inside.\nBut his strength and courage were sublime,\nNever letting fear let his courage subside. \n\nHe took a stance and he never wavered,\nVoicing his opinion even if mislabeled.\nLetting his courage guide his path true,\nHe fought for what was right, through and through.",
