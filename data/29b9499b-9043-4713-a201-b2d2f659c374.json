  "input": "",
  "output": "When choosing a couch, you should consider the size, style, color, comfort, and durability. Be sure to measure the space where the couch will go, so you can choose the appropriate size. Think about the style of the room and choose a style of couch that will fit in with the rest of the decor. Choose a color that complements the other colors in the room. Make sure the couch is comfortable by sitting on it and checking how firm, soft, and supportive it is. And lastly, consider the durability, as you want the couch to last for as long as possible.",
