  "input": "",
  "output": "The current debate about humans and robots focuses primarily on automation, ethical concerns, and the potential for robots to displace humans in the workforce. Automation has allowed robots to become increasingly efficient, which has raised concerns about the future of human employment. On the ethical side, many are concerned about the extent to which robots may threaten human autonomy or control. Questions have also been raised about the implications of the widespread adoption of robots. For example, robot assistants may help create more convenient and efficient work environments, but this could come at the expense of employee autonomy and creativity. For these reasons, there is a growing debate about the roles that robots can and should play in society.",
