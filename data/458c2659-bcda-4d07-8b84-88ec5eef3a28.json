  "output": "A popular new way to use artificial intelligence in the classroom is with personalized learning. AI-driven platforms can be used to customize learning experiences by analyzing a student\u2019s progress, determining their strengths and weaknesses, and providing tailored lessons and activities to help them reach their goals. AI-driven platforms can also analyze a student\u2019s performance, providing educators with detailed feedback that can help them to identify areas of need and provide more effective instruction. Additionally, AI-driven tools can be used as tutors to provide students with real-time feedback as they complete their assignments. Finally, AI-powered systems can analyze large bodies of data to help educators develop new and more effective classroom practices.",
