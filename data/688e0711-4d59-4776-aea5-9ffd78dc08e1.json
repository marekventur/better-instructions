  "instruction": "Create a design for an eco-friendly house.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The design of an eco-friendly house should include a combination of elements that promote energy efficiency and healthy living. These features include:\n\n1. Insulated walls and roof to reduce the flow of thermal energy and prevent heat loss.\n2. Double or triple-glazed windows and doors to reduce heat loss.\n3. Solar photovoltaic and/or solar thermal panels to generate electricity.\n4. Rainwater collection systems to collect and reuse rainwater for irrigation and other purposes.\n5. Passive solar design principles to maximize natural sunlight and reduce energy needs.\n6. Natural cross-ventilation and proper insulation to reduce the need for cooling systems.\n7. Energy-efficient appliances such as LED lights, CFLs, and smart light bulbs.\n8. Recycled and natural materials for building, such as bamboo and recycled glass.\n9. Low-flow water fixtures to reduce water waste and promote conservation.",
