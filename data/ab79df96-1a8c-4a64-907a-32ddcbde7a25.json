  "input": "",
  "output": "The purpose of an air filter in an HVAC system is to remove dust, dirt, pollen, and other airborne particles from the air before it is distributed through the ventilation system. Air filters capture these particles, which helps to improve the indoor air quality and reduce the risk of allergies and respiratory illnesses. They also help to reduce the strain on the HVAC system, allowing it to run more efficiently.",
