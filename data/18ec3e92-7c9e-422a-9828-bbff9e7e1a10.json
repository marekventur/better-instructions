  "output": "My favorite character is Forrest Gump from the movie of the same name. He is a simple-minded but loyal, kind and courageous man who faces life's challenges with a positive attitude. He is an incredibly selfless person who loves unconditionally and strives to be his best no matter what the situation. He perseveres and shows true courage in life despite his mental disability, even though he often doesn't understand why he has to go through certain obstacles. He is an inspiration to us all.",
