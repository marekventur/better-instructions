  "instruction": "What is the difference between a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Neural Network?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised learning algorithms that can be used for classification and regression tasks. They use a subset of training data, known as support vectors, to create a decision boundary that is used to categorize new data points. Neural Networks are more general-purpose computing systems modeled after the human brain, consisting of interconnected \u201cneurons\u201d. The neurons are connected with weighted edges, which when adjusted can produce output when presented with input data. Neural networks are better suited for more complex tasks like natural language processing, while SVMs are better suited for simpler tasks like classification.",
