  "input": "",
  "output": "Fractional CO2 laser resurfacing is a type of skin resurfacing procedure that helps to reduce the signs of aging and improve the overall texture and appearance of the skin. The CO2 laser creates thousands of microscopic columns in the skin, which stimulates the production of collagen and other substances in the skin that are responsible for giving the skin a youthful appearance. The laser energy is delivered in a fractional manner, meaning only a certain percentage of the skin is targeted, while the surrounding area remains untouched. This promotes faster healing, as well as natural-looking results.",
