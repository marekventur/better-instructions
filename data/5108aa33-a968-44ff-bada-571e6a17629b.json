  "output": "The traditional publishing process typically involves the author submitting a manuscript to a publisher. The publisher then evaluates the manuscript for quality and potential marketability. If accepted, the publisher then edits the manuscript, designs a cover and works with the author to produce the book. Once ready, the publisher then markets and distributes the book to retailers and readers.",
