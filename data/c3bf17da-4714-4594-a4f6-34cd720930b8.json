  "output": "Immigration to the United States has both pros and cons. On the one hand, immigration brings a wide range of valuable skills, resources, and knowledge to the economy, strengthens the cultural diversity, and encourages a lively exchange of ideas. On the other hand, immigration can put pressure on public services, lead to overcrowding and greater competition for jobs, and could change the dynamics within certain cultural groups. Ultimately, becoming a nation of immigrants will strengthen the US, both economically and socially, provided that all immigrants are treated fairly and given an opportunity to fully participate in society.",
