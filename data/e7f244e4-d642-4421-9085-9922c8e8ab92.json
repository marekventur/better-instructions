  "input": "",
  "output": "Sublimation is a physical process where a solid converts directly to a gas, bypassing the liquid phase. Deposition is a physical process where a gas is converted directly to a solid. Both processes are endothermic, meaning they absorb heat energy from the environment. They differ in that sublimation requires a higher temperature than deposition for the phase transition to occur. Additionally, sublimation is typically restricted to certain substances, whereas deposition is a common phase transition for any gas to a solid.",
