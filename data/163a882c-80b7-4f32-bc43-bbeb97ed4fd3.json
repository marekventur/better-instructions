  "output": "I once showed kindness to someone by helping them in a time of need. I was walking down the street one day when I noticed a woman struggling to carry a large bag of groceries. She looked exhausted, and I immediately stopped to offer my help. I asked if I could carry the bag for her, and I was relieved when she accepted. I walked with her to her house, chatted with her a bit, and then I thanked her for letting me help her.",
