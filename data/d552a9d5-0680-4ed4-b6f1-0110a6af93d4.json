  "output": "An eco-friendly way to travel is to use public transportation. Taking public transportation such as a bus, train, or subway can help reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption. It is also generally cheaper than other forms of transportation and can often be quicker and more efficient. Additionally, using public transportation is more energy efficient than using your own car and can be a more convenient way to get around.",
