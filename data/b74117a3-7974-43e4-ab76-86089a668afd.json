  "input": "",
  "output": "I would like to include a feature in a fitness app that would allow users to create personalized workout routines. Users would be able to select the type of workouts they want to do, including strength training, cardio, HIIT and yoga. They would also be able to set a goal, such as losing weight or increasing strength, and the app would give them an optimal exercise program to reach that goal. To make the feature even more useful, users would have the option to track their progress over time.",
