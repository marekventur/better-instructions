  "output": "Software engineering is the use of engineering techniques to develop software in a systematic, efficient and reliable way. This process involves a wide variety of tools and techniques to ensure reliable, secure and efficient software products. Common tools and techniques used in software engineering include requirements gathering, system planning, modeling, design, coding, testing, deployment, security, and maintenance. Each one of these tools and techniques, when applied appropriately and in combination, can result in the development of robust and reliable software products. Additionally, the use of software engineering principles can ensure that software is created in an efficient, secure and reliable way.",
