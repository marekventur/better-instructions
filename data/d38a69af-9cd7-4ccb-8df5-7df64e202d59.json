  "output": "The major themes in Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus Rex are those of fate, hubris, and individual responsibility. Oedipus is a classic tragic hero who suffers a great downfall due to his hubris, or excessive pride. He is determined to solve the riddle of his own identity, despite warnings from oracles, and in so doing, discovers he has unknowingly fulfilled a terrible prophecy. His journey of discovery illuminates the concept of fate being at work in the lives of mortals and shows the danger of disregarding the gods\u2019 will. Oedipus\u2019 journey also serves as a reminder that each person is responsible for their own actions and must face the consequences of their decisions.",
