  "instruction": "Describe an alien creature in a sci-fi movie.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The alien creature was a massive, insect-like creature with green, scaly skin, six legs and a long, pair of curved antennae emerging from its head. Its face was dominated by two dark, lidless eyes that seemed to constantly scan its surroundings. It had two large, veined wings that were strong enough to propel it through the air at high speeds, and a long, segmented tail that thrashed about wildly as it moved. Its long claws were razor-sharp, and its powerful jaws could pulverize anything it encountered.",
