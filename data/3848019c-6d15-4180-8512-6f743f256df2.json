  "input": "",
  "output": "Technology can make job searching much easier and more efficient by providing tools to automate the process of finding, organizing, and appying to jobs. For instance, digital job boards such as Indeed allow users to search and apply to job postings in an organized manner, while algorithms can be used to match job seekers with relevant job postings. Furthermore, social media platforms can help job seekers build a professional network which can in turn lead to more job opportunities.",
