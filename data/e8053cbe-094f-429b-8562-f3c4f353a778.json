  "input": "",
  "output": "One creative solution to the problem of rising dropout rates in my school or community is to create a youth mentoring program. This program would pair mentors with at-risk youth in order to provide consistent guidance and support. The mentors could help with goal-setting, provide academic assistance, and serve as role models that the youth can look up to. The mentors should also have a deep understanding of the issues and challenges that their mentee faces, so they can better help them navigate through difficult times. In addition, mentors could provide career coaching and help students apply for internships and jobs in their desired industry.",
