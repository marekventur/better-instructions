Aerobic exercise should be done at least three times a week and should consist of exercises such as jogging, running, cycling, and swimming. Strength training should also be done at least three times a week, using weights, resistance bands, or body weight exercises. It is also important to eat a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats. Finally, make sure to give your body adequate rest and recovery. Make sure to stretch before and after workouts and get at least 7-8 hours of sleep every night.",
