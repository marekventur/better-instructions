  "instruction": "Explain why boiling water freezes faster than cold water",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Boiling water freezes faster than cold water because the process of boiling causes tiny air bubbles to form which makes it easier for the water to freeze quickly. A phenomenon known as \"supercooling\" allows liquid water to stay liquid below freezing temperatures until it is disturbed. The presence of these tiny air bubbles allows the water to freeze more quickly.",
