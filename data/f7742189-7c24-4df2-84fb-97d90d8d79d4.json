  "output": "When citing a source in a paper, it is important to follow the author-date system. This means that the author\u2019s last name, year of publication, and page number of the source should be in parentheses at the end of the relevant sentence. The first time a source is cited, a full citation should be provided in the reference list. Subsequent citations of the same source should only include the author's last name and the year of publication. For example: (Smith, 2020).",
