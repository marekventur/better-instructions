  "input": "",
  "output": "Neural networks have several advantages over traditional predictive analytics methods such as linear regression. Neural networks are more capable of capturing complex data patterns, enabling them to make more accurate predictions. Additionally, neural networks can process large volumes of data better than traditional methods and can accommodate more diverse sources of data, such as images and text. Furthermore, neural networks are capable of adapting to changes in data patterns, making them more robust and reliable for long-term predictions.",
