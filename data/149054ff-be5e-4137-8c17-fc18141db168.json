  "output": "I recently watched the movie Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-Ho, and I was absolutely blown away. This movie is a masterful blend of genres\u2014it's both a black comedy and a commentary on classism, with a twist ending that no one could see coming. The acting is fantastic, particularly Song Kang-ho as the head of the poor household, and the cinematography is stunning. The movie has a perfect balance of humor and thought-provoking drama, and it will leave you talking about the ending for days afterwards. Overall, I highly recommend Parasite; it is an exceptional movie and an experience you won't soon forget.",
