  "input": "Too many people have access to a shared office space, so it is always noisy and distracting.",
  "output": "One creative way to solve the problem is to create a soundproof booth or office within the shared space. This will minimize the noise and provide a space for those who need to work in a quiet environment. It can be equipped with audio dampening materials and may even include noise cancelling headphones to make it even more effective.",
