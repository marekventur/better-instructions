  "output": "A healthy meal for a college student could consist of grilled chicken with a side of steamed broccoli, roasted sweet potatoes, and a side salad. To add a bit of flavor, the chicken could be seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper and some garlic powder. The broccoli can be topped with a bit of olive oil and some parmesan cheese. The sweet potatoes can be drizzled with a bit of honey and topped with fresh herbs. The salad can be accompanied with a vinaigrette of your choice.",
