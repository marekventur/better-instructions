  "input": "The man had bought a horse but the horse wasn't good",
  "output": "The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct sentence should be \"The man had bought a horse, but the horse was not good\". The mistake is the use of \"wasn't\" instead of \"was not\". This is incorrect because \"wasn't\" is the incorrect form of \"was not\".",
