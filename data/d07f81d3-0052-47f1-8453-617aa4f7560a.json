  "output": "A chemical reaction is the process of transforming one set of molecules into another. During a chemical reaction, bonds between atoms are broken, and new bonds are formed to produce different molecules or chemical compounds. The form and properties of these new molecules are often very different from the original ones, as chemical reactions can involve changes in color, temperature, or even the production of gases or light.",
