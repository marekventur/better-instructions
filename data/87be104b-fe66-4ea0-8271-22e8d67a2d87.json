  "input": "",
  "output": "Quarks are particles that make up protons and neutrons. They possess three properties: colour charge, spin, and mass (or their respective antiparticles). Colour charge determines how quarks interact with the strong nuclear force to form atomic nuclei, whereas spin contributes to atomic stability. Mass, which is much smaller than that of protons and neutrons, influences the probability of how quarks interact with one another.",
