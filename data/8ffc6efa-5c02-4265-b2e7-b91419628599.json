  "output": "At 5 pm on June 12th, the weather was warm, with temperatures in the mid 70s Fahrenheit and clear skies. The sun had started to set, leaving a beautiful orange and red sky in its wake. A light breeze stirred the trees and grasses and provided a pleasant relief from the sunny day. There were occasional clouds, but they were white and lightly spread across the sky.",
