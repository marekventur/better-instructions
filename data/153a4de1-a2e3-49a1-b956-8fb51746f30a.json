  "output": "The most impressive aspect of the pyramids of Giza is how well they have stood the test of time. The pyramids are estimated to be over 4500 years old and still stand as some of the most impressive structures ever built. The largest of the three pyramids, the Great Pyramid, was originally 146.7 meters tall and is estimated to have weighed 6 million metric tons at its peak. This is a testament to the advanced engineering, planning, and construction skills possessed by the ancient Egyptians.",
