  "input": "",
  "output": "Driving in rain requires extra attention and caution. Be sure to slow down and increase your following distance from the car ahead of you to give yourself more time to stop. Turn on your headlights to increase visibility. Avoid making sudden turns, rapid stops and acceleration. Stay in the far right lane if possible, and avoid puddles as much as possible as they can impair visibility and increase the possibility of hydroplaning. Make sure your windshield wipers are in good condition and check your tires for proper air pressure. Finally, be aware of your surroundings, such as other cars in your vicinity and the road conditions.",
