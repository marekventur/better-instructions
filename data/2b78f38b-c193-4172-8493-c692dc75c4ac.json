  "instruction": "Propose a hypothesis on why the population of this species is declining",
  "input": "Lemurs",
  "output": "My hypothesis is that the population of lemurs is declining due to deforestation and habitat destruction in their native regions of Madagascar. This destruction leads to reduced access to food sources, making it difficult for lemurs to survive. Additionally, the rapidly changing climate may be negatively impacting their breeding and survival as well.",
