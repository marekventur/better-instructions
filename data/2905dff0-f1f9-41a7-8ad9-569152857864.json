  "output": "Social networking and blogging are both methods of communication and sharing information online, however they differ in a number of ways. Social networking typically focuses on sharing short posts with others, as well as connecting with friends and family. Blogging on the other hand is typically more in depth and focuses on writing lengthy articles about certain topics or areas of interest. Furthermore, blogging is typically more focused on the writing and has a more organized content structure than social networking.",
