  "output": "Sometimes a person should trust their gut instinct when faced with a difficult decision. For instance, if you are considering a job offer but something doesn't feel right, it might be best to trust your inner voice. Your instinct may be telling you that the job isn't a great fit, or that it won't lead to the career satisfaction you're looking for. It's important to assess the pros and cons of the situation, and to be mindful of any warning signs you may sense.",
