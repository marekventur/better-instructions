  "input": "",
  "output": "A solution to the problem of homelessness would be to create more affordable housing in every city. Housing is one of the main factors that contribute to homelessness, so making it more attainable would go a long way towards helping people in need. Additionally, providing homeless people with resources such as job training, access to mental health services, and substance use treatment will help them stabilize their lives and get them back on their feet. By creating more affordable housing and providing necessary resources, we can take steps to reduce and eventually eliminate homelessness.",
