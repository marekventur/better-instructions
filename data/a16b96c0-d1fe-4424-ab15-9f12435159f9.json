  "output": "1. To ride a skate is where I'd like to go,\nIt zooms past skiers, 'cause I'm so pro.\n2. The skateboarding ramp seemed so tall,\nBut I made it over with no stall.\n3. I take a ride on my trusty skate,\nAnd carve the roads with a twist of fate.\n4. I spin around the rink so full,\nCheck me out, I'm lookin' cool.\n5. You don't believe I can skate on the sand,\nBut watch me do it with a little hand!\n6. Skateboard's my name and it's my game,\nMy moves are pretty, so don't feel ashamed.",
