  "output": "The debate about global warming is centered on whether or not human activities are contributing to it. Proponents of the anthropogenic view maintain that human activities like burning of fossil fuels, industrial emissions, and deforestation are directly responsible for the phenomenon, while the naturalists maintain that it is entirely due to natural forces. The debate has been fueled by analyses of temperature records, satellite observations, computer models, and a wide range of evidence.",
