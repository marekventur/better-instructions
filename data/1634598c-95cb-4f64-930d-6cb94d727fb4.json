  "input": "Robot arm",
  "output": "To construct a robot arm, you will need to first think about what components you will need to build it and how they will fit together. You will need to determine which parts of the robot arm will be motorized, how many motors will be necessary, and how they should be wired to the robot arm's control electronics. Next, you will need to create a frame and attach the motors to it. After that, you will need to program the motors with the desired movement functions. Finally, you can assemble the rest of the robot arm and securely attach it to the frame.",
