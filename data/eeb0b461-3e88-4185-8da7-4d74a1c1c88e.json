  "output": "Once upon a time, deep in the jungle, there lived a lion called Larry. He was a friendly lion who enjoyed playing games and spending time with other animals in the jungle. Everyone in the jungle loved Larry, but the other animals were usually scared of him because he was a lion. One day, Larry met a tiny mouse and they instantly became good friends. They went on many adventures together, helping each other explore the jungle and discovering all the great things the jungle had to offer. \n\nFrom then on, Larry and the mouse were always seen in the jungle, either playing games or just enjoying each other's company. They were the best of friends, and no matter how scary the situation, Larry was always there to help. Larry became a beacon of friendship and kindness in the jungle, showing that all animals, no matter how big or small, can be friends.",
