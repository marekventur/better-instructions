  "output": "The narwhal is an amazing animal. It is a species of toothed whale that is the sole member of the Monodontidae family and can be found in the cold Arctic ocean waters. It is noted for its long and straight helical tusk, made of ivory which can be up to 3 meters long. The narwhal can dive to depths of up to 1.5 km in search of prey, using its sensitive hearing and echolocation for navigation. It is also known for its unique \"clicking\" and \"whistling\" sounds which it uses for communicating.",
