  "input": "",
  "output": "Credit scores are important because they provide lenders with a measure of how likely a borrower is to repay a loan. They are based on borrowers\u2019 past credit histories, and serve as a measure of creditworthiness. A good credit score can open up access to loans and other forms of credit, while a low score can make it difficult or impossible to obtain credit. This makes it important to keep track of one's credit score and maintain a positive credit history.",
