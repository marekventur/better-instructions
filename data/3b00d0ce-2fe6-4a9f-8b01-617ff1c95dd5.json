  "input": "",
  "output": "Two ways to increase website conversions include optimizing the layout of the website and reducing the number of steps required to complete a purchase. Optimizing the website layout means making sure the navigation is intuitive, the page design is eye-catching, and any out-of-date content is updated. Reducing the number of steps to complete a purchase may include streamlining the checkout process and offering different payment options. Additionally, providing relevant and timely customer service to answer any questions or alleviate any concerns prospective buyers may have can also help increase website conversions.",
