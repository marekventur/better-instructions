  "input": "",
  "output": "The key difference between the cash flow statement and the income statement is that the cash flow statement focuses on actual cash movements in and out of a business, whereas the income statement provides a more detailed account of profits and losses over a period of time. Specifically, the cash flow statement examines sources and uses of cash, while the income statement looks at revenues earned, expenses incurred, and ultimately net income earned over a period of time.",
