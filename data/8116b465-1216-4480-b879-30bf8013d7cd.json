  "output": "Technology is enabling us to explore the intersections of biology and technology, such as how we can make use of gene editing for the purpose of disease prevention. It's also giving us the ability to control our own biology and physiology, through medicines and devices like pacemakers. Finally, technology is helping us to understand the complexity of biology, with the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning by gathering data and finding patterns in the data.",
