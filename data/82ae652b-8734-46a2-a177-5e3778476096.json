  "output": "Gravity is a fundamental force in nature which affects not only our bodies, but every living organism and non-living thing around us. In our daily lives, it keeps us on the ground, provides the resistance we need to move objects, and facilitates the flow of liquids and gases from place to place. Finally, it is the reason why the earth and other planets are able to sustain their orbits and revolve around the sun.",
