  "input": "",
  "output": "This game could involve a character running around a virtual world filled with obstacles. The obstacles could be made up of various two-dimensional shapes such as triangles, squares, circles, and rectangles. The goal would be for the character to successfully navigate the obstacles and reach the end of the level. As the player progresses, the difficulty level could be changed by increasing the size and number of the shapes. Additionally, there could be a few levels where players must manipulate the shapes in order to complete the level. This would teach children to recognize the shapes and how they can be combined into a whole.",
