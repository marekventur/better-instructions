  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to use technology to reduce waste is to move towards a circular economy model. This involves using digital technologies such as sensors and analytics to track the usage of resources in order to identify areas of potential waste. Companies can then take steps such as reusing and recycling materials, as well as making better use of resources in order to reduce the waste created.",
