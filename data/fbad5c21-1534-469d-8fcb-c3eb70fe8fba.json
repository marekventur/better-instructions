  "instruction": "Explain why carbon dioxide is a major contributor to climate change.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to climate change because it is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is released when fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas are burned. As the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, more heat is trapped, leading to higher temperatures on the Earth's surface. The increased temperature leads to more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and an overall alteration of the Earth's climate system.",
