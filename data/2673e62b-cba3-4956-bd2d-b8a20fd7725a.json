  "input": "",
  "output": "Augmented reality can be used to improve everyday life in many creative ways. For example, a person could use it to get reminders throughout their day that are linked to their physical environment. For instance, when they walk by their fridge they could receive a notification reminding them to pick up groceries. Other reminders could include notifications when they get close to the store they need to go to, or when they walk into the classroom where their next lecture is taking place.\n\nIn addition, augmented reality can be used for entertainment purposes. A person could use it to play augmented reality video games that overlay onto their physical environment. Or if they're into outdoor activities, they could set up an outdoor obstacle course that they can complete with the help of virtual markers in their environment. \n\nFurthermore, augmented reality can be used to help with interior design. A person could visualize what a piece of furniture would look like in their home, or they could visualize how a painting or tapestry would look on their wall. \n\nOverall, augmented reality can be used to make life more enjoyable, more efficient, and more creative.",
