  "input": "noinput",
  "output": "Three strategies for managing stress include regular exercise, relaxation techniques, and healthy lifestyle choices. Exercise can help reduce stress levels by releasing endorphins, which are natural chemicals that reduce stress and improve mood. Relaxation techniques such as mindfulness, deep breathing, and yoga can help reduce stress levels. Healthy lifestyle choices such as getting adequate sleep, eating healthy, and avoiding alcohol and drugs can also help manage stress levels.",
