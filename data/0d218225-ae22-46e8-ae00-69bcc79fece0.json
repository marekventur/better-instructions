  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Collect samples of speech from the conversation partner.\n2. Analyze the contents of each sample to identify the language's phonological features and other characteristics.\n3. Use machine learning techniques to identify the language of the sample.\n4. Compare the language identified from the sample to the languages of the conversation partner's native country.\n5. If the language identified from the sample matches a language of the conversation partner's native country, then classify the sample as the conversation partner's native language.",
