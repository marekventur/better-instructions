  "input": "No Input",
  "output": "Practicing self care is important because it can help to improve overall physical and mental health and wellbeing. When you practice self care, you are taking time out for yourself to de-stress, to relax, and to focus on activities that make you feel good, such as spending time with friends, reading a book, going for a walk, or just taking a few moments to yourself. Self care is a way to boost energy levels and make sure you are in the best shape to take on life's challenges and opportunities. It's also essential for developing a positive attitude and outlook, and for avoiding burnout and stress.",
