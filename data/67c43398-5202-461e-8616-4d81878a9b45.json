  "instruction": "Research and describe the structure of a Jupiter-like planet.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Jupiter-like planets have large atmospheres composed of hydrogen and helium and can be hot or cold depending on their distance from the star. They have no defined surface and consist mostly of gas and liquid. The bulk of the planet is composed of an outer layer of hydrogen and an inner core of higher density material. Hotter planets may have water clouds and potential for life, whereas colder planets may have frozen ammonia and methane clouds, and have much thinner atmospheres than the hot planets.",
