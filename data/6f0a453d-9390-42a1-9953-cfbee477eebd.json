  "input": "",
  "output": "A for loop in Java is written as follows: \n\nfor (initialization; condition; update) {\n    statement(s);\n}\n\nThe initialization expression initializes the loop; it is executed only once at the start of the loop. The condition is evaluated on each iteration of the loop, and if it is true, the statement(s) are executed; if it is false, the loop terminates. The update expression is evaluated on each iteration, and can be used to update the loop variable.",
