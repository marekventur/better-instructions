  "output": "One method for detecting spam emails is to use a machine learning model that is trained on examples of known spam emails. The model can then analyze new emails for patterns that are indicative of spam emails, such as the presence of certain keywords. Additionally, filters can be used to block emails from suspicious senders and detect emails with suspicious content.",
