  "output": "Two ways to improve user experience when using a website are to ensure the website is optimized for mobile devices, and to develop interactive and engaging content. \n\nOptimizing a website for mobile devices will ensure all users, regardless of the device they are accessing the website with, are able to view and use the website with a pleasant experience.\n\nInteractive and engaging content encourages user interaction, which in turn can increase website visits and loyalty. Content can include polls and quizzes, video content, user forums and chat bots, etc. which are designed to engage users and allow them to become comfortable using the website.",
