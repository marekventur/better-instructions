  "instruction": "Compare and contrast geometric and arithmetic progressions.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Both geometric and arithmetic progressions are series of numbers that follow a certain pattern. In an Arithmetic Progression (AP), each term is found by adding a constant value to the previous term. On the other hand, in a Geometric Progression (GP), each term is found by multiplying the previous term by constant value. While an AP involves the addition of numbers, a GP involves the multiplication of numbers. Additionally, the sum of terms in an AP over time will approach infinity, while the sum of terms in a GP will eventually settle at a fixed value.",
