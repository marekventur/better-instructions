  "input": "",
  "output": "The relationship between clouds and air temperature is a complex one, but in general, clouds can play a significant role in regulating the temperature at Earth\u2019s surface. In some situations, clouds can insulate the surface and trap warm air near the ground, raising the temperature. While in other situations, low-lying clouds can reflect incoming solar radiation back into space and cool the surface. Furthermore, clouds act as part of the Earth's energy balance by moderating the amount of radiation that escapes back into space.",
