  "output": "The main challenges associated with tracking progress in a remote team are communication and accountability. Without being able to observe the team members in person, it can be difficult to ensure that information and instructions are being communicated properly and that everyone is on track with their tasks. Additionally, it can be difficult to ensure that team members are held accountable for their work and that they are making progress towards their goals. Lastly, there is the challenge of keeping team members motivated toward their objectives, which can be difficult when there is limited face-to-face contact.",
