  "input": "",
  "output": "Friction is beneficial in everyday life, especially when it comes to healthcare. Take, for instance, the use of friction rubs in physical therapy. When physical therapists apply friction rubs to sore muscles, they create a small amount of heat and friction. This helps to increase circulation to the area, reduce inflammation, and promote healing by improving tissue mobility.",
