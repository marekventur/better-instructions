  "output": "The characters of Great Expectations are mainly Pip, Joe Gargery, Miss Havisham, Estella, Abel Magwitch, and Herbert Pocket. Each of these characters has distinct personalities and experiences life-changing events from which they learn lessons. Pip, for example, starts as an innocent, lonely orphan and learns the important truth that establishing deep meaningful relationships is essential for personal growth. Joe is a strong, protective, and humble character who teaches Pip the importance of empathy despite difficult circumstances. Miss Havisham, the wealthy eccentric widow, uses Estella to punish men for the hurt her own heart has endured. Estella is a cold and beautiful young woman who learns life\u2019s hard lessons from her adoptive mother with a tragic outcome. Abel Magwitch, an escaped convict, changes Pip\u2019s life by giving him the mysterious means to fulfill his dreams. Lastly, Herbert Pocket is Pip\u2019s loyal friend and confidant who shows him the importance of friendship, loyalty, and responsibility.",
