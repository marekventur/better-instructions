  "input": "- current healthcare protocols\n- potential future protocols",
  "output": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the safety of healthcare workers is becoming increasingly important. Healthcare workers are the backbone of healthcare systems around the world and they are on the front lines of providing care to patients. For their safety, healthcare providers must adhere to current protocols and best practices when interacting with patients and their families during the pandemic. \n\nCurrent protocols for healthcare safety include frequent handwashing, wearing masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE), practicing physical distancing, and disinfecting surfaces regularly. It is also important to ensure that any visiting family members or friends wear a mask, observe physical distancing, and wash their hands often. \n\nTo keep healthcare workers safe during the pandemic, healthcare systems should consider implementing potential future protocols such as screening visitors upon arrival, requiring all visitors to wear masks (and other PPEs, if appropriate) and providing skin care and ventilation guidelines in order to reduce the risk of virus spread. In addition, healthcare institutions can provide online forms for visitors to fill out before entering the facility. \n\nOverall, to keep healthcare workers safe during the pandemic, healthcare systems must stay up to date on current and emerging protocols in order to curb virus spread and protect their staff. By staying vigilant and taking extra steps to protect their workers, healthcare providers can remain healthy and continue to provide quality care to their patients.",
