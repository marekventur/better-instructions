  "output": "One strength of GPT-3 is its scalability and flexibility. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, from text generation to question-answering and semantic similarity tasks, as well as for more complex tasks such as machine reading comprehension. It is also highly tunable, allowing users to quickly adjust the model to better fit their data and tasks.\n\nOne limitation of GPT-3 is that it still relies heavily on human-provided context. Although GPT-3 can be trained on multiple sources of data and contexts, the model still needs input from humans to correctly identify and prioritize task-specific parameters.",
