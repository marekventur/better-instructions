  "input": "",
  "output": "If your computer freezes, the first thing to do is to check if the mouse and keyboard are still working. If they are not, try disconnecting them and then reconnecting them. If that does not work, try a hard reboot by holding down the power button for 5 seconds. If the issue persists, contact customer support or an IT technician for further help.",
