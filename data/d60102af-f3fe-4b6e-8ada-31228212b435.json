  "output": "It stared ominously out of the darkness, its sinister eyes cutting through the gloom of the night. As I cautiously walked towards it, my heart pounding with fear, I noticed it seemed to be watching, waiting for me. A howl of terror escaped my lips as it started to move, and I barely had time to realise what was happening as it made a beeline for me.\n\nI ran, faster and faster, screaming with terror as I heard it gaining on me. I could feel it hot on my heels, its breath close behind, and I prayed I would make it out alive. But alas, it was not to be-just as I was about to reach safety I felt its powerful jaws clamping down firmly on my shoulder, like a vice. All I could do now was pray I would survive the night.",
