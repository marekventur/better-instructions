  "output": "The night sky is full of stars \nGlimmering bright, near and far\nShining above in a glorious sight\nA wondrous array, never so bright\n\nComets soaring, a peaceful grace\nGazing up in amazement at this hidden place\nSeeing far off and unknown things\nIn the constellation's distant rings\n\nThe stars have watched many stories unfold\nSparking imaginations we can only behold\nFilled with the promise of a future untold\nWhat beauty and wonders it may behold.",
