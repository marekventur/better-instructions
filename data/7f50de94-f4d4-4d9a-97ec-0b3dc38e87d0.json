  "output": "Global warming is the long-term warming of the Earth\u2019s climate due to human activities that increase certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane. These gases trap heat, causing the average global surface temperature to increase. This disruption of the Earth\u2019s natural balance is known as the greenhouse effect, because it is the same as what happens when heat is trapped by the glass of a greenhouse. The effects of global warming can be seen in rising sea levels, melting polar icecaps, and more frequent and intense extreme weather events.",
