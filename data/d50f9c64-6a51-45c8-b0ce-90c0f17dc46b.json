  "output": "It was the middle of winter and a fierce snowstorm had rolled in, trapping the small town in a blizzard. Everyone had seen it coming and had quickly gone into their homes to hunker down and wait out the storm. No one dared venture out into the howling wind and the thick blanket of snow, except for one man. He was seen trudging through the snow, putting one foot in front of the other until he was lost in the darkness. No one knew why he was walking in such a terrible storm, but they remained in their homes, huddled around their fires, as he slowly made his way out of town.",
