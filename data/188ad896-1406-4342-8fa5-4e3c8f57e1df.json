  "input": "",
  "output": "\"Starry Night\" by Dutch post-Impressionist painter Vincent Van Gogh is an oil painting featuring a night sky full of stars and a sleepy village on the horizon. The night sky is painted in swirling blues and yellows, with a crescent moon and stars that twinkle in the dark night. In the village, church spires and a large cypress tree draw the eye. The painting is full of movement, capturing the hustle and bustle of a small village, while the sky is peaceful and still. The painting is seen as a representation of Van Gogh's inner peace and spirituality.",
