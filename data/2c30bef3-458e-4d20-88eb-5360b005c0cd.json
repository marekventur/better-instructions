  "instruction": "Design an experiment to test if artificial intelligence can improve medical diagnosis accuracy.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The experiment would involve sourcing a dataset of medical records with known diagnoses and symptoms. A supervised learning algorithm would be trained to use the dataset to classify cases. The trained algorithm would then be tested on a separate dataset of medical cases with known diagnoses to compare the accuracy of the AI model against an experienced medical professional.",
