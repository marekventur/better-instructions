  "output": "Public and private schools have many of the same features, such as providing quality education to their students and qualified teachers who are dedicated to helping them learn. However, there are also some important differences between the two. Public schools are funded by the state, while private schools are funded by tuition fees and donations. Public schools are required to adhere to certain state-mandated curriculums, while private schools may be able to choose their own curriculums. Public schools tend to be more cost-effective than private schools, while private schools may be able to offer more specialized courses or extracurricular activities.",
