  "output": "The world is filled with beauty of nature,\nA moonlit sky so dimly lit,\nFlowers so vibrant, petals of coral,\nPlaying in tune with the night's gentle hymn.\n\nThe sun shines bright, illuminating the trees,\nFruits of labor, fresh and sweet,\nChirping birds, their joyous notes soaring,\nAll senses enlivened beyond belief.\n\nThe stars and galaxies, a tapestry of light,\nMysteries yet to be unraveled and unveiled,\nGracefully flowing streams, cascading water\nMy love for nature will never be concealed.",
