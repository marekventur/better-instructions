  "input": "The government is debating whether or not to raise taxes on cigarettes",
  "output": "Raising taxes on cigarettes will positively affect public health. The higher cost of cigarettes will make it harder for younger people to afford them, which will lead to a decrease in the number of young smokers. In addition, the additional tax money generated can be used to fund stop-smoking initiatives and research into effective treatments against smoking-related diseases.",
