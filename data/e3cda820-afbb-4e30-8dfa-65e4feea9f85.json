  "output": "The Turing Test is a method of determining a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour indistinguishable from that of a human. The test involves an interrogator who is attempting to differentiate between a machine and a human based on a conversation. If the interrogator is unable to tell the difference between the machine's responses and a human's responses, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.",
