  "output": "Once upon a time a love was born,\nA feeling deep inside that stirred and shone.\nTwo hearts forever it might adorn,\nAs love knows no bounds, not even time nor morn.\n\nTender moments spent in arms entwined,\nMemories shared, laughter and cries.\nA love whose beauty transcends what's defined,\nWhere once felt cold, now warmth supplies.\n\nShe said, 'He, my love, I will never part,\nYour love has warmed my frozen heart.'\nHe replied, 'I'll be with you forever, my sweetheart.'\n\nThis tender love will always be here,\nA flame that can never disappear. \nThough worlds may part and skies may tear,\nOur love will remain, a bond made ever so clear.",
