  "instruction": "Find the transformation needed for the following equation.",
  "input": "2x + 3y = 8",
  "output": "To solve for x and y, subtract 3y from both sides and then divide both sides by 2. This gives x = (8 - 3y)/2. Substitute this expression into the original equation and solve for y. This gives y = (8 - 2x)/3. Hence, the transformation needed is y = (8 - 2x)/3.",
