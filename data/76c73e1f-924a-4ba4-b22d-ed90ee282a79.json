  "output": "1. Smoking does not cause cancer \u2013 In reality, smoking causes about 90% of lung cancer cases and causes other cancers, heart disease and stroke as well.\n\n2. Smoking is not as bad as it used to be \u2013 Cigarettes today contain more nicotine and other chemicals than they did a few decades ago, meaning they are more addictive and more harmful to your health.\n\n3. Light cigarettes are safer \u2013 Light cigarettes still contain the same amount of nicotine and other harmful chemicals as regular cigarettes, so they are equally as dangerous.\n\n4. Smokeless tobacco is less hazardous than cigarettes \u2013 Smokeless tobacco is still addictive, contains many carcinogens, and can lead to oral cancer.\n\n5. People will eventually quit smoking eventually \u2013 Many people think that if you smoke long enough, you will eventually be able to quit on your own. In reality, this is not the case; most people need help quitting or switching to other forms of nicotine products.",
