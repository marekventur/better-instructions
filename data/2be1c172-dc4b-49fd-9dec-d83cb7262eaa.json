  "instruction": "Describe the differences between Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Python 3 is the latest version of the Python language and is not backward compatible with Python 2. The main syntax differences include the print function, integer division behavior, and function annotations. Python 3 also supports additional features such as Unicode support, new libraries, and improved exception handling. Additionally, Python 3 is more strict about certain syntax errors, meaning code needs to be more consistent and follow certain standards such as indenting. Python 2 has been deprecated and is no longer officially supported by the Python project.",
