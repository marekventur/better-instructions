  "output": "A helpful way to remember the Japanese characters for \u201ctsuki\u201d (\u6708) and \u201cyume\u201d (\u5922) is to associate them with a mental image. For example, \u201ctsuki\u201d could be imagined as a bright, full moon in a clear night sky, while \u201cyume\u201d could be imagined as a starry sky filled with dreams.",
