  "input": "Could you provide some examples for uses of AI?",
  "output": "AI is being used in a wide range of applications including robotics, automated manufacturing, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. AI can also be used to better process and analyze large data sets to produce more accurate and efficient results. AI is being used to make decisions that are too complex or too time consuming for humans and to assist humans in tasks that require data analysis and pattern recognition.\nA few examples include advancing healthcare through automated diagnosis, enabling autonomous vehicles to drive safely and accurately, enhancing the performance of search engines, and improving machine translation and natural language processing.",
