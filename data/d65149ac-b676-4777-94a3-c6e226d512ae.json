  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to identify a dishonest source on the internet is to look at their credentials. Are they quoting reputable sources? Are the sources they provide reliable? Also, look for grammatical and factual errors, especially if the content is supposed to be expert advice. Additionally, check for bias in the content by looking for words or phrases that are loaded with emotion. Finally, if the content is promoting a product or service, read user reviews before trusting the source.",
