  "input": "",
  "output": "Recycling is an important part of conserving the Earth's resources and reducing pollution. By recycling materials such as paper, plastic and glass, we can reduce the amount of energy and resources needed to create new products. It also reduces landfill waste and pollution from incineration. Recycling helps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses, which are responsible for climate change. Furthermore, recycling can create economic benefits, as recycled materials can be made into new products to be sold. This also helps to create new jobs.",
