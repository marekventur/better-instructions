  "instruction": "Create a dance routine to the given song.",
  "input": "Song: Uptown Funk (Mark Ronson & Bruno Mars)",
  "output": "The dance routine for Uptown Funk begins with a jump-loop and a drop into the groove. To the beat of the music, the dancers start clapping and kicking their arms downward. With hands wider apart, they start jiving with a combination of salsa and hip hop dance moves. As the song builds up, they bring the intensity up with arm circles and hip shimmies, while keeping the feet and legs moving together. Once the chorus hits, they bring the energy and power up with strong arm gestures and shoulder rolls. As the song winds down, the dancers bring back the same moves but with increasing speed and intensity. The routine ends with a jump-loop and a drop, to start the cycle all over again.",
