  "output": "The energy-flow cycle of an ecosystem is the process through which energy is used and recycled by living organisms. Energy enters the system in the form of sunlight and is used by plants, which convert it into stored chemical energy through photosynthesis. This stored chemical energy is then consumed by herbivores, and is further passed on to carnivores. The energy flow is eventually recycled back to the environment when organisms respire and die, releasing energy in the form of heat.",
