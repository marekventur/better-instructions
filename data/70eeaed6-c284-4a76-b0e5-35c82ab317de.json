  "output": "The summer sky is bright, \nwarming the air with its radiant light.\nSun filled days and golden nights,\nA beauty that even a poet can't write.\n\nThe lush green fields, the serene blue lake, \nCooling down in the shade of a swaying tree,\nDrenched in the beauty of the sunrays break\nA summer day, a perfect scenery.\n\nFloating clouds in the azure sky,\nWildflowers blooming in the meadows,\nLeaves swaying to the rhythm of the wind's sigh,\nThe beauty of nature, it never ceases to show.\n\nThe world breathes and takes a break,\nSummer days so beautiful and pure,\nFilling hearts with joy and love to make\nA memory to treasure forevermore.",
