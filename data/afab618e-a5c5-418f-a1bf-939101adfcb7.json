  "input": "",
  "output": "A deviated septum is an abnormal condition where the septum, the wall of cartilage and bone separating the right and left sides of the nose, is crooked or shifted. The condition may be present at birth or the result of an injury to the nose. A deviated nasal spine is a bony growth at the tip of the nose that causes the tip to look crooked when viewed from the front. It can result from trauma, over-aggressive surgery, or an inherited trait.",
