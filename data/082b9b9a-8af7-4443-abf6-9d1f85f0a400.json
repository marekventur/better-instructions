  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between supervised and unsupervised tasks is the nature of the data. In a supervised task, the dataset used to train the model is labeled, meaning that it already contains labels or desired output attributes. This enables the model to make accurate predictions based on given inputs. In unsupervised tasks, on the other hand, the dataset does not contain labels or desired output attributes and the model must learn patterns from the data itself. Unsupervised tasks are typically used for clustering tasks, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection.",
