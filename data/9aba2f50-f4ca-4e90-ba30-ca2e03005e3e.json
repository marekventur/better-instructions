  "instruction": "Explain how coastal erosion happens.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Coastal erosion is the process by which the ocean, rivers, and waves erode land and wash away sediment, resulting in a change in the shoreline. It is caused by the constant pounding of waves and water currents eroding the shoreline, which can weaken rocks and move soil over time. In addition, storms and high tides can cause increased erosion, as they can increase the intensity and speed of the wave action. As the shoreline erodes, land is lost, sometimes causing a permanent change in the shape of the coastline.",
