  "output": "In a decade, the environment can be drastically changed by human activity. Increasing emissions of greenhouse gases can lead to global warming, resulting in climate change, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events. Deforestation, overfishing, and other human-driven activities can also lead to a decrease in biodiversity, deforestation can lead to water contamination, and overfishing can deplete fish populations.",
