  "input": "",
  "output": "The phases of the moon occur as it orbits the Earth and is illuminated by the Sun. The phases are: New Moon, Waxing Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous, Full Moon, Waning Gibbous, Third Quarter, and Waning Crescent. The New Moon is when the Moon is completely dark and cannot be seen. The Waxing Crescent is when the Moon is partially illuminated and only a small portion is visible. The First Quarter is when the Moon is half illuminated and looks like a \u201cD\u201d shape. The Waxing Gibbous is when the Moon is more than half illuminated and looks like a \u201cU\u201d shape. The Full Moon is when the Moon is completely illuminated and exists for approximately three days. The Waning Gibbous is when the Moon is more than half illuminated but with the opposite side to the First Quarter. The Third Quarter is when the Moon is half illuminated with the opposite side to the First Quarter. Finally, the Waning Crescent is when the Moon is partially illuminated and only a small portion is visible.",
