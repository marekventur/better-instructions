  "input": "",
  "output": "Verse 1:\nRolling with the punches, I stay strong,\nFeeling all sorts of emotions, I can't go wrong,\nRaising up my spirit and never countin' down,\nBeing positive even through despair, I'm standing proud.\n\nHook:\nBe thine own positivist, keep it moving right,\nSpread the knowledge of staying up through fight,\nNo time to worry, be wonderous and light,\nHead out and strive, watch positivity take flight.\n\nVerse 2:\nFacing wild curves, I just keep going,\nFeeling salty blues, but never showing,\nRise up and become victorious every night,\nHustle hard, don't go giving up that easily, alright.",
