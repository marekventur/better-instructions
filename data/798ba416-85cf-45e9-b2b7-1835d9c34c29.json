  "input": "",
  "output": "There are several ethical considerations related to Artificial Intelligence, such as data privacy, data security, algorithmic bias, autonomy, data integrity and transparency. For example, AI systems may store and process sensitive data, and therefore, data privacy and security must be taken into account. AI systems should also be auditable and have measures in place to avoid any form of discrimination, as well as mechanisms to detect, investigate and rectify any bias. Furthermore, Autonomy should be ensured by ensuring that it is able to work independently, without any direct supervision of a human being. Finally, data integrity and transparency are important to ensure that the AI system is not skewed.",
