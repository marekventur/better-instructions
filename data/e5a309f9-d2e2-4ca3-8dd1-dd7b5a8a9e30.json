  "instruction": "Describe the differences between a tall and a dwarf variety of a plant",
  "input": "Apple trees",
  "output": "The main difference between a tall and a dwarf variety of an apple tree is the size. Tall apple trees can reach up to 30 feet tall, while dwarf apple trees stay between 6 and 10 feet tall. Additionally, tall apple trees need more space for the roots to spread, making them better for larger yards or orchards. Dwarf apple trees are suitable for small yards or containers. Dwarf apple trees produce a smaller harvest than tall trees, but they require less pruning and produce fruit sooner. If a space-saving apple tree is desired, a dwarf variety is the way to go.",
