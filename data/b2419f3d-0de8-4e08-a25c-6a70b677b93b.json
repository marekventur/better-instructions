  "input": "",
  "output": "Break 2-3 eggs into a bowl, whisk them together, then add some salt and pepper and mix again. Heat a pan over medium heat and add a few tablespoons of oil or butter. Pour in the eggs, tilt the pan so that it covers the base evenly and let it cook for about 1-2 minutes. As the omelette sets, use a spatula to lift the edges and tilt the pan so uncooked egg runs to the edges. Stop cooking when it's lightly golden, fold it in half and serve it!",
