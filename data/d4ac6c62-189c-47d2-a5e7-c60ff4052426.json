  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a tree and a bush is size; a tree is generally taller, measuring more than 15 feet in height, while a bush is typically shorter and less than 15 feet. Trees typically have a single, large trunk and deeper roots than bushes. Tree leaves are usually larger, and many trees lose their leaves in winter. Bushes may have multiple stems and typically have shallow roots. They are often evergreen and can be shaped by pruning.",
