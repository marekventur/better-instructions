  "input": "",
  "output": "A creative way to introduce yourself to a new team is to use a \"virtual icebreaker\". Prepare a brief video of yourself introducing yourself to the team. In the video, provide a fun fact about yourself and then pose a question to the team, like \"What is your favorite hobby?\" Afterwards, invite everyone in the team to record a short video response. This is a great way to start conversations and get to know your new team more intimately.",
