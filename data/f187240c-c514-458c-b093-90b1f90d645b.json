  "instruction": "Generate an equation that describes the motion of a ball dropped from a height",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The equation for the motion of a ball dropped from a height is s = {1 \\over 2}gt^2, where s is the displacement (distance) of the ball from its starting point, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and t is the time elapsed. This equation expresses the fact that the ball's velocity increases by an amount proportional to the acceleration due to gravity with each second that passes.",
