  "output": "The greenhouse effect is a process by which radiation from a planet's atmosphere warms the surface to a temperature above what it would be without its atmosphere. This effect is caused by certain gases in the atmosphere, such as water vapor, that can trap more energy from the sun, warming the surface and making the atmosphere a beneficial force for life on the planet. Without these gases, the average temperature on our planet would be much lower, making life virtually impossible on Earth.",
