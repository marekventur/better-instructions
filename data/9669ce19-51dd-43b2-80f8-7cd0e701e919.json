  "output": "Photosynthesis and respiration are both processes that involve the exchange of gases and the conversion of energy. Photosynthesis is a process in which light energy from the sun is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Respiration is a process in which glucose and oxygen are converted into carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Both processes are essential for sustaining life on Earth.",
