  "output": "Complications of a broken bone may include infection, swelling and numbness, persistent pain, damage to nerves, blood vessels and muscles, stiffness, and deformity. Infection is the most common complication, and can sometimes require surgery, antibiotics, or both. Swelling and numbness may slow the healing process and damage the surrounding tissue, while persistent pain can limit mobility and impact quality of life. Damage to nerves, blood vessels, and muscles can cause further complications, including stiffness, deformity, and nerve changes that can cause sensations such as tingling and burning.",
