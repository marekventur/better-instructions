  "output": "Neural networks are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm used to identify patterns in data. They are inspired by the way neurons in the brain work, with networks of nodes that are connected together. Neural networks are commonly used for supervised machine learning tasks such as classification, prediction, and speech and image recognition. In these tasks, the neural network is trained with large sets of labeled data and is then able to identify patterns in new or unseen data.",
