  "output": "Genetic engineering is the manipulation of an organism's genetic material to manipulate its characteristics. It has been used for centuries through methods such as animal and plant breeding, but modern genetic engineering techniques allow more precise manipulation of the genome. Techniques such as gene editing and gene splicing are used to insert, delete, and modify genetic material, and are used to create genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Genetic engineering is used in a variety of applications, including agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology.",
