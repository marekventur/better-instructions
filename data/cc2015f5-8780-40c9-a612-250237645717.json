  "input": "",
  "output": "Recursion is a technique for solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems of the same type. It is commonly used in computer programming to make algorithms more efficient by repeating a process until a certain condition is met. For example, when a program encounters a problem that has a similar structure to the problem it has already solved, it can use recursion to reuse the solutions it has already found.",
