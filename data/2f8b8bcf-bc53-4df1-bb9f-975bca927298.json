  "instruction": "What is the difference between a formal and informal letter?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The difference between a formal and informal letter is the type of language used, the level of politeness, and the format. In formal letters, the language is more formal and polite, the sentences are structured in a way that follows a specific format, and the letter is more likely to address a person of a higher status than in an informal letter. An informal letter is more conversational in tone, as opposed to a formal letter which is more direct, and the format is not as strict. Additionally, with informal letters, the letter is often written to someone of equal or lower status.",
