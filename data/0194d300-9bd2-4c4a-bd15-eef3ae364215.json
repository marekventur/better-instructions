  "output": "Bird Watch and Count: Participants in this activity will observe and record the number and types of birds in their local area or habitat. They should keep a record of the number of individual birds they saw, as well as the species, the habitat they were in, and any other type of behavioral data they observe. At the end of the activity, participants should tabulate the results in order to gain a better understanding of population dynamics in that area.",
