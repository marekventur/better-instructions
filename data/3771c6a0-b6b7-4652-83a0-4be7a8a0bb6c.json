  "output": "This delicious recipe for Chocolate Kiss Crinkle Cookies is sure to please! Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Next, cream together 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add 1/2 cup packed brown sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and beat until well combined. In a separate bowl, sift together 1 cup all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until combined. Finally, fold in 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and shape the dough into 1-inch balls. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and press a Hershey\u2019s Kiss into the top of each cookie. Bake for 8-10 minutes and enjoy!",
