  "input": "Reducing greenhouse gas emisssions and improving energy efficiency in the industrial and transportation sectors.",
  "output": "Plan to Mitigate Global Warming:\n- Improve energy efficiency by setting higher standards for energy efficiency for all industrial and transportation sectors.\n- Increase the adoption of renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind power in both industrial and transportation sectors.\n- Promote the use of efficient methods of production and create incentives or subsidies for companies who switch over to green energy.\n- Develop a system to monitor and reduce emissions from all industries, with penalties for companies which exceed emissions limits.\n- Increase public awareness about climate change and its impact, and encourage individuals to reduce their carbon footprints by shifting to renewable energy sources, recycling, and reducing water and energy consumption.\n- Strategically invest in research and development of new technology and techniques to reduce carbon emissions and improve carbon-capturing techniques such as biosequestration.\n- Preserve and promote existing forests and other carbon sinks, and develop plans to plant more trees.\n- Enforce regulations at both state and national levels that require companies to use environmentally friendly practices in their operations.",
