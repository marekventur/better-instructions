  "output": "The future of transportation will be heavily influenced by advances in technology. Autonomous vehicles, such as self-driving cars, will play an increasingly important role as they become more sophisticated and widely adopted. Advances in electric vehicles, such as electric cars, will also be important for making transportation greener and more affordable. The development of new materials and techniques for manufacturing parts and components, such as 3D printing, will also revolutionize the industry. Finally, new technologies, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, will be leveraged to improve safety, reliability, and convenience, making transportation more efficient and trustworthy.",
