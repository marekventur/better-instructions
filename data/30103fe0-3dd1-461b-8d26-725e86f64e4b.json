  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between X-ray and MRI is in the way the images are produced. X-ray is created using X-rays to produce an image, while MRI is produced using a combination of magnetic fields and radio waves. X-ray is often used to diagnose broken bones and to view organs such as the lungs, while MRI can be used to provide an even more detailed image of the entire body or specific organs.",
