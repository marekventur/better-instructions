  "input": "",
  "output": "Dear Senator [name], \n\nI am writing to express my opinion on gun control laws. I believe that gun control laws should be enacted to reduce the amount of gun violence and protect citizens from the dangers of guns. Individuals should be subject to background checks to ensure that they are not a risk to public safety before being allowed to purchase a firearm. Additionally, I believe the age restriction for gun purchases should be raised. Young people are not mature enough to handle the responsibility of owning a firearm, so I believe that the minimum age should be increased from 18 to 21. \n\nI urge you to take action and push for legislation that will make gun control more stringent and better protect citizens.\n\nSincerely, \n[Name]",
