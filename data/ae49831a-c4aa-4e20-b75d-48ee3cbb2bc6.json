  "output": "Random access memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory which stores data and instructions for the processor to access. It allows the processor to quickly access the data needed for a task, rather than having to search for the data on a hard drive. RAM is volatile, meaning the data is lost upon power loss. It is often used to store the operating system, and applications and data currently in use.",
