  "output": "Football is a competitive game that follows a set of rules. It is played between two teams with 11 players on each side. The objective is to score points by either advancing the ball into the team's opponent's goal area or by kicking the ball between two posts at each end of the field. Players can advance the ball in different ways, such as kicks, passes, and carries. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. Penalties are awarded for violations such as blocking or holding other players, which can help the opposing team gain an advantage.",
