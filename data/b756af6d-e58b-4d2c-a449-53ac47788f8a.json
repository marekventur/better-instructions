  "input": "",
  "output": "A decision tree is a graphical representation of possible solutions to a problem, based on certain conditions. It is a tool used to help people choose between multiple options by creating an organized visual map of the decision-making process. The tree branches out from a single root node to one or more end nodes, each containing a potential decision or outcome. Each node in the tree is an intersection in the branches, and these nodes represent a decision point. The branches from the nodes represent the possible outcomes that can happen based on a given decision, and the leaves signify the end of the tree. The decision tree is used to evaluate and predict outcomes in order to make informed decisions.",
