  "output": "The evolutionary history of the American buffalo goes back all the way to the Ice Age around 11,000 years ago. This species originated in North America and spread outward from there. With their large size and adaptability to most environments, buffaloes quickly became widespread. While their numbers were drastically reduced in the 19th century due to overhunting and habitat loss, their population has since made a comeback.",
