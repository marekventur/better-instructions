  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary difference between an LLC and a limited partnership is that a limited partnership has two or more partners with rights to manage the company, while an LLC has only one managing partner. Another difference is that a limited partnership has fewer restrictions when it comes to distributing profits among the partners, while an LLC is a separate legal entity with a shared responsibility for liabilities and profits.",
