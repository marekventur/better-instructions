  "instruction": "Explain why single cell organisms are simpler than multicellular organisms.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Single-celled organisms are simpler than multicellular organisms because they do not require complex organ systems to function. Single-celled organisms are autonomous and able to survive on their own, while multicellular organisms require cooperation between cells in order to survive. Single-celled organisms rely on their own machinery to perform all necessary functions, while multicellular organisms require a sophisticated network of cells working together to maintain basic needs. Additionally, single-celled organisms lack an immune system, making them vulnerable to disease and environmental factors, while multicellular organisms are better equipped to protect themselves from outside threats.",
