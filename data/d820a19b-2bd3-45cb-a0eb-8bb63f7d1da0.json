  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a child named Lila who was afraid of the dark. No matter how much her parents tried to encourage her, she still couldn't get past her fear of the dark. She would beg her parents to keep her bedroom door open when she slept, but they knew that was not a suitable solution. In an attempt to help Lila confront her fear, they took her camping and showed her the beauty of the night sky, the gentle light of the stars, and the peacefulness of the darkness. The experience changed her, and she became no longer afraid of the dark. From then on, she would always sleep with her bedroom door closed and she never feared the dark again.",
