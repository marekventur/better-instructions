  "output": "Good morning everyone. Today, I'm here to discuss the importance of saving water. As we know, water is essential for life, and yet it\u2019s rapidly becoming scarce. We need to conserve it before it's too late. Every drop of water counts and so does every effort we make in conserving it. We need to adopt water-saving habits at home and work, use water-efficient technologies, and advocate for better water governance. Thank you.",
