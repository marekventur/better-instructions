  "output": "The \"golden circle\" concept in business is a structure for understanding how a company should define its purpose, values, and vision. It is based on the concept that businesses should start with the \"why\" instead of the \"what,\" which is why, what, and how. The \"why\" is the purpose, the \"what\" involves the values and principles, and the \"how\" is the vision and strategy.",
