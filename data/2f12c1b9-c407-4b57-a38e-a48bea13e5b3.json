  "instruction": "Can you compare economic growth in developing countries to economic growth in developed countries?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Developing countries often have much higher rates of economic growth than developed countries. This is because the former have greater potential to expand the economy due to their lower per capita incomes, larger populations, and the availability of resources. They are also less burdened by aging infrastructure and more amenable to technological innovations. In contrast, developed economies are often limited by existing infrastructure, slower population growth and limited capacity for innovations.",
