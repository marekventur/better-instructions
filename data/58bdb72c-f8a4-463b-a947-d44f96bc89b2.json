  "input": "",
  "output": "Essentially, Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, which is a wide-encompassing field that deals with teaching computers to comprehend and make decisions based on the data given. Machine Learning specifically focuses on algorithms and systems that are capable of learning from the vast amounts of data available and making predictions or arriving at optimal solutions on their own. Artificial Intelligence, on the other hand, uses Machine Learning along with other advanced techniques such as natural language processing and logic reasoning to achieve highly complex cognitive tasks.",
