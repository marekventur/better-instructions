  "output": "When building an AI-enhanced camera system, several factors should be considered. Accuracy and fairness of the system should be ensured by using multiple steps of authentication and preventing bias in the input data and algorithms. Additionally, privacy measures should be taken to ensure the security of data and protect users from potential misuse of private information. Moreover, transparency in decision-making processes should be ensured and oversight should be included in order to ensure accountability.",
