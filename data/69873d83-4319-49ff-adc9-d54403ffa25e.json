  "output": "Three potential use cases in healthcare for natural language processing: \n\n1. Clinical Note Summarization: Natural language processing-based systems can help clinicians to quickly and accurately summarize patient notes. This can enable doctors to more easily review patient records, helping to improve the accuracy and efficiency of patient care. \n\n2. Diagnosis Prediction: Natural language processing can also be used to predict disease diagnosis based on patient history. Using machine learning algorithms, doctors can process information from patient notes, helping them to more accurately identify and diagnose conditions. \n\n3. Virtual Health Assistants: Natural language processing-powered virtual health assistants can provide helpful information and support for patients. By using natural language processing, these assistants can learn to understand the user, interpret their questions, and provide them with helpful advice.",
