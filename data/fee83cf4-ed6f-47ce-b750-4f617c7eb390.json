  "input": "",
  "output": "An airport security system is a comprehensive system of checks and procedures designed to ensure the safety of passengers and staff at airports. It includes metal detectors, X-ray machines, and body scanners, as well as baggage and other security checks. All passengers and staff must pass through metal detectors, and the bags are screened by X-ray machines. Body scanners are also used to detect items that may not be visible to the X-rays, such as metal weapons or explosives. Finally, all bags must be checked against a list of prohibited items and any suspicious items must be examined by security staff.",
