  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a house in a forest near a lake. There lived a little girl and her pet dog. Every day they would go outside to pick apples and enjoy the sunshine. The tree in their garden was full of cats and birds, and the grass around it was full of flowers and butterflies. One day, the girl found a special book beneath the apple tree \u2013 a book filled with secrets and stories of magical creatures. She and her dog spent the afternoon exploring the pond, looking for chickens and other animals in the grass.",
