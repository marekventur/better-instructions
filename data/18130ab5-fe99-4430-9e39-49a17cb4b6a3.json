  "input": "",
  "output": "The star formation process begins with a huge cloud of gas and dust, known as a molecular cloud. As it contracts due to gravity, it begins to form stars. A protostar then forms, which is a collapsed object that continues to contract until the core becomes dense and hot enough for nuclear fusion to begin. Once the protostar reaches the main sequence, it stabilizes and is considered a full-fledged star.",
