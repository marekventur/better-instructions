  "input": "",
  "output": "A computer is able to store data by using electronic circuits in a memory device. The memory stores the data in the form of binary digits, typically 0 or 1. The data is then broken down into smaller pieces or \u201cwords\u201d, which can range in size from 8 to 64 bits each. Each of these words can represent an instruction, a number, or any other type of data, and can be retrieved from the memory when needed.",
