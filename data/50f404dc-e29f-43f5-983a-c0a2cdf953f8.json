  "output": "The process of mitosis in a cell involves four stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, and anaphase. During prophase, the chromatin in the nucleus condenses into chromosomes. During prometaphase, the nuclear membrane breaks down and the chromosome pairs move towards the middle of the cell. Metaphase involves the allignment of the chromosomes at the middle of the cell. During anaphase, the chromosomes separate and spindle fibers attached to the centromere pull the chromosomes apart. Finally, in telophase, a new nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes and the cell splits in to two daughter cells.",
