  "input": "",
  "output": "The best way to address poverty in the local community is to ensure that those living in poverty have access to resources that can provide them with the necessary support to obtain and maintain financial stability. This plan should include the following steps: \n1. Create job opportunities for people in the community. This can include offering incentives for businesses to hire local people or connecting individuals with education and job resources. \n2. Establish community access points and services that can provide access to food, housing, childcare, and other resources. \n3. Invest in programs and initiatives that can teach community members how to manage their finances, such as budgeting and the basics of banking.\n4. Provide access to healthcare and mental health resources. \n5. Encourage the development of job-training programs and skills that can help people gain new skills they need to enter the workforce.",
