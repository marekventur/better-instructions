  "input": "",
  "output": "Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another medium of different densities. It is caused by the change in speed and wavelength of light as it goes from one medium to another. When light moves from air to glass, for example, the speed of light slows down and the light bends. The degree of bending is determined by the refractive index of the two materials.",
