  "output": "Improving the performance of a linear regression model involves reducing the error between the predicted and the actual output. This can be done by i)adding more features that are relevant to predicting the output, ii)reducing multicollinearity between features, iii)removing outliers, and iv)using regularization techniques like lasso or ridge regression.",
