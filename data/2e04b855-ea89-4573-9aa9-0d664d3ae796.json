In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients: 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. In another bowl, cream together 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup granulated sugar. Add 2 eggs and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and mix until well combined. Mash two ripe bananas, and add them to the mixture, along with 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. Fill greased muffin cups 2/3 full with the batter. Bake for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Enjoy!",
