  "output": "Two old friends, Katherine and Sarah, sat in the park, catching up on each other\u2019s lives after months of separation. They talked about their jobs, their families, and the ups and downs of the year that had passed. They laughed, they cried, and they reminisced on the memories they had made together. They made plans to get together again soon and hugged each other goodbye as the sun began to set. This was a meeting that neither would soon forget.",
