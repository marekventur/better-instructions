  "input": "",
  "output": "The current state of AI technology is far less advanced than its potential future. Current AI technology is mostly limited to logical processing and decision-making capabilities, with some applications, such as virtual assistants and robotic process automation becoming more widespread. However, in the future, AI technology has the potential to become vastly advanced and more capable. AI is expected to be able to learn autonomously by exploring and approaching problems in a more thoughtful and advanced manner. On the other hand, potential applications of advanced future AI such as autonomous vehicles, medical breakthroughs, and smart cities have been predicted but are still far from fully realized.",
