  "input": "",
  "output": "Microeconomics and macroeconomics are two branches of economics that examine economic decision-making on two different levels. Microeconomics focuses on how individual households and firms interact within the marketplace to make economic decisions, while macroeconomics looks at how the economy as a whole behaves over time and examines the aggregate economic variables at play such as employment, inflation, and economic growth. \n\nOne of the primary differences between micro and macroeconomics is the scope of analysis. Microeconomics looks at the economics on a smaller scale, analyzing the behavior of individual households and firms, and specifically how their decisions affect supply and demand. Macroeconomics focuses on the larger picture, looking at factors such as unemployment, inflation, and GDP growth and how these factors interact to shape the overall economy.",
