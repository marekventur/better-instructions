  "input": "",
  "output": "Mean-Squared Error (MSE) is a widely used metric for evaluating the performance of models, such as machine learning algorithms. MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual observed values. This metric can be used to assess the predictive power of a model, as it provides a measure of how close the predicted values are to the actual observed values. MSE can also be used to compare multiple models in order to determine which one is the most accurate.",
