  "input": "",
  "output": "Pole vaulting is based on the scientific principles of force, velocity, mass and momentum. When a person swings the pole, centripetal force is generated, allowing the vaulter to move in a circular motion without having to be in contact with the pole. As the vaulter moves in a circular motion, potential energy is stored in the pole, which is then converted to kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is then used to boost the vaulter higher into the air, where gravity takes over and pulls them down. Momentum is also required, as the vaulter needs to transfer the momentum generated by the swinging of the pole to the vertical motion of the vault.",
