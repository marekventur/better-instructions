  "input": "\"Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.\" \u2013 Albert Einstein",
  "output": "In today's society, people are often judged by their ability to perform certain tasks rather than the unique skills and strengths they possess. This quote from Albert Einstein serves as a reminder to us not to limit ourselves and others by what we think is possible. It also serves as a reminder to appreciate the potential and greatness which exists in each person, regardless of how they express it. By recognizing the unique skills and potential of each person, we are able to unlock a greater potential in the world and create a more inclusive and just society.",
