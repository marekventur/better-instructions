  "input": "",
  "output": "A blockchain is a type of digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and immutable manner. It is a distributed system, meaning that it does not rely on any single entity for data storage. Each transaction is stored in a block and the blocks are strung together and secured cryptographically, forming a chain of blocks. This chain of blocks allows for a distributed and tamper-proof system of record-keeping, making it a secure and reliable way of storing and transferring data.",
