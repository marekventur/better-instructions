  "instruction": "Write a description of what a human heart looks like.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The human heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood around the body. It is shaped like an upside-down cone and is approximately the size of a closed fist. It is located in the chest, behind the breastbone and above the diaphragm. The heart is made up of four chambers, two on the right side and two on the left. The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs and the left side pumps oxygenated blood around the body. There is a thick muscular wall between the two halves that separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, ensuring that the blood is not mixed.",
