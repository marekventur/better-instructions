  "output": "Dr. Wilkins had been a doctor for many years. He had seen many patients come and go, but he had a special fondness for one particular patient. This patient had come to him seeking help with a troubling medical problem. The doctor had been able to provide relief and, over the years, the two had developed a close bond. As the patient recovered, their relationship evolved from doctor-patient to something more. They started to meet up after the patient's appointments and went out for coffee or a stroll in the park. The patient was grateful for the doctor\u2019s help, both physical and emotional, and the doctor was moved by his patient\u2019s hard work and determination. In the end, their friendship had grown into something greater and at last, the doctor and his patient were in love.",
