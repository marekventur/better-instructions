Which one are you interested in? \n\nCustomer: I'm looking for something comfortable and stylish. Do you have any recommendations?\n\nSalesperson: Absolutely. I just got in a shipment of running shoes with a very breathable fabric. Or if you're looking for something more formal, we also have some great leather dress shoes. Which one would you like to try on first? \n\nCustomer: Ooh I like the sound of those running shoes. Can I see them?\n\nSalesperson: Sure, let me get them for you. Here they are! What do you think?\n\nCustomer: They look really good! I'll take them.\n\nSalesperson: Great! Let me ring them up for you.",
