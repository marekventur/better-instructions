  "input": "",
  "output": "The Articles of Confederation was the first constitution of the United States and was adopted in 1777. It proposed a loose confederacy with the power distributed among the states, providing a central government with limited powers and no executive branch.\n\nThe Constitution was adopted in 1787, replacing the Articles of Confederation. It establisheed a strong federal government with powers distributed among three branches\u2014legislative, executive, and judicial. There is also a system of federalism, where power is shared between the states and the federal government.\n\nThe two documents differ in terms of their structure and power allocations. The Articles of Confederation was weaker and did not empower the national government to efficiently address national issues or to regulate interstate commerce, while the Constitution provided more power to the federal government in order to better address national issues.",
