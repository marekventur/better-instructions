  "instruction": "Think of an example of a moral dilemma and explain why it is difficult to make a decision.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of a moral dilemma is the utilitarianism vs. deontology debate. The utilitarianism approach to morality focuses on producing the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people, while the deontology approach believes that there is a certain right and wrong and that certain actions are inherently right or wrong regardless of the overall good it might bring.  In this moral dilemma, it is difficult to make a decision because either approach has its advantages and disadvantages and will result in a different outcome for different people in different situations. It is important to consider both the long-term and short-term consequences of a decision in order to make the best decision possible.",
