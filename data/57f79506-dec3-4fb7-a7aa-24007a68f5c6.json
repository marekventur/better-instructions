  "output": "To build a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, start by gathering the pieces needed. There should be 9 center pieces, 8 corner pieces, and 12 edge pieces. Each piece should have 6 different colored faces. \n\nBegin by arranging the center pieces so that each face has one color. The corner pieces then need to be connected to the center pieces and the edge pieces should be connected in between the corner and center pieces. Make sure that each face has one uniform color and make sure the edge pieces are connected properly. With all the pieces in their appropriate place, the cube is ready to complete.",
