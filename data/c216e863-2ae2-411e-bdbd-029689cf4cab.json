  "output": "Gravity is a force of attraction between objects with mass. It is the force that is responsible for keeping us grounded to the Earth and for satellites to stay in orbit around planets. Objects with more mass experience a stronger force of gravity than objects with less mass. According to the theory of general relativity, gravity is caused by the curvature of space-time, which is affected by the presence of matter and energy.",
