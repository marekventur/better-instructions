  "input": "",
  "output": "A shallow neural network is composed of input and output layers, with one or two hidden layers in between. The number of parameters in a shallow neural network is much less than in a deep neural network, making shallow neural networks more efficient in terms of memory and computational power. Deep neural networks are composed of multiple hidden layers, allowing them to process more complex data and perform more complex tasks. The number of parameters in a deep neural network is much larger than a shallow neural network, making them capable of achieving higher accuracy for certain tasks.",
