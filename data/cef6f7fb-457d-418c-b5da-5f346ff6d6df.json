  "output": "One way to make a delicious keto-friendly dinner is to prepare roasted salmon with vegetables. Start by marinating a piece of salmon with olive oil, lemon juice, and spices of your choice. Then, roast the salmon in a preheated oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Fill a baking dish with pre-cut vegetables like asparagus, bell peppers, and onions; drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and roast at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes. Serve the salmon and vegetables with a side of avocado for an easy and flavorful keto dinner.",
