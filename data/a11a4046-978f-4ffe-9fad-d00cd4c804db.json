  "output": "Last year, I was tasked with improving the sales conversion rate of our website. To do this, I collected data on our user interactions with the website, including page speeds, website design elements, and checkout process. I then ran analysis on the data to identify areas where we could make changes to improve the user experience. I presented the insights with the team, which prompted us to make a series of changes to optimize the user journey. These changes led to an increase in sales conversion rate of 10% in just a few weeks.",
