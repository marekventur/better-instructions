  "output": "The natural disasters most commonly experienced in India are floods, cyclones, droughts, landslides, avalanches, extreme temperature events, earthquakes, and air pollution. Floods usually occur during monsoon season, caused by excessive rainfall and poor infrastructure. Cyclones are intense low-pressure cyclonic storms that cause heavy rains and strong wind gusts, often leading to flooding and death. Droughts are periods of unusually low precipitation that can lead to water shortages, crop failure, and famine. Landslides occur when high levels of precipitation cause the soil and rocks to become unstable and slide downhill, resulting in property damage. Avalanches occur when a large mass of snow is destabilized and slides down a mountain. Extreme temperatures can be experienced in the summers due to heat waves and in the winters due to cold waves, causing deadly heat- and cold- related illnesses. Earthquakes can occur due to tectonic plate shifts, resulting in injures and deaths as well as destruction of property and infrastructure. Finally, air pollution caused by factors such as burning of fossil fuels, automobiles, and industrial plants can lead to respiratory diseases and poor public health.",
