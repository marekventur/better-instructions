  "output": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are technologies that allow individuals to directly interface their brains with a computer. This technology is being developed to give those with physical or cognitive impairments a way to use their minds to control their environment. BCI works by decoding brain signals, such as those associated with movement or thought. These signals can then be used to control a device, such as a wheelchair or a robotic prosthetic. The hope of using BCI is that with continued research and development, individuals will soon be able to control their environment without needing to use their body. BCI also has implications for non-disabled individuals. With further development, BCI could offer a more efficient way to interact with computers than a traditional mouse and keyboard.",
