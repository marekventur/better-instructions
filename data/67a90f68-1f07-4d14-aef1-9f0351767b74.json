  "output": "Mental health is essential for leading a productive and happy life. A variety of factors can lead to poor mental health including stress, lack of sleep, and poor nutrition. Therefore, it is important to take proactive steps to take care of ourselves and our mental wellbeing. \n\nOne of the most important things you can do is make the commitment to prioritize your mental health. Make sure to carve out time every day to de-stress. Spend some time meditating, practicing yoga, or listening to a guided audio practice. Additionally, make sure to get adequate amounts of sleep. Our brains need at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night to function well and help reduce stress. \n\nHaving a healthy diet is also essential for improving mental health. Avoiding sugary snacks and drinks, and eating foods with healthy fats and essential vitamins and minerals will help improve your mood, energy levels, and cognitive functioning. \n\nTake the time to connect with those around you. Connecting with others is important for staying emotionally healthy and can help provide a sense of purpose and connection. Schedule regular time with friends and family to hang out and share stories. \n\nTaking care of your mental health can be challenging, but it is an essential part of forming better habits. Practicing self-care and being mindful of what helps to reduce your stress will help improve your mental well-being.",
