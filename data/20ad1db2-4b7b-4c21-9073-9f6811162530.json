  "input": "Noinput",
  "output": "An AI program works by taking in data, processing it using algorithms, and providing an output. Data is input into the AI system, which passes it through a series of layers of algorithms to process it, culminating in an output. Each layer of algorithms is designed to extract a certain type of information, such as recognizing patterns or making decisions. The layers also provide feedback to each other, enabling the system to continually learn and improve its accuracy.",
