  "instruction": "Describe how you solved a complex problem.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "When I encountered a complex problem, I started by breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. I then analyzed each piece and identified patterns or commonalities between the different pieces. With this knowledge, I created a structured plan with specific objectives for each step in resolving the complex problem. I also asked for help from mentors or colleagues when needed, as this allowed me to develop a better understanding of the complexity of the problem. Finally, I monitored my progress to make sure I was staying on the right track, and adjusted the plan and objectives if necessary.",
