  "input": "The experience of using this platform was exceptional.",
  "output": "An appropriate sentiment analysis technique for the given text would be a lexicon-based approach. This approach extracts sentiment from words, phrases, or sentences by comparing them to a lexicon of predefined sentiments. In this case, the text contains words such as 'exceptional', which have a strongly positive sentiment associated with them. Therefore, a lexicon-based approach would be the most appropriate technique for this text.",
