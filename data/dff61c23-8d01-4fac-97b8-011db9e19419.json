  "instruction": "Transform the equation 12x + 7y = 24 into a standard form.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The equation can be transformed into the following standard form: 12x - 7y = -24. To achieve this, the equation must be divided by 12 and then the two sides must be equalized. On the left side of the equation, divide 12x by 12 to get x. On the right side of the equation subtract 7y from both sides to get -24.",
