  "input": "",
  "output": "An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and with the non-living environment. Ecosystems consist of biotic components - organisms that interact with each other and with their environment - and abiotic components - such as climate, soil, water, and sunlight. In an ecosystem, organisms interact with each other and with their environment to create a balanced and sustainable system. They benefit from the resources in their environment, while also providing services such as pollination and pest control. This balance between the organisms and their environment is essential for ecosystems to function correctly.",
