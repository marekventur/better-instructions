  "input": "Number of Trees | Species of Tree | Location | Size of Trees\n1 | Maple | Urban | Small\n2 | Pine | Suburban | Medium\n4 | Oak | Rural | Large",
  "output": "The estimated cost for a tree trimming service, based on the given dataset, would be dependent on a number of factors such as the location, species of tree, size of trees and the distance (travel expenses). \n\nFor 1 Maple tree in an urban location that is small in size, the cost would be around $50 to $100.\n\nFor 2 Pine trees in a suburban location with medium sizes, the cost would be around $80 to $150. \n\nFor 4 Oak trees in a rural location with large sizes, the cost would be around $120 to $250.",
