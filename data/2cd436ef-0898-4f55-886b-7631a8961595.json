  "input": "The night was dark, but the stars still shone down on the riverbank. The air was chilly and refreshing as Alex looked out at the moonlit water.",
  "output": "He took a deep breath, the crisp air revitalizing him. He could see a bridge in the distance, and thought to himself that it would be a perfect place to watch the sunrise tomorrow. Gathering his things, he trudged across the muddy bank and began the walk to the bridge. As he walked, he felt the wind gently brush against his face. He looked up to the stars and allowed himself to be lost in the beauty of the night.",
