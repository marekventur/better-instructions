  "output": "A tea kettle is a type of pot with a lid and handle used to heat water for making tea. It usually has a spout, so that the boiling water can be easily poured from the pot. The most common type of tea kettles are made of metal, but there are also ceramic and glass kettles available. Some have a whistle that signals when the water has reached its boiling point. The boiling water can then be poured over tea leaves to make a delicious cup of tea.",
