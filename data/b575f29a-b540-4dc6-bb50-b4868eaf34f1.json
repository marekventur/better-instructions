  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between regular ice cream and gelato is their texture, fat content, and the amount of air they contain. Gelato is denser, creamier, and smoother than regular ice cream due to its lower fat content and lower churning process, which incorporates less air and produces a much thicker consistency. Additionally, it has a more intense flavor because more solids are added and less air is mixed in. On the other hand, regular ice cream contains more air and a higher fat content which creates a lighter, fluffier texture and a less intense flavor.",
