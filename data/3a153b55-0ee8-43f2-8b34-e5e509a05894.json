  "input": "",
  "output": "You could have a picnic in your backyard with all your friends and family, where all your favorite foods can be served. Get creative with decorations and prepare some fun games for everyone to play. You could organize a scavenger hunt to find hidden presents or a water balloon fight. At night, you and your friends can have a movie night with snacks, drinks and some of your favorite movies. You could also have a mini photoshoot with some creative props and set up a display of special memories. For something different, try having an outdoor karaoke night with some music and singing. You can even organize a virtual celebration with friends and family who are far away. There are plenty of ways to make your birthday special, so get creative!",
