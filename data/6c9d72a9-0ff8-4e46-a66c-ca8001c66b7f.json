  "instruction": "You're a fashion consultant. Your client needs help mix-and-matching different pieces. Which two pieces should they start with?",
  "input": "Formal dress pants with pink and green stripes\nLight blue chambray shirt",
  "output": "The client should start with the formal dress pants with pink and green stripes and the light blue chambray shirt. The light blue chambray shirt will provide contrast against the bold stripes on the pants, while not competing with it, as it is a subdued tone. The subtlety of the chambray will allow the client to add bolder accessories, such as a bright green or pink statement necklace or scarves, for a finished look.",
