  "output": "In a world that never experienced darkness, the people had to find new ways to keep track of time. As day and night blurred together, they developed a complex calendar based on the position of the sun and other stars in the sky. Without nighttime darkness, they found new and creative ways to relax, like gathering around roaring fire pits during the night. This world became a peaceful and vibrant place, full of activity during the day and night.",
