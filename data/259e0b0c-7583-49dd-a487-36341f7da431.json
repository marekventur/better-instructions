  "input": "",
  "output": "Stars and planets are vastly different celestial bodies. Stars are large, bright spheres of gas that produce their own light and heat, while planets are much smaller and usually lack the energy-producing abilities of stars. Stars are composed of mostly hydrogen, helium and some heavier elements, while planets are made up of mostly heavier elements. Stars live for billions of years and also move around in their orbits. In contrast, planets revolve around stars and have much shorter lifespans. Stars have immense gravitational pulls and generate their own light and heat, while planets are pulled and illuminated by the star they orbit.",
