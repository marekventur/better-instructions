  "instruction": "Design a device that can process requests from natural language",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The device should consist of several components. First, a speech recognition system will convert audio from the user into text. Then, a natural language processing (NLP) system will analyze this text and determine its meaning. Once the intent is determined, the device can access a database of information or applications related to the request, analyze the data, and provide a response. Finally, a text-to-speech system will convert the response into an audio signal.",
