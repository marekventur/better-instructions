  "instruction": "Formulate an argument for or against a given action.",
  "input": "Banning plastic bags.",
  "output": "An argument in support of banning plastic bags could be that they are a major source of pollution and contribute to environmental damage. Plastic bags are non-biodegradable, take hundreds of years to break down, and can be dangerous to wildlife. A ban on plastic bags would reduce this pollution, and encourage the use of more environmentally-friendly alternatives. On the other hand, an argument against banning plastic bags would be that it would be an overreaching regulation that would negatively impact businesses and could have an economic impact on consumers.",
