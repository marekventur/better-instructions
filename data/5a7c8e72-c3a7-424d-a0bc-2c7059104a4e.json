  "input": "",
  "output": "El Nino is an atmospheric phenomenon caused by changes in sea surface temperature in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. These changes, which usually occur around Christmas time, are caused by variations in the flow of warm water from the western Pacific and cold water upwelling from the lower latitudes. These changes in temperature changes the atmospheric pressure, which can cause heavy rains, floods, and droughts in different parts of the world.",
