  "input": "",
  "output": "The three leading causes of blindness are cataracts, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration. Cataracts are cloudiness in the lenses of the eyes that cause vision to become blurred or foggy. Glaucoma is an eye disease that damages the optic nerve, leading to a gradual loss of vision. Age-related macular degeneration is a degenerative eye disease that affects the macula, resulting in a loss of central vision.",
