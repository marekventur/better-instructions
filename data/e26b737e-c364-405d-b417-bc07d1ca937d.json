  "output": "Machine learning models face a variety of challenges when attempting to accurately predict outcomes. These challenges include the need to ensure sufficient data quality and quantity, the risk of overfitting, the problem of class imbalance, the curse of dimensionality, as well as challenges in dealing with noise or outliers present within the data. Additionally, machine learning models must be able to process data that is often heterogeneous, incomplete, and non-stationary. Furthermore, machine learning models must be able to robustly handle changing input features and trends, adapt to shifts in the environment, and generalize well to diverse data distributions.",
