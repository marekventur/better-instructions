  "output": "Clara is a 23 year old college student, currently studying psychology at a small university. She is tall with long blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. She wears glasses and usually dresses in dark colors and comfortable clothes. She always seems to be thinking deeply about something, and when asked about it she usually responds with something cryptic and mysterious. She is always helping her friends and family in any way she can, and is always ready with a listening ear and a supportive word. She is quiet, but can be surprisingly outspoken when she needs to be. She loves animals and works as a volunteer for an animal shelter on the weekends.",
