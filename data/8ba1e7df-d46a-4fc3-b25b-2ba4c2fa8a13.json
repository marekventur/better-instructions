  "input": "",
  "output": "The adventurers had been exploring the depths of a mysterious cave for days. Suddenly, a massive rock blocking off the way back was dislodged, trapping them in the depths. As time passed, provisions ran low and spirits began to wane. They had to find a way out, armed only with the skills and knowledge of the group. Working together, they managed to navigate their way out of the complex network of tunnels and eventually return to the surface.",
