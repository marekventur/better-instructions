Players play clockwise.\n- On their turn, a player can either draw a card from the draw pile, or play a card from their hand.\n- When a card is played, its value is compared to the previously played card. Highest card wins the trick, and the winner collects all the cards from the trick and places them face up in front of them.\n- Jokers are the highest cards, unless a higher card of the same suit is in play.\n- When the draw pile has no cards left, players can no longer draw cards and must only play cards from their hands. \n- The game ends when one player has no cards in their hand. The player with the most cards in front of them is the winner.",
