  "output": "The history of poverty in the United States is a long and complex one. In the early years of the nation, poverty was primarily a rural problem, with the vast majority of the population living in rural areas. Many rural populations were struggling with subsistence farming and small industries which were hardly enough to make a living. By the mid 20th century, however, poverty had become a major issue in the cities, thanks to industrialization, immigration, and displacement of rural populations. \n\nSince then, poverty has been a persistent issue in the United States. Despite significant progress over the last century, there are still millions of people living in poverty. Poverty in the United States is characterized by economic disparities, lack of access to health care and educational opportunities, and a wide income gap. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the poverty crisis, with poverty rates skyrocketing in 20",
