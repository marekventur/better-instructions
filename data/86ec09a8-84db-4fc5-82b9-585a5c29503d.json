  "output": "A three-dimensional model of a prism with a square base can be constructed using geometric shapes. Start by drawing a square on a flat surface and connecting the opposite corners with straight lines. Then, draw connecting lines from the top corners of the square to the top corners of the connected lines, creating a triangular shape. This will form the sides of the prism. Finally, connect the bottom corners of the triangle to the bottom corners of the square to form the base of the prism.",
