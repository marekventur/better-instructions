  "input": "",
  "output": "Renewable resources are those which can be replenished relatively quickly through natural processes. Examples include solar, wind and geothermal energy, as well as plant and animal products such as wood and wool. \n\nNonrenewable resources are those which take a much longer time to be replenished and are limited in supply. Examples include fossil fuels such as oil and coal, metals such as iron and aluminum, and minerals such as salt and phosphorus. These resources are depleted when used, and their availability is not as easily restored.",
