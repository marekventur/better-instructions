  "output": "Dear [Company],\nI recently purchased a refrigerator from your store and assumed that I was buying a product of quality. Unfortunately, I have recently noticed that the refrigerator door is developing rust, even though I have been taking all necessary precautions for the proper care and maintenance of the refrigerator. \nI paid a significant amount for this refrigerator and expected it to function properly for an extended amount of time. I am writing to request a refund or a replacement of the appliance, as I don't believe it is functioning to the best of its abilities.\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",
