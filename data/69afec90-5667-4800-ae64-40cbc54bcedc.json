  "output": "A nuclear power plant consists of a nuclear reactor, a steam turbine, a generator, a cooling system, and associated control systems. \n\nThe nuclear reactor generates heat by fission reactions inside its core, and this heat is used to generate pressurized steam. This steam then passes through a steam turbine to generate electricity. The generator uses the electricity to create an alternating current that is then sent to the power grid. \n\nThe cooling system circulates water around the core of the reactor to regulate its temperature and pressure. This cooling water is then cycled back around the reactor to be reheated and used again.\n\nFinally, the control system uses a combination of computers, sensors, and valves to monitor and regulate the nuclear reaction and the electricity grid. It also monitors the environment to prevent any radiation leaks.",
