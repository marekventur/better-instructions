  "input": "",
  "output": "Creating a \"cell phone safe-zone\" policy in the workplace is an important step towards maintaining a professional workplace environment. This policy would clearly delineate a specific area where cell phone use is not allowed, and this should be clearly communicated to all employees. Employers should also provide a system for employees to report any violations of the policy as well as a punishment system for those who are found in violation. It is important for management to proactively enforce this policy and firmly reprimand employees who are caught using their phones in the designated safe zone. Additionally, employers should provide alternative methods of communication, such as email or text, to enable employees to stay connected without having to use their phones in the workplace.  With a clear policy, effective enforcement, and flexible alternative forms of communication, employers can ensure a productive and respectful work environment.",
