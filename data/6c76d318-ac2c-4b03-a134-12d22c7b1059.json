  "output": "The India-China War of 1962 was a conflict between the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China fought from October 20 to November 21, 1962. The cause of the war was largely disputed, with both sides blaming the other for aggression. However, it is generally accepted that it was caused by differing perceptions of the Sino-Indian border, which had been disputed since the 1914 Simla Agreement. It was a major military engagement that saw heavy casualties and extensive damage to both countries. India was eventually forced to retreat and cede land, after China declared a unilateral ceasefire.",
