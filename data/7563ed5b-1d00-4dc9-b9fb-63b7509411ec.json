  "output": "A Turing Machine is an abstract machine created by Alan Turing in 1936. It is a theoretical computing device that consists of an infinite tape, a head that reads and moves across this tape, and a set of instructions for writing, erasing and moving the tape's contents. It is a model of computation that can be used to solve a range of problems, from computing the square root of a number to determining whether a given string is a palindrome.",
