  "input": "",
  "output": "The Fibonacci sequence can be calculated using a recursive algorithm, which is as follows: \n\ndef Fibonacci(n): \n  if n<=0: \n    return 0\n  elif n==1: \n    return 1\n  else: \n    return Fibonacci(n-1)+Fibonacci(n-2) \n\nThis algorithm uses recursion to calculate the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence. The algorithm begins by setting up two cases, one for n = 0 and the other for n = 1. If n = 0 or 1, the function simply returns the value of n.  If n is larger than 1, the function recursively calls itself twice, once for n-1 and once for n-2. The result of these recursive calls is added together to compute the Fibonacci number for n.",
