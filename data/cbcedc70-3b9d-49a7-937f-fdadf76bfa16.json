  "output": "High-waisted jeans come up high above the waist and usually have a slightly snugger fit than low-waisted jeans, which rest low on the hips and often have a looser fit. High-waisted jeans are also typically longer in the legs than low-waisted jeans. Low-waisted jeans can be both skinny jeans and straight or boot-cut jeans.",
