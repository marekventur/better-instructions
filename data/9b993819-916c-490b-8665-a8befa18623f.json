  "input": "",
  "output": "I present to you Disasteroids, a board game for up to 5 players. In Disasteroids, players explore and survive an unpredictable natural disaster-filled world by dominating resources, building weather shelters, and racing for the highest score. The game board consists of a 9x9 grid with special squares representing natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and storms. Before the game starts, each player chooses a pawn and receives a certain amount of resources. During each turn, the players need to decide which resource they want to focus on to obtain. When a player's pawn lands on a disaster square, they will face a natural disaster or challenge. If they can survive the disaster, they will receive rewards and points. The player who survives the longest and obtains the highest score wins the game.",
