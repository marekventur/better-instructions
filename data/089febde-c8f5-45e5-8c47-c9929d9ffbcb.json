  "instruction": "Design a scientific experiment that could be used to measure the volatility of a certain type of fuel.",
  "input": "Ethanol",
  "output": "A scientific experiment that could be used to measure the volatility of ethanol fuel is a distillation test. This test involves heating the fuel in a distillation apparatus to measure the temperature at which the fuel vaporizes and measuring the temperature at which it condenses back into liquid. The difference between the two temperatures is a measure of the fuel's volatility.",
