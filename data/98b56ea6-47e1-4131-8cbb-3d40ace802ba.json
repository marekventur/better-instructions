  "output": "Design is an important element in any creative task. Whether it's the design of a website, an advertisement, or a simple red apple, its appearance has an impact on how it is perceived. Color, shape, and font all play a role in the way a design is perceived. A good design has the power to grab the attention of the target audience and to encourage them to take action. On the other hand, a poorly designed product or page can be easily overlooked. It is important to pay attention to the details of design to create a creative, eye-catching final product.",
