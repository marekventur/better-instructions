  "output": "John and Sarah had been friends since high school, so when John moved to a different city for work two years ago, they were both sad to see each other go. Now, after two years of being apart, John is back in town for a few weeks and they've agreed to catch up over brunch. When they meet, they catch each other up on all the things that have happened over the last two years - new jobs, new relationships, and so much more. They laugh, joke, and reminisce about the good old days.",
