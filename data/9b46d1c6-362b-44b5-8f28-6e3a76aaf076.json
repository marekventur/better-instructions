  "output": "The skies darken and the wind howls,\nA warning for the sorrowful souls,\nThe clouds rumble and the thunder dreams,\nOf a violent storm on the horizon seas. \n\nThe lightning crackles and the trees shudder,\nThe heavy rainfall wets all with its chatter,\nThe wind blows fierce and roars louder still,\nSpreading terror with its will. \n\nThe storm rages on with no reprieve,\nBringing darkness and fear to believe,\nBut soon it passes, the darkness gone,\nLeaving beauty and joy beneath the sun.",
