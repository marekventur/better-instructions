One day, he stumbled upon a mysterious cat who seemed to know why he was out exploring in the first place. The cat's name was Shadow and it seemed to be guarding something deep within the barn. After some cajoling, Shadow revealed that he was protecting a forgotten magic book with secrets of the magical world. The cat encouraged Lucky to take the book, since the mouse was brave enough to search for his destiny. Lucky accepted the challenge and with the help of Shadow, they set off to explore the magical world.",
