  "output": "The causes of a plane crash can vary greatly, depending on the details of the incident. Aviation experts have identified several potential causes, some related to equipment problems, such as malfunctions or engine failure, and others related to human error, such as pilot fatigue, inadequate training, or miscommunication. Weather conditions can also play a role, with strong winds, mishandled turbulence, or lightning strikes presenting dangers to pilots. Other external factors, such as sabotage, terrorism, and birds or other animals in the plane's path, can contribute to a crash. Ultimately, determining the cause of a plane crash requires a thorough investigation by aviation professionals and experts.",
