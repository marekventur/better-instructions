  "input": "",
  "output": "It is hypothesized that communication skills are essential for success in the workplace because they enable employees to have effective and productive interactions with coworkers, supervisors, clients, and other stakeholders. With strong communication skills, employees can more efficiently convey their ideas and find common ground with those they work with, allowing them to collaborate more effectively. Effective communication also leads to fewer misunderstandings and mistakes, creating a more positive work environment. Ultimately, having well-developed communication skills allows employees to effectively engage in the workplace and be productive in their job roles.",
