  "input": "",
  "output": "A function is a block of code that takes in an input, carries out a set of operations, and returns an output. An algorithm is a sequence of instructions that are used to solve a problem, usually using a series of functions. Algorithms can be executed multiple times with different inputs, while functions are designed to take in specific inputs and provide a specific output. Algorithms also require a clear-cut set of instructions that are followed in order, while functions can be written in any language and can be more flexible in terms of how they are written.",
