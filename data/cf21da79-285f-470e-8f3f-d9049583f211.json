  "output": "The best way to store apples for a longer shelf life is to keep them in a cool, dark, and dry place. A temperature between 30-35\u00b0F (1-2\u00b0C) is optimal. To preserve the natural moisture, place the apples in a breathable container or wrap them in paper towels before putting them in the refrigerator.",
