  "output": "Stuttering, also known as stammering, is a speech disorder that involves involuntary disruptions in speech, such as rhythmic repetitions, pauses, and sound prolongations. People who stutter are unable to form their words with the fluency and ease of speech that others enjoy. The cause of stuttering is not completely understood, but it is known to be a neurological disorder, and can be hereditary. Stuttering can be treated through speech-language therapy, psychological counseling, and even certain medicines.",
