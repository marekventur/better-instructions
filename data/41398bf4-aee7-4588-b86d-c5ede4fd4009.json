  "input": "Go and Python",
  "output": "Go and Python are both open source, cross platform programming languages. Go is a statically typed language, while Python is dynamically typed. Go is compiled directly to machine code, while Python is interpreted. Go is designed to be fast and efficient, while Python has more focus on readability and ease of use. Go has a more structured approach to writing code, while Python provides more freedom in how code is written. Go is more suitable for creating large-scale applications, while Python is more commonly used for creating small programs and scripts.",
