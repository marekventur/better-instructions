  "output": "I had to be diplomatic when dealing with a difficult customer at my previous job. The customer was extremely unhappy with the quality of the product and was demanding a refund. As the company did not have a policy in place to handle such a situation, I had to talk to the customer in a way that was both firm and diplomatic. I consulted with a supervisor and eventually created a solution that allowed the customer to receive a partial refund while allowing the company to maintain its policy.",
