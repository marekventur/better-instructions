  "output": "The four main steps of organic chemistry are isolation, reaction, purification, and characterization. Isolation involves extracting and separating compounds from their natural sources. Reaction refers to the transformation of compounds via chemical or biochemical processes. Purification refers to separating the desired product from any impurities or by-products of the reaction process. Characterization involves determining the structure, purity and identity of the product.",
