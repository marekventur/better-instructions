  "input": "",
  "output": "Some animals have stripes or spots as camouflage while others do not have them since they do not need to hide from predators or danger. For example, tigers have stripes to help them blend in to their environment and make it easier for them to hunt, while other animals like giraffes do not have stripes since they do not need them for camouflage.",
