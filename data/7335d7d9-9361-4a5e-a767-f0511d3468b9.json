  "input": "",
  "output": "Retrieval-based models for natural language processing use pre-defined responses and a scoring system to match the input from the user with the most appropriate response. These models use techniques such as matching, semantic similarity, probability calculation, and sentiment analysis to retrieve the best-matching response from a list of predetermined responses. The response can then be modified by adding words as context, changing the sentence structure, or rephrasing the response, to provide the user with a more natural response. Retrieval-based models are simple to implement and are suitable for tasks such as question-answering and dialog systems.",
