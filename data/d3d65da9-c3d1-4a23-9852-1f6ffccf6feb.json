  "output": "Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, instead of traditional bits to encode information. These qubits can work together in groups, allowing them to process and store data more efficiently than traditional computers. Quantum computers use quantum algorithms to enable them to solve complex problems that would be intractable on classical computers.",
