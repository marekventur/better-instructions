  "output": "Modern technology has revolutionized how people interact with their environment and society, bringing both positive and negative impacts. Positively, technology has led to a more connected world, whereby communication, collaboration and access to information is easier and more efficient than ever before. Increased access to marketplaces has also allowed for greater economic opportunities for individuals and businesses. On the other hand, technology has created a world in which information can be freely shared and manipulated, leading to potential privacy and security risks. Additionally, automation and artificial intelligence are replacing certain manual labour jobs, leading to increased unemployment and income inequality.",
