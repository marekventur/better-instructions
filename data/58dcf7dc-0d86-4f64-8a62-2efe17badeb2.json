  "output": "A plan to reduce the amount of energy used in a home can include a number of steps. First, it is important to minimize the amount of energy-hungry appliances, such as refrigerators, televisions, and chargers. Additionally, energy-efficient light bulbs should be used whenever possible. Programmable thermostats can be used to better regulate the temperature of the home and reduce energy consumption. Homeowners should also look for ways to conserve energy, such as using natural light and reducing water consumption.",
