  "instruction": "Design an AI-based process to detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The AI-based process to detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions should involve data analysis of a variety of aspects, such as customer information, transaction details, merchant details and payment history. The AI process should use algorithms to identify patterns and detect anomalies in the data. These patterns and anomalies can then be used to flag transactions that are suspicious or fraudulent. Additionally, the AI-based process should set customizable thresholds to ensure that unusual transactions are monitored and investigated.",
