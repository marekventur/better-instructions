  "output": "In the 15th century, there was an event that had a major impact on the world - the fall of Constantinople. On May 29th, 1453, the Ottoman army defeated the Byzantine Empire and captured Constantinople, which led to the end of the Roman Empire and a major shift in the geopolitical landscape. Constantinople, once a major center of trade and cultural exchange, fell to the Ottoman Turks and turned into an Islamic city. This marked the beginning of a new era in the globalization of trade and the spread of ideas. The fall of Constantinople was one of the most influential events of the 15th century and is still remembered to this day.",
