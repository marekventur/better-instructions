  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a farmer who lived in a small village by the edge of a jungle. One day, while he was tending to his fields, he was startled by a loud roar. It was a lion, the King of the jungle, who had come to his farm looking for prey. \nThe farmer tried to run away but the lion was too fast. The lion was about to pounce on the poor farmer when suddenly a small mouse ran up to the lion, squeaking loudly. The lion was taken aback by the fearless mouse and decided to spare the farmer's life. Grateful for his life, the farmer thanked the mouse for his bravery and kind heart. From that day onwards, the farmer was always kind and generous to animals, and valued life more than ever.",
