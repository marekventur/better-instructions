  "input": "",
  "output": "Paper-based and digital notes both have their advantages. Paper-based notes can be written anywhere and provide a tangible representation for a person to look back at, whereas digital notes are easier to organize and search through and are more accessible when traveling. Digital notes also provide the opportunity to quickly add multimedia, such as photos and audio recordings. However, paper-based notes can be more reliable as they do not need to rely on an electronic device. Ultimately, the choice between paper and digital notes depends on the personal preference of the user.",
