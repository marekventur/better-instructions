  "instruction": "Determine the outcome of this scenario: A 10 year old is walking on a sidewalk when a youth on a scooter crosses the same sidewalk.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The outcome of this scenario depends on a few factors, such as the speed of the scooter and the youth's awareness of the 10 year old. The 10 year old may get startled and fall if the scooter comes too close or if the youth is not aware of the 10 year old. If the youth is aware and the scooter is traveling at a safe speed, then the 10 year old may be able to safely avoid the scooter.",
