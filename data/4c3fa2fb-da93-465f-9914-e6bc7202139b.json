  "input": "",
  "output": "Naive Bayes Classification is a supervised machine learning technique that uses Bayes Theorem to calculate the probability of a particular outcome given the features in a dataset. The algorithm assumes that each feature is independent of the others and calculates the probability for each separately. The probability of all the features is then combined to form the overall probability, which is used to classify the instance into the corresponding class.",
