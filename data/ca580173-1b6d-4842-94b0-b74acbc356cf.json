  "input": "Reducing emissions from factories could help combat global warming.",
  "output": "Reducing emissions from factories can definitely help with global warming, however, it does not solve the problem. There are many other sources of emissions, such as transport, agriculture and deforestation, that must also be addressed. Therefore, reducing emissions from factories should be part of a comprehensive and holistic approach to mitigating climate change.",
