  "input": "",
  "output": "The Big Bang Theory is the scientific theory that proposes the universe began from a single, extremely dense point around 13.8 billion years ago. This point, known as a singularity, was incredibly hot and rapidly expanded, forming the universe we know today. Two consequential byproducts of the Big Bang were space and time. The Big Bang Theory explains the composition of the universe, the formation of galaxies, and why the universe is still expanding.",
