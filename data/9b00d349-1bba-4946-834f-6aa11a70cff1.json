  "output": "FPGA, ASIC and GPU are different types of integrated circuits that are used in modern electronics. FPGA stands for Field Programmable Gate Array which is a general-purpose integrated circuit that can be programmed to serve specific purposes. ASIC stands for application-specific integrated circuit which is custom-built for a particular application. GPU stands for graphics processing unit which is designed for image processing and accelerated computing. All three have their own distinct characteristics, but all share the same purpose of providing computing power for a given application.",
