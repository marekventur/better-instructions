  "output": "The world is currently facing a daunting challenge due to global warming, and the overconsumption of energy is a major contributing factor. However, there are a few various measures we can take towards reducing the energy we use. The most important step is to raise awareness of the issue to people so they become motivated to take action. Beyond that, people can easily reduce their energy consumption by simple methods such as turning off lights and electronics when not in use, switching to energy efficient lighting and appliances, and unplugging electronics when not in use. Furthermore, using public transportation and carpooling instead of using one's own vehicle can make a big difference. Another way to save energy is by making use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Finally, people can use their spending power to purchase products with highly efficient energy ratings. All of these measures together can make a huge difference in reducing energy consumption and helping to save the planet. If we all take these steps now, we can find a better solution to this problem and create a brighter future.",
