  "instruction": "Imagine you are writing a script for a movie. Describe the house of the main character.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The house of the main character was an old, Victorian-style house nestled between two large oak trees. The paint was peeling and the porch was in need of a good sanding and varnish, but the windows were all in tact and the chimney was intact. To the left of the house was a tall gate - the entrance to the yard full of wildflowers and a large, shady maple tree. The house was surrounded by a few acres of rolling hills and smelled of fresh cut grass and wildflowers. Inside, the house was cozy, with a fireplace in the center of the main room and a few creaky stairs leading up to the bedrooms. The kitchen was old but functional, and it was clear that the house was loved and taken care of as if it were a character itself.",
