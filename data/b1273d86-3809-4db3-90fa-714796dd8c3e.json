  "instruction": "Analyze this situation and provide your thoughts on the best course of action.",
  "input": "Recently, the government passed a new bill to cut taxes on the wealthiest citizens in the country, while raising taxes on the middle and lower class citizens.",
  "output": "This bill puts a burden on some of the most vulnerable citizens in the country, and will lead to increased poverty and inequality. The best course of action is to repeal this bill and replace it with a new bill that provides tax relief to all citizens while also investing in public resources that can help those in need, such as improved education, healthcare, and infrastructure. This will help create a more equal and just society where everyone can thrive.",
