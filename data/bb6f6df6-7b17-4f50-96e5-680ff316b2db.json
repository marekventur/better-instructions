  "input": "",
  "output": "An example of a real-life application of NLP is speech recognition software, such as Siri or Google Assistant. These tools are able to listen to human speech and interpret it, then respond accordingly. NLP is a core component of the speech recognition software, as it enables it to break down the audio into chunks that it can identify, recognize, and interpret. This technology is used in a wide range of applications, from everyday use such as scheduling reminders, to more complex tasks such as identifying keywords in language that can be used to make stock market predictions.",
