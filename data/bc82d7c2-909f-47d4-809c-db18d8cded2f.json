  "output": "A computer system typically consists of four main components: input devices, processing units, output devices, and storage devices. Input devices such as keyboards, mice, and scanners are used to receive information and instructions from the user. Processing units execute the instructions and calculations received at the input level. Output devices, such as monitors and printers, provide processed information in visual or printed form. Storage devices store data and programs used by the computer for future purposes.",
