  "input": "noinput",
  "output": "The term 'algorithm' is derived from the medieval Latin word 'algorismus', and has its roots in ancient times. It was first used by Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in c. 825 AD in his book \"Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabalah\", which introduced the concept of algebra and arithmetic calculations. The term was later adopted by Arabic and Latin scholars, who used it to refer to a set of rules or a set of operations to be performed as part of solving a problem. In the late 1700s, the term was adopted by mathematicians and computer scientists, who used it to describe a set of steps used to solve a problem or accomplish a specific task.",
