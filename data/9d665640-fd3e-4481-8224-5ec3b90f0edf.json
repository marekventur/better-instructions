What did you think of the ending?\nFriend 2: I'm not sure how I feel about it. I thought it was a bit too abrupt, but I think there's still room for the series to continue.\n\nFriend 1: Yeah, I guess that's true. I'm really looking forward to the next installment. What did you think of the characters?\nFriend 2: I thought the characters were pretty dynamic and well-developed. They went through a lot of growth and change, and it was interesting to witness that journey.",
