  "instruction": "Develop a systemfor allocating resources on a limited budget",
  "input": "The system needs to cover 100 people and allocated $1000 budget",
  "output": "A system that allocates resources on a limited budget must consider the needs of each individual, as well as the total budget. A cost-benefit analysis can be implemented to determine the optimal allocation of resources. First, the needs of each individual should be determined. This can be done by asking individual questions and assessing the responses. Then, the budget should be divided among the individuals in a manner that maximizes the total utility, considering both the individual needs and the total budget.",
