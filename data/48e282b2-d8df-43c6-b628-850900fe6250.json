  "input": "",
  "output": "Person 1: Have you seen the show Narcos?\nPerson 2: Yes I have! It's an amazing show, full of great actors, interesting plot and really good acting. What did you think?\nPerson 1: I loved it. The transitions between seasons were seamless and the story kept me on the edge of my seat. I was so invested in the characters, their motives and their arcs as the show went on. I think this show is great for anyone interested in learning about the drug trade without getting immersed in it. \nPerson 2: True. The show also has very complex characters which make it more interesting and intriguing to watch. I can definitely relate to the characters, as well as the moral ambiguity of the story. It was very thought-provoking and captivating!",
