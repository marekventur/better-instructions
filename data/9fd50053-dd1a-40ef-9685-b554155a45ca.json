  "output": "Three methods that can be used for data cleaning are imputation, normalization, and outlier detection. Imputation is the process of replacing missing or invalid data with an estimated value. Normalization refers to the process of restructuring data so that it is more consistent and easier to analyze. Outlier detection is the process of identifying and removing data points that are outside of the normal range.",
