  "input": "",
  "output": "Contextual understanding of language is the ability of a model to understand the meaning of a sentence not only through the words themselves but also through the context in which the words are used. This involves taking into account the relationships between the words, previous sentences, and the topic being discussed in order to gain an understanding of the entire context. It can also involve extracting relevant information from the context in order to make conclusions or provide answers to questions.",
