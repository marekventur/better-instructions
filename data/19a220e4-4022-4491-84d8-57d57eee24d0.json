  "input": "",
  "output": "The key components of a database management system (DBMS) include a data dictionary, a query processor, a database engine, a database schema, a database administrator, and a database security system. A data dictionary is used to store information about the database, such as table names, field names, and field attributes. The query processor is used to process SQL queries and return the requested information. The database engine is responsible for maintaining the database by accessing and manipulating data stored in the tables. The database schema defines relationships between the various database tables and helps to ensure data integrity. The database administrator is responsible for setting up and maintaining the database. Finally, the database security system ensures that unauthorized access is prevented and only authorized users have access to restricted information.",
