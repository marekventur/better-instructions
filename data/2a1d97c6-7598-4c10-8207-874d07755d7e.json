  "instruction": "Describe what cloud computing is in a few sentences.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Cloud computing is a type of computing that relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications. A cloud provider hosts the infrastructure, platform and software tools necessary for organizations to access computing resources on demand. Cloud computing allows organizations to tap into shared resources for IT needs, simplifying processes such as data storage and recovery.  Additionally, organizations can outsource services, such as file sharing and application serving, to a cloud service provider, which reduces cost and the complexity of having to manage systems in-house.",
