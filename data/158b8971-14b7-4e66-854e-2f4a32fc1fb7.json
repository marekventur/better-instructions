  "input": "",
  "output": "The program should start by outlining the purpose and goals of the drone use. This should include regulations for safe and responsible use. The program should ensure that all operators are properly trained and licensed. The program should also establish clear guidelines for drone use in areas with people or buildings, such as no-fly zones, altitude limits, and other safety measures. Finally, there should be regular safety checks and maintenance for drones for ensuring that the drones remain in safe and reliable condition.",
