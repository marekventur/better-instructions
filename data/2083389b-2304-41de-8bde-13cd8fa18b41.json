  "input": "",
  "output": "Data Science plays an important role in AI-enabled decision making by providing the data and insights that enable AI systems to accurately identify patterns, trends and causal relationships. This allows the AI systems to understand the current context and to predict how an action may affect the outcome. Furthermore, it enables the AI system to better understand how variables are connected and therefore to make better decisions.",
