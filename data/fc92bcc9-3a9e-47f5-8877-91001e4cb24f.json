  "input": "",
  "output": "Parallel computing is a computing technique that divides a large task into several smaller tasks, and then allocates each task to a separate processor or computer, allowing the tasks to be executed simultaneously. This makes it possible to complete complex computations and data processing tasks in a fraction of the time compared to sequential computing.",
