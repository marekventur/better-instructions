The inhabitants have often fled from conflict or persecution and have limited access to basic services, medical care, and sanitation. Food, water, clothing and shelter are often scarce and living conditions can be uncomfortable or unsafe. Without adequate protection, refugees can be vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.",
