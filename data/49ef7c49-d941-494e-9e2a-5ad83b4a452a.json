  "output": "The best way to conduct an interview is to create an environment that is comfortable and welcoming for the candidate. A successful interview should be an engaging conversation, rather than a one-sided interrogation. Questions should be tailored specifically to the role and you should give the candidate enough time to answer. Additionally, it's important to listen to the candidate's answers and provide constructive feedback when needed.",
