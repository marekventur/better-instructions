  "output": "The latest development related to global warming is that the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere is currently the highest it has been in the past 800,000 years. This is due to the burning of fossil fuels over the last two centuries, resulting in an increase in atmospheric CO2 levels by more than 40%. As global temperatures rise, the potential impacts of climate change become more severe, including more extreme weather events and a decrease in biodiversity.",
