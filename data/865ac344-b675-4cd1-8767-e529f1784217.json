  "output": "Bot Superball is a team sport played on a large, enclosed court, similar to a basketball court. The teams consist of four players and two self-powered robotic balls that move along the court. The players must use a combination of their individual skills and team strategy to outplay the opponent and drive their robotic balls into the goal, located at each end of the court. The robots are controlled manually by the players, who must position themselves in such a way that they can observe and control them from a distance. The robotic balls move automatically and can surprise the players with sudden acceleration or direction changes. The team with the most goals at the end of the game is the winner.",
