  "input": "",
  "output": "Open source software has a number of advantages. It is typically available for free and allows users to customize the code to suit their own needs. This makes it useful for developers and users who may want to add new features to the software or make changes for specific purposes. Additionally, open source software is often more secure than proprietary or closed source software because it has a large community of developers who can quickly identify and fix security flaws. Open source software also makes it easier for developers to collaborate and develop innovative solutions that are more easily reusable.",
