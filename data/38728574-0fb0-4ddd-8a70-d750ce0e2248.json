  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial neural networks are the most commonly used deep learning models because they are able to approximate non-linear functions. They structure their operations as a network of nodes and can accurately process complex data inputs more accurately than traditional machine learning algorithms. Additionally, they have the ability to self-adjust their parameters, making them better able to understand and learn from complex data.",
