  "input": "Impostor Syndrome",
  "output": "Impostor Syndrome is a psychological phenomenon where an individual feels overwhelmed by self-doubt and insecurity despite the accomplishments and successes that have been achieved. It is marked by an internalized fear of not being good enough and feeling like a liar or a fraud. It can affect professionals and students of all backgrounds, genders, and ages and can be particularly damaging to one's mental and emotional well-being if it's not addressed. It is important to be aware of the potential risks of impostor syndrome and to develop strategies to overcome feelings of self-doubt.",
