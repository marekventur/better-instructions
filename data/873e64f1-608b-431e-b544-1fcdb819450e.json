  "output": "Verse 1:\nI can\u2019t just let go, of what we used to know\nWe built a future, something perfect and true\nBut I can\u2019t ignore, what\u2019s written on the floor\nIt\u2019s time to leave the past, and all we\u2019ve gone through\n\nChorus:\nI know it\u2019s hard to move on, but I believe in us\nWe must try and find, a way to keep our love\nSo I will take it slow, and feel what I must go\nFor even though it hurts, I know it\u2019s only us\n\nVerse 2:\nSince I know I can\u2019t pretend, I must believe this is the end\nWe loved with all we had, never held nothing back\nBut I can see it clear, although I still have fear\nThat this is not our way, to keep the path that\u2019s on track\n\nChorus:\nI know it\u2019s hard to move on, but I believe in us\nWe must try and find, a way to keep our love\nSo I will take it slow, and feel what I must go\nFor even though it hurts, I know it\u2019s only us\n\nBridge:\nAs I swallow what must be, I go above the sea\nThe light to guide the way, the love will never fade\nAnd I will stay, to try and make it through\n\nChorus:\nI know it\u2019s hard to move on, but I believe in us\nWe must try and find, a way to keep our love\nSo I will take it slow, and feel what I must go\nFor even though it hurts, I know it\u2019s only us",
