  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between electromagnetic and gravitational waves is their source. Electromagnetic waves, such as light, are generated by electric and magnetic fields. Gravitational waves are generated by the acceleration of mass, such as when two black holes collide. Electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light while gravitational waves travel at the speed of gravity. Electromagnetic waves can be reflected, refracted or absorbed while gravitational waves can only be absorbed.",
