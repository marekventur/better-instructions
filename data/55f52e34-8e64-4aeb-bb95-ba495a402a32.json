  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had a small farming plot in the countryside. One day, while he was tending to his crops, he noticed a fox lurking around the edge of his farm. Attempting to scare the fox away, the farmer ran towards the animal, yelling and waving his arms. The fox ran away and the farmer continued to tend to his crops. The fox returned the next day, however, despite the farmer\u2019s repeated attempts to scare it away. This time, rather than running, the fox sat and watched the farmer. After a few moments, the fox disappeared into the woods, never to be seen again.",
