  "output": "One of the most effective methods for managing time is to break down larger tasks into smaller, achievable goals. It is important to set realistic goals and deadlines for completing them, so that progress can be monitored and any issues can be identified and addressed quickly. Scheduling regular breaks can help to maintain focus as well as manage fatigue and stress. Additionally, it can be useful to develop a routine so that certain tasks can be completed each day, allowing for better time-management overall.",
