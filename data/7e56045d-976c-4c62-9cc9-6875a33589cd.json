  "instruction": "Explain the environmental impacts of single-use plastics",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Single-use plastics have severe environmental impacts mainly because they are made from fossil fuels, and their production and consumption generates large amounts of greenhouse gases. Additionally, since single-use plastics are not biodegradable, they remain in the environment for hundreds of years, releasing toxic chemicals and absorbing chemicals like DDT. Single-use plastics are a major source of ocean pollution and cause harm to marine life. They are also a major source of microplastic pollution, which is increasingly becoming a problem for all water sources, including lakes, rivers, and groundwater.",
