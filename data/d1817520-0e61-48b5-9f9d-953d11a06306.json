  "input": "",
  "output": "Banning plastic straws is an essential step in preserving our planet's future. Single use plastic straws are a major contributor to plastic pollution, as it takes hundreds of years for them to degrade and they damage natural ecosystems. Furthermore, plastic straws are unnecessary, as there are plenty of more sustainable alternatives such as bamboo, paper, and stainless steel. By banishing plastic straws, we can keep the environment clean and protected for future generations.",
