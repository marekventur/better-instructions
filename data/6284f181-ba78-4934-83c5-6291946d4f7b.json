It produces several green, leathery leaves which remain on the tree through most of the year and can reach lengths of up to 10 cm. The leaves are also well suited to collect moisture and are often found near rivers and other water sources. Additionally, the Banyan tree is known for its remarkable longevity, with some trees estimated to be over 200 years old.",
