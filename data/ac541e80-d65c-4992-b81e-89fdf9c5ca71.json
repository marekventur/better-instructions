  "output": "The human brain is highly complex, and the process of how it compiles thoughts and feelings is still being studied and explored. According to Scientific American, the mental processes of thought and feeling involve the interaction of neurons and the flow of neurotransmitters. Psychology Today suggests this process is shaped by an individual's experience, including memories and emotions, as well as the way the brain is wired to form connections between these elements. These connections form the basis for thought, emotion, and ultimately for the ability to communicate and interact with others.",
