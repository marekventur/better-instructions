  "instruction": "Describe how an aerosol spray works.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An aerosol spray works by releasing a pressurized liquid or gas through a nozzle. This pressurization could be generated either by a propellant gas contained in the can, or by the user manually pumping the nozzle. When the substance passes through the nozzle at high speeds, it creates tiny droplets or particles that are released into the atmosphere. The size and quantity of these particles depend on the type of aerosol spray, the amount of liquid released, and the nozzle size. These particles can either settle on surfaces or float in the air, depending on their size and amount.",
