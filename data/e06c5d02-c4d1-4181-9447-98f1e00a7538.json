  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change has had a major impact on the agricultural sector in developing countries. Warmer temperatures, an increase in extreme weather events, and changes in precipitation patterns have caused increased droughts and flooding, leading to reduced crop yields and increased food insecurity in many developing countries. Changes in climate have also led to increased pest infestations, which have caused major losses for farmers. In addition, changes in the environment have caused many crops to become less resilient, making them more vulnerable to changes in climate and disease. As a result, many developing countries are struggling to keep up with the demands of growing populations and climate change.",
