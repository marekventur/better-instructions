  "output": "Verse 1:\nOh what a shame, what a pity\nThe Earth is slowly changing\nBut the animals, they bear no blame\nAnd nature's slowly fading\n\nChorus:\nEndangered species, will we ever see them again?\nNo one knows, the future is uncertain\nWe need to act now, to save these beautiful creatures\nWe need to protect them, set them free\n\nVerse 2:\nLet's be kind and do all we can\nHelp to bring a change in this land\nStop the deforestation, clear the sea\nAnd our planet will be healthy\n\nChorus:\nEndangered species, will we ever see them again?\nNo one knows, the future is uncertain \nWe need to act now, to save these beautiful creatures\nWe need to protect them, set them free\n\nOutro:\nLet us take the lead, not be the victims\nSave the living, save the future, be the guardians \nEndangered species, they need us here\nLet's make the world a better place and set them free.",
