  "output": "An adaptive user interface is one that is able to change its layout, design, and/or content based on the user input, preferences, and environment. It is designed to help users navigate, search, and interact with a website or application more efficiently. Adaptive user interfaces use data collected on user behavior to adjust and personalize the interface for each user. \n\nSome of the features of an adaptive user interface include adjustable screen sizes, personalized homepages, intelligent search features, and adaptive content layout. Adaptive user interfaces are designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with features that make it easier for users to find what they need without having to hunt through multiple pages or menus. Adaptive user interfaces also have the ability to remember user preferences and settings, which means they will offer personalized experiences even if the user has been away from the website or application.",
