  "output": "Verse 1\nI'm feeling lost and so confused,\nGoing in circles, I'm starting to lose\nThe courage I had and my enthusiasm,\nBetween the confusion and the indifference\n\nChorus:\nOne step forward and two steps back, \nCan\u2019t find my way and it's just a fact\n\nVerse 2\nMy desire for success, it's not in doubt\nBut I can't seem to make anything work out\nStuck in this game, that's just too hard\nBetween giving up and reaching for the stars\n\nChorus:\nOne step forward and two steps back, \nCan\u2019t find my way and it's just a fact\n\nBridge:\nIf I just keep trying, if I keep moving ahead\nI know I can make it, can learn what I need\n\nChorus\nOne step forward and two steps back, \nCan\u2019t find my way and it's just a fact",
