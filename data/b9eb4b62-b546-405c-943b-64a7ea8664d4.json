  "input": "",
  "output": "Monsoons are seasonal reverse winds accompanied by heavy rainfall. Monsoons take place over tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They are caused by surface temperature changes creating pressure differentials and an atmospheric circulation which directs the winds to bring humid air from the ocean over land. This results in high levels of precipitation in the affected areas, lasting several weeks or months. The favorable season for monsoons usually lasts from June to September.",
