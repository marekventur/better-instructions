  "input": "",
  "output": "Raising the minimum wage could have a variety of economic effects. It could lead to an increase in consumer spending, because workers would have more disposable income to buy goods and services. It could also lead to an increase in labor costs for businesses, resulting in higher prices for goods and services. In addition, it could lead to job losses, as some employers may be unable to afford the higher labor costs.",
