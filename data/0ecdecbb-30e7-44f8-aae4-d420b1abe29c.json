  "input": "",
  "output": "Four advantages of distributed systems are scalability, performance, fault tolerance, and cost-efficiency. \n\nDistributed systems can be easily scaled to meet growing demands by adding more computing resources as needed. This allows for a high level of availability, as well as faster processing speeds, as the workload can be split over multiple machines. \n\nAdditionally, distributed systems provide fault tolerance, as the work can be spread across multiple machines. If one machine fails, the rest of the system can still operate and prevent extended downtime. \n\nLastly, distributed systems are cost-efficient, as the workload can be split over multiple machines, resulting in lower hardware costs. Furthermore, distributed systems can take advantage of cloud computing technologies, resulting in lower operational costs and minimizing upfront investments.",
