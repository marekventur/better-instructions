  "input": "",
  "output": "The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth. It occurs when sunlight passes through the atmosphere and is absorbed by the Earth's surface. The Earth's surface then radiates the energy back into the atmosphere as infrared radiation. The gases in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor absorb this infrared radiation, trapping the heat in the atmosphere and keeping the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere warm.",
