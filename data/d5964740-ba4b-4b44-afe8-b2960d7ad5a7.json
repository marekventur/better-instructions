  "output": "The May 4th Massacre occurred in Tiananmen Square on May 4th, 1989. The event was part of the longer Chinese pro-democracy movement and occurred in response to the death of Hu Yaobang, a liberal party official. As a result of the event, roughly 10,000 student protesters and ordinary citizens gathered in the square, leading to clashes between protestors and government soldiers. The government responded with violence and reportedly killed hundreds, if not more than 1000, protestors. The incident sparked international outrage, leading to economic sanctions on China.",
