  "output": "In order to build a custom gaming computer, you will need several components. This will include the CPU (Central Processing Unit), a good CPU cooler, RAM (Random Access Memory), a motherboard to run it all, a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), a storage device such as an SSD (Solid State Drive) for faster loading times, a power supply unit to provide your computer with the necessary power, a gaming case, and appropriate cables. You will also need to consider cooling, such as fans and liquid cooling systems, as well as any necessary peripherals such as a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.",
