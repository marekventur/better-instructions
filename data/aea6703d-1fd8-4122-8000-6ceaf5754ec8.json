  "input": "Gender",
  "output": "Gender can have an impact on statistical analysis results, depending on the type of analysis conducted and the context of the data. For example, in marketing research, gender may impact the responses to survey questions in terms of the language used or topics discussed. In scientific research, gender may affect experimental results based on the biological characteristics of each gender. Additionally, gender may also be a moderating variable when researching the impact of another variable, such as social media usage or productivity.",
