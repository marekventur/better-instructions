  "output": "The consequences of global warming will be far-reaching and devastating. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events will threaten coastal cities across the world. Higher temperatures will bring more droughts, floods, and extreme weather events, leading to food and water shortages, decreased crop yields, and losses of biodiversity. Human health will also be negatively impacted, with an increased risk of heat stroke, infectious diseases, and air pollution-related illnesses.",
