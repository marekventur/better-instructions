  "input": "",
  "output": "Vincent Van Gogh and Jackson Pollock are two of the most iconic figures of modern art. While they share a passion for nature and a fascination with colors, their artistic styles could not be more different. Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s work is characterized by his use of vivid colors and expressive brushwork, as seen in his works such as The Starry Night. Jackson Pollock, on the other hand, was more interested in creating abstract works of art with an emphasis on gesture and spontaneity, most famously expressed in his drip paintings. While both artists have had a lasting impact on the art world, their style and approach are distinctly different.",
