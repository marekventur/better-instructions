  "input": "",
  "output": "An online club meeting is significantly different from an in-person club meeting. An online meeting allows members to convene from any location, supporting anytime accessibility and saving time and money associated with travel. It also allows for larger crowds, as well as members who may feel apprehensive about showing their faces in person. Unfortunately, however, an online meeting does not have the same level of intimacy as an in-person meeting, as there are many distractions that can easily draw a person\u2019s attention away from the conversation. Additionally, online meetings cannot provide members with a tactile experience, such as sharing a project or passing around an object to inspect or demonstrate.",
