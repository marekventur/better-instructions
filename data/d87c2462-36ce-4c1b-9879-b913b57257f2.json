  "instruction": "Write a code for a web scrapping tool",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A code for a web scraping tool would involve writing a script in a language such as Python to access and process HTML data from webpages. The script could use requests to send an HTTP request to a particular webpage and Beautiful Soup to extract the HTML elements from the webpage. Once the HTML elements have been extracted, the data can be filtered and processed according to the requirements. Additionally, the code could use library functions such as Selenium or PhantomJS to facilitate the web scraping process.",
