  "output": "Good morning everyone. Today I'm here to talk about some of the current trends in AI technology. \n\nAI technology has made incredible advances in many areas. It has been used to help doctors detect diseases, to optimize traffic flow, and to develop autonomous vehicles. AI is becoming more and more powerful as advances are made in machine learning and natural language processing.\n\nOne of the most interesting current trends in AI technology is its use in personal assistants. AI-driven virtual assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, can be used to answer questions, do research, make purchases, and manage schedules. These virtual assistants are continually learning new skills, and they are becoming increasingly advanced.\n\nAnother trend in AI is the development of robots that have human-like capabilities. These robots are being developed in order to do tasks that are too difficult or dangerous for humans, such as exploring hazardous environments or performing medical operations. \n\nFinally, AI-enabled computers are also being used to create artificial intelligence-based content, such as news articles and videos. This technology has great potential in areas such as education, entertainment, and journalism.\n\nIn conclusion, AI technology is making tremendous progress, and these advances will continue to shape the future of our world. Thank you.",
