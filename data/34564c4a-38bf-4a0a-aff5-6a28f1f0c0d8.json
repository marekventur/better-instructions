The delegates discussed a wide array of issues such as labor rights, navigation-rights, taxation, the representation of states in Congress and the form of the federal government. The convention concluded after four long months with the signing of the Constitution on September 17th. The document was then sent to the states for their respective ratifications. During the two years between then and now, the ultimate federal government was determined, and the Constitution was ratified by all thirteen states.",
