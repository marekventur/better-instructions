  "output": "A budgeting plan is a great way to manage your finances and stay within your means. It involves setting a fixed monthly budget for all your expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries,etc., and determining how much you can afford to save. \n\nThe key to a successful budgeting plan is to be realistic and adjust your budget as needed. Track all your expenses so that you know how much you are spending and where your money is going. Cut unnecessary expenses and look for ways to save money on the things you need. Periodically review and make modifications to your budget as needed.",
