  "input": "",
  "output": "The painting styles of Monet and Van Gogh differ in the way they depict color, texture, and the subjects they feature. Monet's paintings are known for their soft, hazy appearance, using subtle colors and gentle brushstrokes. Van Gogh, on the other hand, often used energetic brushstrokes and bright colors in his artwork, creating highly expressive scenes. Monet often captured everyday scenes with a focus on light and atmosphere, whereas Van Gogh often incorporated intense emotion in his paintings which featured night scenes, rural landscapes, and portraits of common people.",
