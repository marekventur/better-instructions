  "input": "",
  "output": "Normalization is the process of organizing and streamlining data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. In this process, data is organized into related tables and fields, and column values are broken down and structured into separate, related tables. Normalization also involves the elimination of repeating data, replacing it with a foreign key to other tables in the database. The purpose of normalization is to make it easy for people to understand the structure of the database and make it easier to add, delete, and update data.",
