  "input": "",
  "output": "International trade has been integral to the growth and success of capitalism. It allows countries to access goods, services, and resources that they would not otherwise have access to, increasing economic efficiency and productivity. It also allows for greater specialization in industries, with each country focusing on producing the goods or services that it is best suited for, and trading those goods or services with other countries. Furthermore, international trade has allowed for the emergence of global markets, facilitating greater competition and increasing incentive for efficiency on the part of businesses.",
