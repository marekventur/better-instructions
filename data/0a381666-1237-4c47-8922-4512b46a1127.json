  "output": "Planning a virtual birthday party for a 10 year old can be fun and creative. Start by picking a theme, such as a movie night or a scavenger hunt. Send out digital invitations and give everyone a designated time to log on. Create a playlist with their favorite songs, and make sure to format the party with interactive games, such as charades and virtual bingo. To make the experience even more special, send out party packs with virtual decorations, games, and snacks. Most importantly, don't forget to give the birthday person all the attention and set the tone for a memorable celebration.",
