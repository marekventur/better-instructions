  "input": "",
  "output": "A Learning Management System (LMS) and Course Management System (CMS) are both tools used to deliver online education. However, they have some key differences. An LMS is a more comprehensive platform with features such as student tracking and assessment, while a CMS focuses more on content delivery. An LMS is also typically used for larger courses that need more advanced tracking and monitoring, while a CMS is often used for smaller classes with a relatively simple content delivery structure.",
