  "output": "In \"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,\" the narrator exhorts his father not to give in to death but to fight against it. He argues that old age and mortality should be embraced with dignity, anger, and strength rather than accepted reluctantly. He urges his father to be wild and to never accept life's inevitability, to never give in to the dark night. In the poem's conclusion, the narrator is revealed to be speaking to his father in the final moments of his life, and the narrator implores his father to live despite the darkness.",
