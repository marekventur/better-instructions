  "input": "No input",
  "output": "A comprehensive strategy to prevent cyberbullying online must begin with education. Schools, parents, and community organizations should provide children and young people with the skills to recognize when they or their peers are being cyberbullied and to respond safely. Additionally, children and young people should be taught how to responsibly use the internet and its various platforms, such as social media, so that they understand how their words and actions online can have consequences. It is also essential to have clear guidelines and rules in place that forbid cyberbullying and explain the consequences of breaking these rules.\n\nAdditionally, clear procedures should be established for reporting and responding to cyberbullying incidents. These procedures should be easily accessible, so that individuals can make use of them without fear of repercussion if they are being cyberbullied. Lastly, it is important to provide a safe and secure means for those being cyberbullied to reach out for help. Hotlines and other forms of support should be made available and highly visible.",
