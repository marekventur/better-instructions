  "output": "Mean is a measure of the average value of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding up all of the values in the set and dividing by the total number of values in the set. \nMedian is a measure of the center of a set of numbers. It is the middle number of the set when the set is ordered numerically. If there is an even number of values in the set, the median is the average of the two middle values.\nMode is a measure of the most commonly occurring value in a set of numbers. It is the value that occurs with the highest frequency in the set. If there is more than one value that occurs with the same frequency, then all of those values are considered modes.",
