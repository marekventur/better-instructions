  "input": "",
  "output": "Habitability refers to the livability of a space, or how comfortable and enjoyable it is to live in. This covers everything from structural integrity and air quality to natural light, size, noise level, and access to fresh air. Architects should consider habitability when they design buildings because it not only affects the quality of life for people living or working there, but also contributes to the overall aesthetic of the space. Good design also ensures that buildings are in line with regulations and built to last. Good habitability also encourages people to spend time in the space, since it is physically and psychologically conducive to doing so. In short, architects must factor in all the elements that create a comfortable and livable environment when designing a building.",
