  "input": "",
  "output": "Inherited traits are characteristics that are passed down from parent to offspring and are determined by genes. Learned behaviors, on the other hand, are behaviors that are acquired by an individual based on habits, environment and experiences. Inherited traits are typically not influenced by the environment, while learned behaviors are heavily influenced by environmental factors. Inherited traits can include physical characteristics, such as eye color, or mental characteristics, such as personality traits. Learned behaviors, on the other hand, can range from skills, such as playing an instrument or driving a car, to more complex behaviors, such as language acquisition or morality.",
