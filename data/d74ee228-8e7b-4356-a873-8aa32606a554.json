  "input": "Noinput",
  "output": "The animation shows the process of condensation. As air cools, the water molecules in the air form droplets which collect on objects like window panes, forming tiny water droplets. Over time, the droplets form larger drops and the water droplets eventually merge, creating a thin layer of liquid. This process is an example of condensation and is an important part of the water cycle.",
