  "input": "",
  "output": "Active transport is the process by which molecules move across cell membranes with the help of energy from the cell. This energy may come from ATP or other chemical sources. Active transport requires energy to move molecules against their concentration gradient, while passive transport does not require energy and is driven by the concentration gradient of the molecules. \n\nAdditionally, active transport occurs mainly at specific destinations, such as organelles, while passive transport occurs randomly. Active transport also generally moves large molecules, while passive transport moves small molecules.",
