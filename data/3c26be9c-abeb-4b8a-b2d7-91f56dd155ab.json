  "output": "The best qualities of a teacher are often those that are intangible and difficult to quantify, such as patience and a passion for teaching. The best teachers lead by example, demonstrating a genuine commitment to the growth and development of the students in their care. Great teachers are always encouraging and supportive, creating a safe and welcoming learning environment. They are also able to recognize individual differences and cater teaching to a variety of learning styles. Strong communication skills and experience in the subject matter being taught also make great teachers. Above all, a great teacher understands that every student is unique, and can challenge and inspire them to reach their fullest potential.",
