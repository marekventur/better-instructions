  "output": "My concept for a new company is a online marketplace that connects small businesses from around the world with experts from other industries who can provide strategic advice and resources. This platform would enable small businesses to take advantage of the experience and knowledge of larger, more established companies. By connecting customers, sellers, and experts, this platform would help small businesses succeed and make a impact in their local or global markets.",
