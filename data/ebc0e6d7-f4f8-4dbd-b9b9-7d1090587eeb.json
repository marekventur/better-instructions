  "input": "",
  "output": "Grammar checkers and spell checkers are both software tools used to improve the accuracy of writing. A spell checker checks for typos, incorrectly spelled words, and incorrect capitalization, but it cannot identify grammar mistakes. A grammar checker, on the other hand, will identify errors with sentence structure and word order, which a spell checker cannot detect. Both tools can be used together to create more accurate writing, but a grammar checker is the only tool capable of detecting errors related to grammar.",
