Under the Factories Act of 1948, children under the age of 14 cannot be employed in factories, and all workers have legally mandated rest days and entitlements for overtime and bonus payments. In addition, the Minimum Wages Act of 1948 provides for workers to be paid based on the skills and qualifications that they bring. Furthermore, the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act of 2013 protects women from any form of sexual harassment or discrimination in the workplace. In addition to this, Universal Peace Education Act, 1993 provides protection to women and girls working in hazardous conditions.",
