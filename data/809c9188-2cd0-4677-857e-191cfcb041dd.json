  "input": "Smartwatch",
  "output": "A potential use case for a smartwatch is monitoring patient health. The watch would be able to track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and other important metrics that can indicate changes in a patient's health. The data would be stored and used to detect any changes in the patient's condition over time, allowing for quick action to be taken if needed.",
