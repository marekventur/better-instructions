  "instruction": "Design a categorization scheme for the different types of animals.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Animals can be categorized into different taxonomic groups, such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, arthropods and more. Within these groups, animals can be further sorted into subcategories based on size, environment, diet, behavior, and life cycle. For example, mammals can be divided into smaller categories such as marsupials, pinnipeds, deer and bovines. Similarly, fish can be sorted into larger categories including cartilaginous fish, ray-finned fish, sharks, and eels.\n\nThis categorization scheme can be further refined to even more specific divisions, such as primates, rodents and predators. This type of categorization provides a structure to better understand the relationships between different types of animals and their unique characteristics.",
