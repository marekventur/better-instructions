  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a talking mouse who lived in the forest near an elephant sanctuary. The mouse was very curious about the elephants and would talk to them every day. One day, the mouse asked the elephant, \u201cWhy are you so big and strong?\u201d The elephant chuckled and said, \u201cI'm big and strong because I'm brave enough to explore and try new things.\u201d The mouse thought about this for a while and decided to be brave and explore too. From then on, the mouse and the elephant were the best of friends.",
