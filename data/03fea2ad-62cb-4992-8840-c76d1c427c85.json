  "input": "No input required.",
  "output": "In programming, a type is a classification of data that dictates how different elements can be interacted with and used. Types define how computer programs interpret and display information, such as numbers, Booleans, strings, arrays, and objects. They also determine the behavior and output of certain operations and functions. Having standard types which all programming languages use allows for communication and compatibility between different programming languages.",
