  "output": "A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology that is used to record data securely across a peer-to-peer network. It stores and encrypts data into blocks that are linked together in a chronological order. This makes the data immutable and resistant to tampering. Benefits of blockchain technology include increased security, improved data accuracy, lower costs, and faster transactions. It can also be used to facilitate a variety of applications such as smart contracts, cryptocurrency transactions, and secure web hosting services.",
