  "output": "Person 1: Have you been researching tour packages in New York City? \nPerson 2: Yes, I\u2019ve been looking at some of the options online. There seem to be a lot of different tours available, but it\u2019s hard to pick one. \nPerson 1: You should look at reviews to see if the tour offers what you\u2019re looking for. I\u2019ve heard great things about the all-encompassing city tour that takes you to all the famous sights.\nPerson 2: What about the cultural walking tour? I\u2019ve read a lot about it, and it seems like a great option. \nPerson 1: That\u2019s a great tour! It takes you through all the boroughs and explains the history of the city. You can also customize your tour to focus on the areas you want to explore most. \nPerson 2: That sounds amazing. I think I\u2019ll give it a try!",
