  "output": "The Theory of Evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin, states that organism evolved over time from common ancestors through the process of natural selection. This process involves the passing on of beneficial traits from one generation to the next. Natural selection occurs when organisms with the most beneficial traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, thus passing on those same beneficial traits. Through this process, organisms gradually become better adapted to their environment and over time, new species can form. Natural selection and the Theory of Evolution are supported by a multitude of scientific evidence and is essential to understanding how organisms and species evolve.",
