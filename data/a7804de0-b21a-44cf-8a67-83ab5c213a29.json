  "instruction": "Explain what causes a thunderstorm.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A thunderstorm is caused by the rapid rising of warm, moist air. This forces the air to cool, causing it to condense and form droplets of water that mix with dust particles. When these particles collide, they create electric charges, which accumulate and form lightning. The rapid expansion of air that results from the lightning causes the thunder.",
