  "input": "",
  "output": "Scientists use chemical bonds to describe the ways in which atoms combine to form molecules. Chemical bonds occur when two or more atoms share or exchange electrons in order to form a stable arrangement. These bonds are responsible for many of the properties and reactions of a chemical compound, and are used by scientists to predict how a compound will react with others.",
