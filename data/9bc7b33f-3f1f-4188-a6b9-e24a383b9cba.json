  "output": "A perfect weekend getaway would involve traveling to a remote location, surrounded by nature. The ideal settings would include a beach, mountains, and forests, providing the opportunity to explore and relax. During the daytime, you could hike or kayak, discovering the surrounding area and taking in the scenery. As night falls, you can spend time around a bonfire, watching the stars, and listening to the beautiful sounds of nature.",
