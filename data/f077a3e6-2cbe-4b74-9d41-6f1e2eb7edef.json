  "output": "John had been feeling down for weeks but he never expected it to get this bad. His mind felt dull and empty, and his heart felt as though it was made of lead. He found himself unable to think of anything beyond his despair. No matter how much he tried, he just could not muster the motivation to do anything. He had become a shell of his former self. \nOne day, he decided that he needed to do something to get out of his slump. He got on his bike and started riding out of town. He found himself heading towards the old park he used to go to as a child. As he rode, the air around him filled with the sweet smell of blooming flowers, and a light breeze carried the distant sound of laughter. \nJohn smiled for the first time in weeks. Perhaps, he thought, things will be alright.",
