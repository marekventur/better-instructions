  "input": "",
  "output": "Email and telephone are two communication methods that are used to stay connected. Email is a technology based, written communication method that typically allows a person to send a message to multiple people at once; whereas, telephone is a voice-based communication method which is used to talk one-on-one with a specific individual. Email is great for quickly sending a general message, while phone calls are better for more in-depth conversations.",
