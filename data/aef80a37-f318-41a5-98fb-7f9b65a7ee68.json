  "instruction": "Find the angle of elevation when a ball is thrown with an initial velocity of 15 m/s at an angle of 45 degrees.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The angle of elevation is 62.68 degrees. This is calculated by finding the quadratic formula of resulting velocity in two dimensions, v = 15cos45i + 15sin45j and then finding the angle of elevation by taking inverse tangent of the vertical over the horizontal ratio (y/x) which is sin62.68 = vy / v.",
