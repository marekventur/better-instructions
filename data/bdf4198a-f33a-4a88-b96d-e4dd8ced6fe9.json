  "input": "",
  "output": "The rule of three in economics states that a market is more competitive when the number of firms competing in the market is three or more. This is because when there are three firms, none of them has the power to control prices or otherwise influence the behavior of the other two. The rule of three is a simplification of the more general Cournot duopoly model, which states that firms will tend to set prices and output quantities based on an expectation of how the other firms in the market will behave.",
