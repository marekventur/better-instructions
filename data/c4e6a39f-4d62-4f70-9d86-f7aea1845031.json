  "input": "",
  "output": "Human activities are the main driver of climate change. Human-induced climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels and other activities that increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat and make the earth warmer, leading to rising temperatures and other changes in the climate. This causes changes in weather patterns, melting of glaciers and ice sheets, rising sea levels, and other impacts.",
