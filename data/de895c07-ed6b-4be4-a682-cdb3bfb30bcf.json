  "instruction": "Explain why the 9th Amendment to the US Constitution is important.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The 9th Amendment to the US Constitution is important because it reinforces the principle that the Bill of Rights is not a complete list of the rights of all citizens. It states that the enumeration of certain rights in the Constitution shall not be construed to deny or disparage other rights retained by the people. This means that the Constitution protects other rights not explicitly stated in the Bill of Rights.",
