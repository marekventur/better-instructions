  "output": "1. Utilize natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to search for repeated phrases or sentences in documents.\n2. Utilize machine learning algorithms to create a model to detect changes in writing style or structure. \n3. Develop algorithms to compare the language used in documents to detect similarities in writing structures and vocabularies.\n4. Develop algorithms to analyze the citation of sources places in documents to locate any inconsistencies.\n5. Develop algorithms to search for the presence of similar content from webpages and other external sources.\n6. Utilize image recognition algorithms to search for the presence of identical graphics or diagrams.\n7. Utilize algorithms to check for the presence of copied content from other sources.\n8. Utilize algorithms to track the history of documents and check for any signs of tampering.\n9. Utilize audio recognition algorithms to detect similarities in audio recordings and files.\n10. Utilize algorithms to compare sections of code from different programming languages and detect copied code.",
