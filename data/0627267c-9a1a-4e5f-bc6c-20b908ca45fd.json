  "output": "The algorithm for computing the factorial of a number is as follows:\n\n1. Take the number n as input\n2. Initialize the result as 1\n3. Iterate from 1 to n\n3.1. Multiply the result with the iteration number\n3.2. Increase the iteration number\n4. Exit the loop\n5. Output the result\n\nFor example, if the number is 5, the output will be 120 (1x2x3x4x5 = 120).",
