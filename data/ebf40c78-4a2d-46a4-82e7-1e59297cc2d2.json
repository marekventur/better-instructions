  "output": "Debit cards and credit cards differ in the way in which they are used and rewards offered. Debit cards are connected to a checking or savings account and allow users to spend the money they already have. Credit cards are issued by a bank and allow users to borrow money and pay it back over time. Debit cards generally have fewer fees, while credit cards typically provide rewards and other benefits.",
