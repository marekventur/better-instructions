  "output": "The best way to end a date with someone is on a positive note. Start by expressing gratitude for the other person's time and for the enjoyable experience you had together. You may also want to discuss aspects of the evening that felt meaningful to you. End by reaffirming your interest in seeing the other person again and offering a friendly hug, handshake, or kiss on the cheek. This sends a positive, respectful message that you are interested in getting to know the person better.",
