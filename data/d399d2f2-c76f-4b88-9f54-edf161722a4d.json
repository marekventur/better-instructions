  "output": "Artificial intelligence can be used in GPS navigation to help improve the accuracy and efficiency of route planning, by using algorithms to analyze previous trips and predict traffic flows and the optimal route. AI can also allow the system to learn and adjust to changes in map data, such as construction or one-way streets, in order to provide the most reliable directions.",
