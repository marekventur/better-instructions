  "output": "Universal basic income (UBI) is a policy proposal that provides a regular, unconditional cash payment to all citizens. UBI has the potential to reduce poverty, improve public health and wellbeing, and create a more secure, prosperous, and equitable society. UBI can be funded through a variety of means such as a financial transaction tax, carbon tax, or other taxes. UBI can help to reduce poverty and inequalities, reduce working hours and improve job security, and help to fund core public services. UBI can also help to encourage entrepreneurship and creativity, spur innovation, reduce unemployment, and create more socially and economically inclusive societies.",
