  "input": "",
  "output": "The principle of parsimony, also known as Occam's Razor, is a principle used to evaluate scientific explanations. The principle states that the explanation that requires the fewest number of assumptions is the most likely to be correct. This principle is used to make a judgement between two or more competing theories or explanations. By making the fewest assumptions, scientists can make the most accurate predictions and arrive at conclusions most closely aligned with the reality of the system they are studying.",
