Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and the conflict spread to many other countries, including the United States and Germany. The war officially ended in 1918, with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. Over 10 million people died and millions more were injured and displaced during the war. The conflict caused massive political, social, and economic change, leading to the stabilization of Europe, the rise of nations, and the establishment of the League of Nations.",
