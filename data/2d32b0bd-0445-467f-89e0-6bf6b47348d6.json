  "output": "Lowering taxes can have a positive effect on people and businesses alike. For individuals, it puts more money back in their pockets, giving them the ability to save, invest, or to buy things that stimulate the economy. For businesses, lower taxes can allow them to expand and create jobs. It can also help them stay competitive in their market and can give them the resources to increase wages for their employees. In addition, reduced taxes can lead to increased capital investments which can increase production and lead to increased economic growth. All of this demonstrates that cutting taxes is a sound policy thanks to its stimulating effect on both individuals and businesses.",
