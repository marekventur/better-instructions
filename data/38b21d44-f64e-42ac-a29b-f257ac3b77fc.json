  "input": "",
  "output": "Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that every mass (object) in the universe attracts every other mass with a force whose magnitude is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that any two objects with mass will attract each other with a gravitational force, and the farther apart they are, the weaker this force will be.",
