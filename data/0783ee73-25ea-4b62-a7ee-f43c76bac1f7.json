  "instruction": "Describe two strategies for dealing with keyword spam.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to deal with keyword spam is to implement an automated algorithm that identifies and filters out spammy keywords. This algorithm should use a range of criteria such as keyword density, language use or frequency of words associated with spam. Additionally, manual intervention to filter out spammy keywords can help to supplement the automated algorithm. Another strategy to deal with keyword spam is to use a keyword blacklist. This will prevent the keywords from appearing on the website in the first place. The blacklist should be updated regularly to keep up with new spammy keywords.",
