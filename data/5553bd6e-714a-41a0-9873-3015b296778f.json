  "output": "Trees do the planet so much good,\nThey freshen the air like they should \nFrom the leaves of a tree we take shade \nAnd without them, the world would be frayed\n\nThe branches are swaying with the breeze \nProviding shelter and giving a peace \nWithout tree these lands would be bare\nSo let's do our part and take care",
