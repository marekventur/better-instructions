  "output": "There are several steps businesses can take to improve cybersecurity. Implementing a strong password policy and regular authentication procedures is important to ensure privacy, as well as the use of two-factor authentication, data encryption and virtual private networks (VPNs). Businesses should also keep their systems and software updated, institute policies that limit user access on a need-to-know basis and use a presence detection system to monitor user activity. Additionally, they should regularly backup their data and deploy rigorous penetration testing, vulnerability scanning and malware prevention measures.",
