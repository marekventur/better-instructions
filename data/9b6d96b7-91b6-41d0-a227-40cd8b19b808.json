  "output": "Blockchain technology will revolutionize the banking industry by providing a secure and efficient way to transfer funds without the need of a centralized institution or intermediary. This means that banks will no longer need to rely on third-party intermediaries to process transactions, resulting in cost savings and increased efficiency. Additionally, since the transactions are stored on a secure distributed ledger, the data is protected from malicious actors, hackers, and interference from governments, greatly enhancing security.",
