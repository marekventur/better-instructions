  "output": "In basketball, shooting involves proper form, focus, and follow-through. Proper form involves having the ball slightly above the forehead and your feet aligned underneath the basket. Once you have the form down, focus on the hoop and imagine the ball going through it. Finally, add a bit of force by extending your arms and wrists and follow through with your wrists.",
