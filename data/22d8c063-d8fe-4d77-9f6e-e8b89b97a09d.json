  "input": "The night is dark and dreary,\nthere's no one around to hear me. \nI sit here and wallow in sorrow,\nas I watch the clouds grow weary.\n\nThe trees dance to my sadness,\nas clouds drift and appear grim.\nWrapped in a blanket of sadness\nI dont break as life grows dim.\n\nNo matter how far I travel,\nI cannot seem to escape my grief. \nMy tears join the lake's,\nas I try to find some relief.",
  "output": "The night is dark and dreary,\nThe stars they seem so unprepared \nTo bear witness to this tragic scene,\nAs I wallow in my despair.\n\nThe trees they dance sadly around me,\nThe clouds they drift and close in.\nWrapped in a blanket of sorrow,\nI do not surrender, nor do I win.\n\nNo matter how far I go,\nMy heavy heart follows me still. \nBut I must not give up yet,\nFor some hope, I will search until.\n\nThough the future appears unknown,\nAnd my luck seems far from free,\nI will try and find snippets of happiness,\nIn moments the world and I see.",
