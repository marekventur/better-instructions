  "instruction": "Explain why trade protectionism can hurt the economy of a country.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Trade protectionism is the practice of protecting domestic industries from foreign competition by imposing tariffs or other restrictions. This practice can be detrimental to the economy of the country that implements it because it raises the cost of imported goods, making them less affordable to consumers. This decreases demand for those goods, leading to fewer sales and less income for the domestic producers. Protectionism may also reduce the incentive for domestic companies to innovate or become more efficient, leading to inefficiency in the market. Finally, protectionism may also create economic tension between countries, leading to retaliatory tariffs that further restrict trade.",
