  "input": "",
  "output": "Relational databases are structured and organized around tables, which contain data that are connected and referenced between several different tables. They are highly organized, thus making them easier to maintain and query and more scalable than non-relational databases. Non-relational databases, on the other hand, do not use tables and are instead more loosely structured and more flexible. They are also typically easier to scale as they do not rely on a rigid structure. Non-relational databases are also better suited for large data sets and data that changes frequently as they are more dynamic.",
