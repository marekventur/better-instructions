  "output": "Molly and her grandmother were taking a walk in the park on a sunny day. As they walked and talked, Molly marvelled at the bright green grass and the sound of birds singing in the background. She had been to this park many times before, but it always felt special when she was with her grandmother. \n\nThe two eventually stopped at a nearby bench and sat down. Molly's grandmother began to tell her stories about her childhood, of all the adventures she used to have in the park, and the wonderful memories she had made. As Molly listened, a feeling of love and nostalgia filled her heart. \n\nBefore long, it was time to head home. As they walked, Molly's grandmother placed a hand on her shoulder and said, \u201cThey don\u2019t make memories like these anymore.\u201d",
