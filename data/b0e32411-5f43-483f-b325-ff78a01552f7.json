  "input": "",
  "output": "Free will and determinism are two contrasting conceptions of human behavior. Free will suggests that humans have the capacity to make choices and take actions of their own volition, while determinism suggests that human behavior is determined by external factors beyond individual control. Both theories have some plausible arguments and evidence, however, determinism implies that human behavior is predetermined and that free choice does not exist, while free will implies that individuals have the capacity to make choices and consciously affect their own paths in life.",
