  "output": "A GPT model is a type of language model that uses inputted data to create output based on statistical probability of words and phrases within a set of data. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that is able to analyze data in sets or sequences. A GPT model uses its probabilistic understanding of language to generate new text from a combination of new input and previously seen text, while RNNs use a series of contextual elements to extract relevant features from a given data set. GPT models are used for tasks such as natural language processing, text completion, and machine translation, while RNNs are used for tasks such as speech recognition and natural language understanding.",
