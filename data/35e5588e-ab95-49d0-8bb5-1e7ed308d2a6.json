  "input": "",
  "output": "A black hole is an incredibly dense region of space, created when a star collapses in upon itself due to its own gravity. Because the star is so dense, nothing can escape it, not even light, which is why it creates a \"black hole\" in space. The gravity within a black hole is so strong, anything near it, including stars, planets and even entire galaxies, are pulled in and eventually consumed.",
