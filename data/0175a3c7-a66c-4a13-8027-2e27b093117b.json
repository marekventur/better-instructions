It can contain biotic (living) components such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, as well as abiotic (nonliving) components such as water, atmosphere, and soil. A biome is a large group of ecosystems that share the same climate and have similar types of plants and animals. An example of a biome is a tropical rainforest, which contains several unique ecosystems within it.",
