  "output": "The life cycle of a product consists of five stages: introduction, growth, maturity, decline, and discontinuation. During the introduction stage, the product is launched on the market and the company works to make the customer aware of its existence. During the growth stage, the company has to make sure its product succeeds in the market with customer acceptance and increased sales. The maturity stage is when the product has become accepted and firmly established in the market. The decline stage is a period of decreasing sales as the product begins to get replaced by newer and better alternatives. The final stage is discontinuation, when the product is removed from the market entirely.",
