  "input": "",
  "output": "When a word ends in -y and the letter before the -y is a consonant, the -y should be changed to -i and -es should be added to form the plural. For example, the plural of family is families. However, if the letter before the -y is a vowel, there are usually no changes made to the spelling. For example, the plural of boys is boys.",
