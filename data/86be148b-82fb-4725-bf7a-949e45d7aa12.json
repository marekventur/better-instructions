  "instruction": "What is the difference between cellular respiration and fermentation?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Cellular respiration and fermentation are both processes that release energy from the breakdown of molecules such as glucose. Cellular respiration is an aerobic process involving the use of oxygen, whereas fermentation is an anaerobic process (in the absence of oxygen). Cellular respiration produces more energy than fermentation, but fermentation does not require oxygen, making it useful in certain conditions.",
