The walls should be painted a light, sunny yellow and decorated with pictures, posters and art work. The bed should be cozy and comfortable, with soft bedding and lots of pillows. The furniture should include a desk and chair for studying, a toy chest and shelves to store items, and a comfy armchair for reading. A set of lamps of various sizes, shapes and colors should also be included to provide warm lighting in the room.
