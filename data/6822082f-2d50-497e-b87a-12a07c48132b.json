  "input": "",
  "output": "One option for celebrating a ten-year wedding anniversary is to recreate your wedding day. Book the same venue you had your first wedding, arrive in the same car and at the same time, and dress up in the same attire. Reinvite all of your old guests and organize a few similar photos. Alternatively, take a trip together in celebration of the special occasion! Plan a destination that is special to your relationship and book a romantic getaway to make new memories. Go on a boat ride, view beautiful sights, and take long walks under the stars. If trips are not possible, organize a special dinner with close friends and family to share the joy of your union and reminisce about your wedding day.",
