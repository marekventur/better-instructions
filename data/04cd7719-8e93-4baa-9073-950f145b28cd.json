  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a group of animals who lived in an old farm. They were a diverse group of chickens, pigs, cows, and goats who were content just to live their simple lives and enjoy their idyllic surroundings. \n\nThen one day, their home was threatened when the farmer who owned the farm passed away and the farm was going to be sold to a property developer who wanted to build a new mall. \n\nUnwilling to give up their home, the animals banded together to save their beloved farm. The chickens used their superior flying skills to scout ahead and plotted out the best escape routes. The pigs used their strength to carry the weaker animals to safety. The cows churned up the ground, while the goats used their horns to shatter rocks and obstacles blocking their path. \n\nAnd before long, the animals had managed to evade the property developers and save their home. Now, they can continue living in peace, happy in the knowledge that their home is safe for now.",
