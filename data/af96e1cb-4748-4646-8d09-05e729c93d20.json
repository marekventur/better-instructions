  "output": "One example of a way in which renewable energy can be used is solar energy. Solar energy is renewable, abundant, and clean energy that is created when sunlight is converted into electrical energy through photovoltaic panels. Solar panels can be installed on rooftops or in open areas to capture and convert the sun's energy. This energy can then be used to power homes, businesses, and even entire cities.",
