  "output": "Once upon a time, there was an old man who lived alone in a small, forgotten village deep in the heart of the forest. Although he had few possessions, he was content with his simple life. One day, he was walking through the forest when he heard the distant sound of a meandering river. He instinctively followed its winding path, cautiously straying away from its bank. Unexpectedly, he stumbled upon a mysterious cave hidden behind a thick patch of foliage. The entrance glowed in an eerie light and as his curiosity got the better of him, he stepped inside. An unexplainable feeling of dread and terror seeped through him as he slowly made his way further into the depths of the cave.",
