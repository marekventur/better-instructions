  "output": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to develop diagnostic and treatment solutions in healthcare. One example of the deployment of AI is in the automated analysis of X-ray and CT scans. With these technologies, AI systems are capable of recognizing and analyzing features of images, which can then be used to make a reliable diagnosis. AI is also being used to develop personalized treatments, based on the analysis of detailed patient data, as well as modeling of disease progression.",
