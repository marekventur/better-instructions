  "input": "Global warming",
  "output": "Global warming could be likened to an enormous fire, blazing through the night sky. The flames seem to grow higher every day as more and more fuel is thrown onto the blaze. The fuel comes in many shapes and forms: carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, methane from livestock, industrial pollutant gases and much more. Meanwhile, winds of change are blowing in the other direction, trying to smother the fire and cool the planet. It's a crossfire between human activity and climate restoring efforts, with the planet's future in the balance.",
