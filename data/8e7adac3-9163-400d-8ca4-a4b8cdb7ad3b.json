  "output": "4.5.  The Godfather does an excellent job at capturing the atmosphere and culture of 1950s America, as well as the inner workings of the Corleone family, and offers many accurate factual details about the Mafia in the period. Although there are certain elements of the story that are historically inaccurate, overall, the movie does an excellent job of recreating the period and presenting an accurate representation of the American Mafia.",
