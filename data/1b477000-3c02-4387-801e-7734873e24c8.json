  "input": "",
  "output": "Setting realistic goals is an important part of planning for success. It helps people to stay motivated and focused on their tasks, and provides a way to measure progress and achievements along the way. Setting realistic goals also helps people stay organized and prioritize tasks so that they can make the best use of their time. By having a clear understanding of what is expected, people are more likely to stay on track and reach their goals. Finally, setting realistic goals can help people recognize when they need help and when to ask for it. This can help to prevent burnout or frustration when a task is proving more challenging than expected.",
