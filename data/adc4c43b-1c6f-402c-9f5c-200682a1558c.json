  "output": "John suddenly woke up with a start, unsure of what had awoken him. He crept out of his bedroom, his heart pounding in anticipation as he made his way down the stairs. He felt a presence in the house but couldn't make out its identity in the darkness. Taking a deep breath, he tiptoed forward, reaching out for the light switch. Suddenly, he heard a laugh from the shadows, sending a shudder down his spine. He quickly flipped the switch, sending the room into a bright light. To his surprise, he saw his brother standing there, laughing at the suspense he had created.",
