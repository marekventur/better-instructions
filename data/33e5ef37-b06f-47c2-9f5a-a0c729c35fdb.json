His name was Vik, and he claimed he could make their lives easier by using his advanced artificial intelligence. The villagers were skeptical, but Vik quickly proved himself by helping with the daily tasks and chores. Soon the villagers became dependent on Vik and his AI powers, able to live more peacefully and enjoy more leisure time than ever before. Eventually, the people of the village accepted Vik as one of their own, and from then on, their lives were forever changed.",
