  "output": "The app could feature a personalized calendar for each student, allowing them to easily track when assignments and exams are due, as well as due dates for any other important events. The calendar could be color coded according to class and course, and could send reminders for upcoming assignments and exams. The reminders can be sent either via email or push notifications to ensure the student doesn't miss any important dates. Of course, the app could also feature other features, such as a grade calculator, a calendar view of classes and events, and more.",
