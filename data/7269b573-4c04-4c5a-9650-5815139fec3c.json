  "input": "",
  "output": "A tree is a type of data structure that can be used to store and organize data in a hierarchical fashion. Trees consist of nodes, which contain the data, and branches, which connect the nodes. The root node of the tree is the starting point, and each node can have any number of children. Trees also have two types of traversal: depth-first and breadth-first. A tree is often used to represent hierarchies, such as the directory structure of a computer file system.",
