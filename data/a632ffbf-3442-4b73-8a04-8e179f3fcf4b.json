  "input": "",
  "output": "Algorithms are important for problem solving because they provide a structure for solving problems. By defining the Solution space, an algorithm can lead to better solutions and reduce the chances of making mistakes. Algorithms are also used in many fields, from engineering to economics, to analytics. They provide a basis for automating large, complex tasks, making them invaluable for efficient problem solving.",
