  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is that an ANN is a basic feed-forward neural network with a set of input and output layers, while a CNN is a type of neural network that is typically used for image- or video-based applications. Counvolutional Neural Networks use convolutional layers to extract features from data, allowing for more efficient and effective feature extraction and image recognition.",
