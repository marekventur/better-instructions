  "input": "",
  "output": "The major differences between the Rich and the Poor often come down to resources. The Rich have access to better education and healthcare, as well as financial freedom and opportunities to invest that the Poor do not. The Rich enjoy greater rights and legal protections, as well as access to technology and the ability to connect with powerful people and networks. The Poor often suffer from limited access to basic needs such as food, shelter and clean water, as well as lack of access to proper education and healthcare. Additionally, the Poor are more likely to face discrimination and a lack of economic opportunities.",
