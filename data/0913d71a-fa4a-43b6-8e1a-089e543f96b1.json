  "output": "Empty silence fills my days \nGrief is a heavy weight\nMemories linger like a fog\nPain resounds in every note\n\nI want to run away far \nTo escape all that I know \nBut the pain follows me still\nTaking my joy wherever I go\n\nThe sorrow creeps over me \nLike the rising of the tide\nIt consumes my everything \nLeaves a void I can't hide\n\nSometimes life takes what we have\nBut all I'm left with is me\nMy pain too hard to measure \nAnd all I can do is grieve",
