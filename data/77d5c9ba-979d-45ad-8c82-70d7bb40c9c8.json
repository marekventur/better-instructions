  "output": "One common issue in my community is the lack of access to fresh produce. Many local grocery stores are too expensive and are not conveniently located. To help address this issue, I would like to see a local farmer\u2019s market set up in the community, where local farmers can sell their produce at a more reasonable price. This would make fresh fruit and vegetables more accessible and affordable to those in the community.",
