  "input": "",
  "output": "The effects of AI on the job market have been far-reaching. AI is capable of performing many tasks that used to be performed by humans, thus leading to job losses for many people. However, AI has also opened up new job opportunities in many fields, such as data analysis, machine learning, and AI development. Additionally, AI has the potential to improve certain job functions and the overall efficiency of workers. The job market will continue to change as AI becomes increasingly advanced, but it will also open up new opportunities for current and future generations.",
