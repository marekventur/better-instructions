  "output": "The World Trade Organization (WTO) was created out of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994. The Uruguay Round began in 1986 and was aimed at liberalizing global trade through multilateral agreements and regulations. This was done by reducing tariffs, removing barriers and other government interventions, increasing intellectual property rights, and opening agriculture and services markets to international investment and competition. After 8 years of negotiations, 123 nations signed the Uruguay Round agreements in Marrakech, Morocco in April 1994. The WTO was then founded at the same location the following month, providing a forum for the newly-created agreements to be implemented and modified. The WTO agreements sought to increase trade and economic growth, reduce poverty, and provide fair and equitable access to global markets for all types of goods and services.",
