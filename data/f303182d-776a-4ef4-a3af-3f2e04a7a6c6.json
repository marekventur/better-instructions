  "output": "Making peanut butter typically involves a few simple steps. The first step is to roast the peanuts. Peanuts are then passed through a grinder or mill, which grinds the peanuts into a paste. Sweeteners, like sugar and/or honey, may then be added to the peanut paste in order to give the peanut butter more flavor. Finally, the peanut butter is then transferred to containers and cooled. The result is often a smooth, spreadable consistency. Depending on the recipe, other flavors and ingredients can be added as well, such as chocolate, almonds, coconut, or salt.",
