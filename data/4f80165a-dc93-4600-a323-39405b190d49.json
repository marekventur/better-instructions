  "output": "Technology has had a major impact on the way people communicate with each other. It has allowed for the development of faster, more reliable ways of communicating, such as email, instant messaging, and video conferencing. These technologies have broken the barriers of distance and time and have made connecting with someone thousands of miles away just as easy as connecting with someone down the street. Additionally, they have enabled people to exchange larger amounts of information at a much faster rate, making communication more effective and efficient.",
