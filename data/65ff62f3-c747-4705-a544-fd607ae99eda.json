  "input": "",
  "output": "The commercialization of sports has had a negative impact on the overall experience for fans. It has created an environment of inflated prices where tickets and merchandise are often unaffordable for the average person. The focus on profits has caused sports to become more of an entertainment business than a game, making the fan experience overly commercialized and less focused on the sport itself. Additionally, commercialization has caused an increase in corruption and unethical behavior within the sports world, as the competition is more focused on increasing profits rather than playing fair.",
