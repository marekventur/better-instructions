  "output": "Jupiter's atmosphere is divided into five layers, with temperatures descending from an average of about 250 degrees Celsius at the top of the troposphere, to below -150 degrees Celsius at about 50 km deep. From about 50 km down to the surface, temperatures drop rapidly to around -80 degrees Celsius. Above the troposphere is an inversion layer that is at a surprisingly high temperature of around -30 degrees Celsius. The stratosphere is much colder, with temperatures dropping to around -150 degrees Celsius at 200 km. Above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, which acts as a buffer between the stratosphere and the thermosphere and extends out to around 500 km where temperatures can reach around 1,000 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the thermosphere is the outermost zone of the atmosphere and is composed of layers of ionized particles that can reach temperatures well above 1,000 degrees Celsius.\n//EOM//",
