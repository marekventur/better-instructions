  "output": "One great way to use up leftover vegetables is to make a stir fry. Start by heating some oil in a large skillet or wok. Add the vegetables and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened and beginning to brown. Then, add some soy sauce, garlic, and ginger for flavor and mix everything together. Serve the stir fry over some rice and enjoy!",
