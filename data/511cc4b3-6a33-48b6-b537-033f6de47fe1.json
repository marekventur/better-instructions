The dragon was said to have incredible mystical powers, and it granted a single wish to whoever ventured deep enough into its forest to find it. One day a brave knight set out to find the dragon, hoping to make his dream come true. He searched the forest for days until he stumbled upon a clearing with a strange stone in the middle. As he came closer, he realized it was the dragon he had been searching for. The brave knight made his wish, and the dragon granted it. Thus, the knight fulfilled his quest, and the ancient forest remains a place of magical mystery to this day.",
