Allow it to thaw slowly in the fridge for at least 24 hours.\n3. Once the chicken has thawed, use it immediately or store it in the fridge for up to 2 days.\n4. If necessary, you can also place the chicken in a sealed, water-tight bag and submerge it in cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes to keep it chilled.\n5. You can also defrost frozen chicken in the microwave on the defrost setting. Make sure to monitor the cooking time so that the chicken does not start to cook.",
