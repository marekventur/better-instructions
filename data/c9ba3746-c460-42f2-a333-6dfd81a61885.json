  "input": "",
  "output": "Global warming is causing sea levels to rise at an accelerated rate. This is because as the Earth\u2019s surface temperature rises, more water is evaporated from the oceans, which in turn increases the amount of water in the atmosphere and leads to more precipitation. This extra volume of water results in an increase in sea levels due to melting ice caps, glaciers and polar ice sheets. Furthermore, the warming of the oceans causes the water to expand, resulting in a further rise in sea levels.",
