  "output": "Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity, first proposed in 1905, is widely considered to be one of the most influential scientific theories of all time. It states that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion, and as a result, time and space are intertwined. This means that an object's speed, its position in space, and even its mass can affect the passage of time. Einstein also proposed that gravity is the result of the curvature of spacetime, which means that gravity can be thought of as a bend in the fabric of the universe. Ultimately, the Theory of Relativity explains the behavior of the universe on a large scale and has been used to confirm numerous modern scientific discoveries.",
