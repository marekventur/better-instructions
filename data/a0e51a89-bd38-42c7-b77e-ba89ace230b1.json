  "output": "I have created a silly animal called the Goofin. It has an orange body, a pink beak, two shimmering purple wings, and a long tail with stripes of blue and yellow. The Goofin loves to eat jellybeans and has big eyes that change color when it gets upset. It can also dance and has been seen doing the \u2018Electric Slide\u2019. When it comes to sleeping, the Goofin would rather sleep standing up than lying down. It\u2019s a silly and fun animal to have around the house!",
