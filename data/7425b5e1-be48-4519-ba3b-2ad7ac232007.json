  "input": "",
  "output": "Supply and demand is an economic model that describes the interaction between the sellers of a product (suppliers) and the buyers of a product (demanders). The price of the product is determined by the amount of supply (how much of the product is available) and the amount of demand (how many people are wanting to buy the product). If supply is high and demand is low, the price of the product will go down; and if supply is low and demand is high, the price of the product will go up.",
