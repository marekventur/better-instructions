  "input": "",
  "output": "Techniques for preventing overfitting in machine learning include regularization, data augmentation, early stopping, ensembling, and testing various hyperparameters. Regularization is a technique used to reduce the complexity of the model, while data augmentation involves generating new data by perturbing existing data to reduce overfitting. Early stopping and ensembling involve selecting the best model based on certain criteria or combining different models, respectively. Finally, testing various hyperparameters is a process of selecting the ideal hyperparameters for a model to ensure the best results.",
