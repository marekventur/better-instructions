  "input": "",
  "output": "Though hurricanes and tornadoes are both powerful wind storms, they actually have very different structures and effects. Hurricanes are much larger in size and scale than tornadoes, develop over a larger area, and can last for several days or even weeks. They are also much more destructive, with their strong winds and heavy rains capable of causing widespread flooding and damage. Tornadoes, on the other hand, are much smaller and more contained with their funnel shaped path and often only last a few minutes. However, they can also have devastating effects, as their very strong winds are capable of causing significant destruction.",
