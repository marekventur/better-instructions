  "input": "",
  "output": "International businesses operate across multiple countries, while local businesses operate within a single country or region. International businesses often have more complex operations, involving labour laws, tax regulations, trade laws, cultural differences, and language barriers. Local businesses, on the other hand, often focus on a smaller geographic area, and may have more straightforward operations. Both can benefit from utilizing international services, such as international shipping, foreign exchange services, and local business services to help them operate successfully.",
