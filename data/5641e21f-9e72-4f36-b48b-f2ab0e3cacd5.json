  "input": "",
  "output": "The producer-consumer problem is a classic part of computer science and refers to a scenario in which multiple processes share a common communication space such as a buffer. In this scenario, a producer process produces data elements which are input to the buffer and a consumer process reads the data from the same buffer and processes it. The producer-consumer problem typically occurs when the producer process produces data faster than the consumer can process it, and there is the potential for either or both processes to be delayed depending on their speed and efficiencies.",
