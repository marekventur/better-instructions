  "input": "",
  "output": "The Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on the environment. It led to a significant increase in the use of natural resources, resulting in deforestation, air and water pollution, and other environmental problems. The increase in energy consumption due to the use of coal and other fossil fuels also led to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and global warming. Additionally, the advance of industrialization decreased the natural habitats of many species, leading to a decrease in biodiversity.",
