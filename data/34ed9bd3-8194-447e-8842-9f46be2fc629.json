  "instruction": "Name one thing that you could do to reduce your environmental footprint.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One simple way to reduce your environmental footprint is to switch to energy-efficient solutions every time you buy or replace electronics and appliances. Energy-efficient solutions consume less energy, require less electricity to use, and usually offer a long-term saving in electricity bills. Additionally, you can reduce your consumption of single-use plastics such as plastic water bottles, straws and grocery bags. Instead, opt to use reusable or recyclable items when possible. Finally, you can limit your driving and use public transit, carpooling, or biking to get around.",
