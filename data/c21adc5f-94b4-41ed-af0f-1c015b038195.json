  "input": "",
  "output": "The bias-variance trade-off is an important concept in machine learning which states that a model\u2019s accuracy is determined by both the bias and the variance of the model. A model with high bias, or underfitting, will have low accuracy, while a model with high variance, or overfitting, will also have low accuracy. The ideal model is the one which has low bias and low variance, but this is a difficult balance to achieve. This is essentially a trade-off between two conflicting goals, where reducing the bias can cause an increase in the variance, and vice versa. In order to achieve the best model, it is important to strike the right balance between bias and variance.",
