  "input": "",
  "output": "A sustainability paradox is a situation where an action that is intended to promote sustainability actually works against it. For example, when people are encouraged to buy a more fuel-efficient vehicle to reduce emissions, they may be more likely to drive more due to the reduced cost of transportation. As a result, the net environmental impact can be worse than it was originally.",
