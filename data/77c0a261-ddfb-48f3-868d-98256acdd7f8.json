  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of a technology-driven tool used to aid people with disabilities is a smart wheelchair. Smart wheelchairs are powered wheelchairs that are integrated with sensors and computer processors. They can be programmed with voice recognition and motion sensors, so they can recognize verbal commands and use motion tracking to move the wheelchair in the desired direction. Smart wheelchairs also come with navigation and environmental control functions, which can help people with physical disabilities move around and interact with their environment more easily. Smart wheelchairs provide autonomy and an improved quality of life to those with physical impairments.",
