  "output": "John and Mary have been together for a year now. Everything is perfect. But when John goes to pick Mary up in the evening, he notices that she is not her usual self. He questions her and discovers that she has been feeling isolated and apprehensive. John reassures her and helps her open up about all the worries that she has been feeling, helping her see that all her worries can be tackled together. He then takes her to a special spot that he had been planning all along, and they spend the rest of the evening watching the stars, looking into each other\u2019s eyes, and talking about all their hopes and dreams for the future.",
