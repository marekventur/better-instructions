  "input": "",
  "output": "Once there was a frog and a fly who both got stuck in a maze. The frog leapt from lilypad to lilypad, while the fly constantly buzzed around in circles, never managing to go anywhere. Eventually, the frog found its way out, while the fly eventually gave up in exhaustion. From then on, the frog and fly had a special bond, and whenever they got into a tricky situation, the frog said to the fly, \"Don't worry, I'll fly you out of this one!\"",
