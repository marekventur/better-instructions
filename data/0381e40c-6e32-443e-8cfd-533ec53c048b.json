  "input": "",
  "output": "Canadian independence was achieved over a series of constitutional reforms, culminating in the Constitution Act, 1982. Before then, the nation had been governed by laws and regulations made in Britain, which could be changed or repealed by British parliament and courts. Canada became an independent nation on July 1, 1982, when it gained full control over its own government, laws, and future. Canada, however, remains a member of the Commonwealth and is still a part of the British monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State. Thus, Canada retains close ties with the United Kingdom.",
