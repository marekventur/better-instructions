  "instruction": "Analyze the following family situation and provide recommendations for how each family member can deal with their issues.",
  "input": "John, who is a single dad, has two teenage daughters, Kim and Amy. Kim is 16, rebellious, and struggles with her grades in school. Amy is 14, and she's very timid and gets bullied at school.",
  "output": "John should focus on developing a trusting relationship with Kim based on respect, rather than discipline. Helping Kim discover her hobbies, explore her independence and make her own choices can be challenging but rewarding. Open communication between all of them is important, such as where Kim is going and when she will be back. With Amy, John should be sure to provide a safe space for her and increase her overall sense of security. He should also encourage her to confide in him more and provide her with the affirmation she needs. Additionally, John should recognize both Kim\u2019s efforts when it comes to her school work and Amy\u2019s need for more attention. Ultimately, the goal is for each family member to have their needs met in a balanced way.",
