  "output": "Verse 1\n\nThe city skyline stands so strong\nThrough the night its sky is long\nThe stars light up its ivory walls\nAnd fill the darkness with surreal calls\nThe lights below the sky unfold\nBridges to cities, stories untold\nVeils of clouds above them floating\nGlistens like a shimmering coating\n\nVerse 2\n\nA backdrop of amaranthine hues\nClimbing skyward, no one refuses\nThe sky above holds so much awe\nA cool gentle breeze, nature's claw\nTwinkling stars, the night aglow\nHung amidst the ebon sky's flow\nAn array of street lamps, glimmer dim\nDecorate the city's nightly trim\n\nVerse 3\n\nAn abbey stands atop a nearby hill\nThe night sky is so still\nMoonlight glistening off its steeple\nThe night air a refreshing tussle\nA formation of birds soaring free\nShadows of freedom, peacefully\nSpinning and twisting with grace\nThe night moves on at its pace\n\nVerse 4\n\nThe skyline sparkles a midnight blue\nThe dreamscape a dreamer's view\nSkyscrapers of the night so grand\nFrom far below, we see them stand\nThe stars and lights so bright above\nA hypnotizing sight, a sign of love\nBeacons of glory, up into the sky\nA beautiful sight for passersby\n\nVerse 5\n\nAt the break of morning we can see\nThe silhouettes of towers piercing free\nThe skyline changed, yet still the same\nThe city wakes, but only a few remain\nThe night is gone, but never ends\nDarkness fades and new beginnings lend\nMarveling at its beauty and its grace\nThe city skyline stands in its place.",
