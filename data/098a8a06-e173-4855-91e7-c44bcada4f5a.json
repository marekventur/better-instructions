  "output": "The best way to prevent the spread of a cold is to practice good hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and warm water, or use hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick and try to stay away from crowds. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched. Get the recommended amount of sleep, exercise, and eat a healthy diet. Consider getting a flu shot to help protect against the flu.",
