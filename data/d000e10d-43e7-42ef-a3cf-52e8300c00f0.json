  "input": "",
  "output": "A RESTful API is an architectural style used to create web services that make use of the HTTP protocol. It stands for Representational State Transfer, and is essentially a way of using the same techniques of web development to create a robust, efficient, and scalable system for providing web services. An example of a RESTful API is the Twitter API, which enables developers to access user data from the platform, as well as post tweets or access messages from other users.",
