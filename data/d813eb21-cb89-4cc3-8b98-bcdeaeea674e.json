  "output": "It was the middle of the night, and the moon was unusually bright. Michael had been lying awake, unable to sleep, and the night's stillness had drawn him out of his bedroom and into the forest. The air was crisp, but he felt strangely alive. He walked slowly, revelling in the peace of the dark woods.\n\nSuddenly, he heard the sound of a twig snapping. He stopped and held his breath, straining his ears for something else, and he heard it again. It was almost like a whisper, low and rough. He quickly scanned his surroundings, his heart pounding, but it was dead silent.\n\nDetermined to find out what was going on, Michael crept towards the source of the sound. There was something -- or someone -- in the clearing ahead. As he got closer, he could make out a figure, looming in the shadows. He inched closer, tiptoeing nearer to the great silhouette but as soon as he was close enough to discern any details, the figure faded away. He could feel a chill swirling around him, and he shivered.\n\nWhat had been lurking in the shadows?",
