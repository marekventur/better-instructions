  "output": "The Maasai people are a semi-nomadic people of East Africa known for their distinct dress and portable dwellings. Maasai culture is based on a pastoralist lifestyle, with cows being central to their economy. Other aspects of their culture include intricate rituals and ceremonies, highly developed music and art, and a strong sense of community. The Maasai are known for their traditional resistance against colonization, which has resulted in their territory remaining un-developed and untamed to this day.",
