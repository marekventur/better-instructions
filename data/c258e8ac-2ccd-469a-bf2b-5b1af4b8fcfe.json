  "input": "",
  "output": "Hyperparameter optimization is the process of automatically finding the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model. Popular techniques for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves manually defining a set of hyperparameters and evaluating them. Random search involves evaluating randomly selected hyperparameters. Bayesian optimization uses probability distributions and Bayesian inference to search for the optimal hyperparameters.",
