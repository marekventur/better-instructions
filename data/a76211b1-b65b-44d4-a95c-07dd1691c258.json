  "input": "",
  "output": "Five common forms of bias found in predictive modeling include:\n\n1. Sampling bias: Occurs when the data used to generate a predictive model is not representative of the population of interest.\n\n2. Selection bias: Occurs when the data is not sampled correctly, leading the model to over- or under-represent certain groups or features.\n\n3. Confounding bias: Occurs when a predictive model only considers one feature of a situation, and not the overall context.\n\n4. Survivorship bias: Occurs when a predictive model includes only those that have already succeeded, instead of also including those that have failed or are likely to fail.\n\n5. Data leakage bias: Occurs when a predictive model is built using data from the future, instead of only data from the past. This type of bias can lead the model performance to be overstated.",
