  "input": "",
  "output": "Big-O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the complexity of algorithms and to measure the speed and memory of different algorithms. It describes the time and space taken by a program to complete its task asymptotically and is expressed as a function of the size of the input. The Big-O notation simplifies the complexity of a given algorithm by providing an upper bound on the running time complexity in terms of the size of the input. It is usually used to compare different algorithms and determine which one is optimal for a given task. The Big-O notation is an important tool for determining the best algorithm when optimizing the time taken to complete a task.",
