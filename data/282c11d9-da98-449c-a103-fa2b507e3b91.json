  "instruction": "For this given scenario, suggest three possible solutions.",
  "input": "A town is running out of water.",
  "output": "1. Implement conservation measures - such as limiting water usage, using water efficient appliances, and redirecting sewage back into the water cycle. \n\n2. Incorporate rainwater harvesting - using rainwater harvesting tanks to collect and store any rain that falls in the area can provide a sustainable source of water. \n\n3. Invest in suitable infrastructure -investing in water pipes that are able to connect nearby sources of water to the town could provide enough water to last them through the dry season.",
