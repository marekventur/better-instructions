  "input": "",
  "output": "In India, some of the primary environmental issues are air pollution, water pollution, illegal logging, declining forest cover, soil degradation, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, over-exploitation of natural resources, water scarcity, gas emissions from factories, and climate change.  Additionally, India suffers from solid waste management problems due to rapid urbanization, resulting in air and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity.  Finally, India has been facing a rapid decline in its biodiversity, with the loss of species, habitats, and natural resources.  India is also one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the effects of climate change, and is facing heat waves, floods, and droughts as a result.",
