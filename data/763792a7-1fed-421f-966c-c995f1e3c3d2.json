  "input": "\"The Tyger\" by William Blake",
  "output": "The Tyger by William Blake is a powerful poem full of symbolism. The poem's title symbolizes the narrator's appreciation of the mysteries of nature and his wonderment at the manifestation of God's creations. The imagery of the \"fearful symmetry\" uses the tiger's physical features - its bright eyes, fearful paws, and floating tail - to symbolize powerful forces in the universe. The smith is a symbol of God's creativity and the continuous cycle of creation and destruction. The blacksmith forging the tiger's muscles from fire symbolizes the fear and uncertainty of life. Finally, the burning question of the poem - What immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry - serves as a powerful symbol of the search for knowledge and understanding.",
