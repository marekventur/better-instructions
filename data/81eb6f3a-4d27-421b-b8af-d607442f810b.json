  "output": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number a^p - a is an integer multiple of p (a^p = a (mod p)). This theorem can be used in cryptography today to test whether a given number is prime or not. In order to use Fermat's Little Theorem, one must select a number a randomly and test whether a^(p-1) - 1 is divisible by p. If yes, then the given number is most likely prime.",
