  "output": "A real-world example of a machine learning-based project is Amazon's product recommendation engine. The engine uses machine learning algorithms to make product recommendations to customers based on the products they search for and view on the Amazon website. This type of project uses data such as customer purchase history, product ratings, and customer feedback to generate product recommendations tailored to the individual user. As a result, customers are more likely to find the product they are looking for and Amazon increases its sales.",
