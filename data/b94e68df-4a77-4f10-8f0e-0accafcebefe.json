  "output": "The expression \"to steal one's thunder\" is used figuratively to describe a situation in which one person uses or claims another person's ideas, achievements or successes as their own. It originates from the 1700s and describes a literal incident in which a company of traveling actors discovered a machine they could use to create a sound like thunder from the stage. When another company of actors used the machine without the credit or permission of the first company, it was said that they had \"stolen their thunder.\"",
