  "input": "unsorted_list = [2,1,4,3]\nunsorted_list.sort()",
  "output": "Sorting in Python works by rearranging the elements of a list according to a certain criteria. In the code snippet given, the list is sorted in ascending order. This is done by comparing each element in the list to its neighbor and when the order is incorrect, the elements are swapped. This process continues until all elements in the list are in the correct order, i.e. the list is sorted.",
