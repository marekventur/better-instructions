  "output": "The history of the internet began with the advent of the ARPANET project in the late 1960s, which connected computers over telephone lines. The World Wide Web was developed in 1991 and the browser revolutionized how people could access and share information. During the 1990s, the internet expanded rapidly, allowing people to communicate and exchange data over long distances. The early 2000s saw the rise of social media, with platforms like Facebook and Twitter allowing people to easily connect and share with one another. Today, the internet continues to be a powerful tool for connecting people around the world, allowing us to share knowledge, ideas, and experiences.",
