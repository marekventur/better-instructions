  "output": "Global warming is caused by the increase of certain gases in our atmosphere that trap heat. These gases are typically released as a result of human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This heat trapping leads to climate change and the resulting weather extremes, the risk of extreme storms, and rising sea levels. There are several solutions to global warming, such as emissions reduction and increased use of renewable energy sources, that can mitigate these consequences.",
