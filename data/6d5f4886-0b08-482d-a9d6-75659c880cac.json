  "output": "Three security measures that can help protect a company\u2019s online data include using secure passwords, using two-factor authentication, and implementing a cloud firewall. Secure passwords should be used to protect data from unauthorized access. It is also important to use two-factor authentication to verify user identity and limit access to confidential information.
