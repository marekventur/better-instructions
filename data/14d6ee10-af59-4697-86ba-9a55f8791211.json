By collecting and analyzing demographics data, companies can assess consumer preferences and make decisions on what products to produce and inform marketing campaigns to target the right consumer groups. Demographics data can also be used by government bodies to collect data on the population, including data on income, education, housing, and other socioeconomic indicators. This data is essential to policy-makers when it comes to making decisions concerning taxation, public services, and welfare programs.",
