  "output": "The protagonist of the 1930s heist movie is a cunning and experienced thief named James Cooper. He is a master planner, an expert hustler, and an all-around master of disguise. James is a smooth talker and a way with words, but he isn't afraid to get his hands dirty when necessary. He has a moral code and will only commit a crime if he gets something out of it. Above all, James is the kind of clever thief that plans five steps ahead of everyone else.",
