  "instruction": "Is it ethical to splice genes of animals?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "There is no clear consensus on the ethics of gene splicing. Some argue that animal suffering should be minimized and gene splicing can lead to species that have a better quality of life. Others contend that gene splicing interferes with the natural order and takes away essential freedoms from animals. Ultimately, whether it is ethical or not depends on the specific case, with considerations made for the welfare of the animals involved and for the potential consequences for the species.",
