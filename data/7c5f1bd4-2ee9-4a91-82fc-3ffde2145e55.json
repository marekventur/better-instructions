  "input": "",
  "output": "Meditation is the practice of intentionally focusing the mind on a particular subject, object, or activity in order to increase awareness and reduce stress. Mindfulness, on the other hand, is the practice of being present in the moment and paying attention to one's thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgement. In other words, mindfulness is cultivating an awareness of one's present experience and observing it with acceptance, whereas meditation is a set of techniques that focus on directing the attention to a specific object or practice.",
