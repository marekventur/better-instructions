  "input": "",
  "output": "Not recycling leads to increased pollution and a greater risk of global warming. It also leads to the depletion of natural resources, as materials need to be harvested to replace those that are not recycled. Furthermore, it has a negative impact on the economy, as the cost of materials needed to replace the un-recycled materials is unnecessarily high.",
