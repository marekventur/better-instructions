  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between private and public schools is the source of funding. Private schools are often funded through tuition fees and donations while public schools are funded by state and local governments. Another difference is in the type of education offered. Private schools generally offer more traditional curriculums with an emphasis on college prep while public schools are more likely to offer wider range of options including vocational and technical education.",
