  "input": "",
  "output": "The principle of cause and effect states that all events, actions, or behaviors have a cause and, in turn, will have an effect. It is the relationship in which one event or action directly causes another related event or action. For example, if a person is late for work, the consequence (i.e. effect) could be a warning or even a dismissal from their job. Therefore, the cause is being late for work.",
