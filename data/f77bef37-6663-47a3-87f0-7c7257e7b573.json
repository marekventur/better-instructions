  "instruction": "Research and identify if any artificial sweeteners are safe for consumption.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), some artificial sweeteners are considered safe for consumption. These include aspartame, acesulfame, saccharin, and sucralose. Aspartame has been shown to be safe for most individuals, however people with a rare genetic disorder called phenylketonuria should avoid consuming it. Acesulfame and saccharin, both known as sugar substitutes, have been found to be safe for consumption and may contain fewer calories than sugar. Sucralose is another sucrose-derived sweetener that is considered safe for consumption and is found in many products. However, more research is needed to determine the long-term safety of these artificial sweeteners.",
