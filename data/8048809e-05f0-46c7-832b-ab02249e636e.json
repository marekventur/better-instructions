  "input": "",
  "output": "The stock market is like a giant store. Companies who own things like factories, stores, and websites sell part of their things in this store to people who want to own a part of the company. If the company is successful and people like what the company does, then more people will want to buy these things from the store. This causes the price to go up and the owners of the company make money. But, if the company is not doing well, then fewer people will want to buy the things from the store, and the price will go down and the owners of the company will lose money.",
