  "instruction": "Describe the differences between DSLR, Point and Shoot and Smartphone Camera in terms of their features and specifications.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "DSLRs have larger sensors, a wide range of interchangeable lenses, and superior low light performance, giving them the highest image quality out of all the camera types. Point and shoot cameras typically have a small sensor, limited lens options, and are usually simpler to use than DSLRs. Smartphone cameras typically have a smaller sensor than point and shoot cameras and lack optical zoom, but they are convenient and contain many features like HDR, face recognition, and auto-stabilisation.",
