  "output": "Regular physical exercise has been proven to have positive effects on mental health. When we exercise, our body releases endorphins and other hormones that not only reduce stress, but can also improve our mental health. Exercise helps to reduce levels of anxiety and depression, as well as improve overall mood and increase happiness. Exercise can also help boost self-esteem, physical confidence, and feelings of accomplishment. Ultimately, physical exercise is an easy and practical way to take care of both our physical and mental health.",
