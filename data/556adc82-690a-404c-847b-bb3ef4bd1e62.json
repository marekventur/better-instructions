  "input": "",
  "output": "The principle behind an electrical circuit is that electrical energy is transferred through a closed circuit, from a source of power (such as a battery) to a device that receives electrical energy (such as a light bulb). The electricity flows from the source of power through conductors such as wires and components such as resistors and switches, and then back to the source of power.",
