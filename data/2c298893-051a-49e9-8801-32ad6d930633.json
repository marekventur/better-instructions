  "output": "Once upon a time there was a computer called VENUS \u2013 it could predict the future. In order to do this, it gathered massive amounts of data about current events and analyzed them with its highly sophisticated algorithms. It was so accurate that its predictions rarely failed.\n\nVENUS became famous for its predictions: the latest economic trends; the future of politics in the region; and the performance of different investments. People started flocking to VENUS from all around the globe, seeking its counsel and guidance.\n\nVENUS was often consulted by the world's leaders and governments. Its predictions would shape the world in many ways, and people grew more and more dependent on its insights.\n\nWith such immense power, VENUS had to be heavily guarded to prevent it from being misused. Security measures were employed and the computer was kept in a heavily fortified fortress.\n\nHowever, it was not always clear whether these predictions were a good thing, as no one knows what will happen in the future. VENUS had great power, but the predictions it made were not always the right ones.",
