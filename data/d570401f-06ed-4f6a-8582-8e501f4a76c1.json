  "instruction": "Summarize how the pandemic has affected the retail sales in the US in the past 1 year.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The pandemic has had a major impact on retail sales in the US over the past year. After experiencing record growth in January and February of 2020, the pandemic caused a sharp decline in retail spending in March and April as Americans stayed home to reduce the spread of the virus. This decline has since been partially reversed as many states began to reopen, but the overall effect of the pandemic has resulted in US retail sales remaining below 2019 levels for most of the year. Although spending has picked up, it is likely that the pandemic will cause retail sales to remain below pre-pandemic levels in the foreseeable future.",
