  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of the rule of law being broken in history is the Saturday Night Massacre. During the Watergate scandal of the 1970s, President Nixon ordered the firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox which violated the network of checks and balances established in the US Constitution. This act of defiance was widely criticized and sparked outrage across the country. It led to Nixon\u2019s resignation from office and was later seen as a major step towards the decline of corruption in the US government.",
