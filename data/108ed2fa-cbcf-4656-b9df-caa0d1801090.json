  "output": "Air pollution has major harmful effects on people's health, the environment, and the economy. Poor air quality has been linked to respiratory diseases, such as asthma, lung cancer, and stroke. Air pollution can also reduce crop yields, damage ecosystems, and degrade the quality of natural resources. Further, exposure to polluted air can cause financial losses by impairing the performance of outdoor workers and hindering economic productivity. Beyond the damaging effects to human health and the environment, air pollution also has massive economic costs, particularly in the automotive, energy, and aviation sectors.",
