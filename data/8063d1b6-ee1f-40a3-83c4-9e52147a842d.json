  "input": "Article:\n\nThe new Apple Watch Series 6 touts its ability to measure blood oxygen levels, as well as tracking activities and sleep. Even though its features seem impressive, the tech giant isn\u2019t the first to combine this technology into a smart watch. In fact, Fitbit released a watch with the same type of technology earlier in the year.",
  "output": "The new Apple Watch Series 6 is marketed as a revolutionary device thanks to its ability to measure blood oxygen levels and track activities and sleep. However, this is not the first time this type of technology has been combined with a smart watch, as Fitbit released a similar device earlier in the year. Apple is late to the game when it comes to this type of technology, and consumer choice may suffer if Apple continues to lag behind. Additionally, the cost of the new Apple Watch is relatively high compared to similar devices from other manufacturers. All in all, while the new features of the Apple Watch may seem enticing to users, it is worth considering other options available on the market.",
