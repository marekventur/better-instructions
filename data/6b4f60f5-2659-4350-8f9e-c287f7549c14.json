  "output": "This recipe for crunchy pancakes calls for 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 eggs, 1 cup of whole milk, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Start by mixing the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder and salt) together in a bowl. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl, then lightly whisk in the milk and oil. Finally, add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until no large lumps remain. Cook the pancakes in a greased skillet over medium-high heat, flipping once until golden brown.",
