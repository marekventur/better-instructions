  "input": "",
  "output": "A city with rapid population growth should consider investing in public transportation in order to alleviate traffic congestion. This could include buses, subway systems, light rail options, and even bike-sharing programs. These solutions are cost-effective and have the potential to reduce traffic and air pollution, as well as make it easier for people to get around. Additionally, in order to accommodate the increased demand for transportation, the city may also need to invest in infrastructure such as road expansion and parking lots.",
