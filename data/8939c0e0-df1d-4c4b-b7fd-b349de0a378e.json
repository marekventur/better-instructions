  "output": "Proof:\n\nLet a and b be two odd numbers. This means they can be expressed as 2n + 1, where n is an integer. \n\nIf a = 2n + 1 and b = 2m + 1, then the sum of a and b = (2n + 1) + (2m + 1) = 2(n+m) + 2 = 2(n+m+1). \n\nSince n+m+1 is an integer, the sum of two odd numbers must be even. \n\nQ.E.D.",
