  "output": "I would love to visit the Taj Mahal in India, the Eiffel Tower in France, and the Great Wall of China. The Taj Mahal is an icon of love and beauty and visiting it would allow me to explore India\u2019s culture and history. At the Eiffel Tower, I could get a stunning view of Paris and observe the hustle and bustle of the city. Finally, the Great Wall of China is one of the most incredible man-made structures and taking a walk along its path would be an unforgettable experience.",
