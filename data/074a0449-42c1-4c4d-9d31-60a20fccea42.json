  "output": "John was just a normal kid. He had a stuffed elephant from his grandmother and loved it like it was a member of the family. Every night, John would tuck the elephant in with him and talk about his day with it. \nOne day, John was surprised to discover that his elephant had gone out on an adventure of its own. As it turned out, some of the other stuffed animals in his room had banded together and gone off on an exploration of the town. They had been gone all day, gathering ice cream and stories, and John was delighted to hear all of the tales when they finally returned. From that day on, John was never quite the same. He seemed to believe that anything was possible and eagerly awaited the next adventure he and his elephant would go on.",
