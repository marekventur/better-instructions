  "input": "",
  "output": "Two possible strategies for managing customer complaints are:\n\n1. Create a formal customer complaint process for responding to customer complaints in an organized and efficient manner. This includes listening to customer feedback, documenting it, and tracking each customer complaint until it is resolved.\n\n2. Take a proactive approach by performing customer satisfaction surveys to anticipate customer complaints before they arise. This allows customer service representatives to identify and address issues before they become major issues that require expensive remediation.",
