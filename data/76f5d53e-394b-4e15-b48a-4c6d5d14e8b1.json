One day, the younger son saw a beggar on the side of the road, and he made fun of him and drove him away. The farmer saw this happen and scolded his son for his cruelty. That night, the old farmer dreamed of a wise man who told him that his son had just experienced a taste of karma. From then on, the younger son always remembered his father's lesson to be kind and never judge anyone.",
