  "input": "",
  "output": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on global economic markets. Stock markets have experienced unprecedented volatility as investors grapple with both the health crisis and its economic consequences. This has caused many companies to suffer major losses and affected countries worldwide. Economies that had already been struggling before the pandemic are now suffering even more as the virus continues to spread. In the short-term, there has been a reduction in consumption and investment, resulting in a contraction of economic activity. In the long-term, it is likely that the global economy will suffer from ongoing economic uncertainty, volatile financial markets, disrupted supply chains, and rising unemployment.",
