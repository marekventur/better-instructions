  "input": "",
  "output": "If we increase the temperature, the rate of chemical reactions could speed up, and the energy and heat of the environment could change. Depending on the amount of increase, this could have further consequences such as melting of ices sheets, rising sea levels and changes in the distribution of climate zones.",
