  "output": "Chapter 6 of Moby Dick begins with Ishmael heading to sea in search of a whale. He and his crew find a great white whale that they nickname 'Moby Dick' and they pursue it. After several days they finally manage to fire two of their harpoons into the beast. However, this leads to an intense battle between the crew and Moby Dick, during which they manage to damage the whale but suffer considerable damage themselves. In the end, though, they manage to escape alive, albeit much worse for wear.",
