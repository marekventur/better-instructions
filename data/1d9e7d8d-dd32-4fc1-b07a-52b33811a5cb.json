  "input": "",
  "output": "China\u2019s economy has been booming in recent years, with data indicating an average economic growth rate of around 6.7 percent in the last three years. Employment trends have been strong, and the government\u2019s ongoing efforts to rein in debt have created a stable financial market. China\u2019s move towards a consumer based economy is encouraging further growth, with indicators pointing towards a continuing this trend in the near future. Although faced with headwinds from US-China trade tensions, Chinese leaders remain confident about the strength of their economy and their ability to weather any potential related issues. The Chinese consumer has become an increasingly important factor in the global economy, and with rising income levels, consumer spending is making a larger contribution to China's growth. Overall, China's economy looks set to remain strong in the near term.",
