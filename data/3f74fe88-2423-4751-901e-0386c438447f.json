  "input": "Aesthetic-Usability Effect & User Control and Freedom",
  "output": "The Aesthetic-Usability Effect suggests that better design aesthetics lead to better usability by making an interface more intuitive for users. User Control and Freedom, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of providing users with autonomy and freedom by allowing them to undo, redo and make changes. While the Aesthetic-Usability Effect is about designing for intuitive usability, User Control and Freedom is about allowing users to have control and make modifications whenever necessary.",
