  "input": "",
  "output": "A steam engine is a type of engine that utilizes steam created by boiling water to create mechanical energy. It works by heating water through combustion of fuel or with other sources of heat, such as electricity or fossil fuels, and converts the water into high-pressure steam. This steam then enters and expands in a cylinder and can move a piston, creating mechanical energy to turn a wheel or turbine. The exhausted steam is then cooled and condensed back into a liquid, and the cycle can be repeated.",
