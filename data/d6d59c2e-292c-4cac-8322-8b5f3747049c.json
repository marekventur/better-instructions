  "instruction": "Search the web and explain how global warming affects the polar ice caps.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Global warming is causing the polar ice caps to melt at a rapid rate, leading to rising water levels and devastating coastal erosion. As the polar ice caps shrink, the darker ocean below absorbs more heat and causes air temperature to rise further, creating a positive feedback loop. This causes additional meltwater to be released and accelerates the rise in sea levels.",
