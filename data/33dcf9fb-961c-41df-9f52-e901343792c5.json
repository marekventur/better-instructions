  "output": "I once had to work on a project with someone I didn't get along with. It was difficult to collaborate because we had different opinions and weren't on the same page. It was hard to focus on the task when we were constantly at odds. It was discouraging, because I couldn't do my best work with such an obstructive partner. However, I was able to press on and complete the project successfully, even though it was under trying conditions.",
