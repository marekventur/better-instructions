  "input": "",
  "output": "A web developer can add interactivity to a web page by using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. HTML is used to structure the page, while JavaScript can be used to add interactive elements like drop-down menus, pop-up windows, and animations. CSS can be used to create animations and transitions, change the layout of elements, and alter the look and feel of the page to make it more user-friendly.",
