  "input": "",
  "output": "Pros:\n1. Cloning could help to conserve endangered species or provide organs for medical uses. \n2. Cloning could be used to reproduce endangered species or restore extinct species. \n3. Cloning could be used to grow livestock without the presence of disease.\n\nCons:\n1. Cloning could lead to the potential for misuse, such as for mass production of soldiers for an army.\n2. There is the risk of erratic mutations, which could lead to dangerous health defects in the clones. \n3. Cloning could hinder genetic diversity, which could lead to more severe health concerns in humans.",
