  "output": "Write a program that takes a number n as input and prints the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, if the input number is 10, the program should output 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34. \n\nNote: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
