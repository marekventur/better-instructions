  "output": "John and Maria were two people from different backgrounds. John grew up in a small town in the Midwest and enjoyed spending time outdoors. Maria was raised in a larger city and grew up surrounded by a vibrant culture and diverse people. Though they were very different, they became fast friends when they met in college.\n\nThey quickly found common ground in their shared interest of exploring the outdoors. John took Maria to some of the hidden gems of his childhood and Maria shared stories from her travels in far off places. As the days passed, they found that their friendship went beyond those shared experiences. They now shared a bond that allowed them to talk about anything and everything, and their friendship grew even stronger due to their differences.\n\nIt was these differences that made their friendship so strong, and it was because of them that their friendship would last a lifetime.",
