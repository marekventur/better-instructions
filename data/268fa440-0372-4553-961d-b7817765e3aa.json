  "output": "Math is more than simple numbers,\nHelping us construct a new design.\nThough baffling at first, it soon discovers\nThe solution if we ponder and refine.\n\nLines of thoughts seen from many angles,\nFascinating, so intricate and profound.\nSomething familiar, yet ever strange,\nA search for a solution is what\u2019s found.\n\nSeeing math as equations and symbols,\nComplex numbers and equations unraveled.\nA flow chart of shapes and lines, \nTo discover the path that soon traveled.\n\nIt\u2019s more than studying books and equations,\nConsiderations and implications galore.\nDeveloping skills that are expressions,\nAnswers that in the future may soar.\n\nMath is quite interesting, insightful and fun,\nIt helps us to learn and add in some joy.\nFor us today, and long into tomorrow, \nIn some form, math will be our ally.",
