  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce plastic waste in the environment is to switch to sustainable alternatives like biodegradable plastics or compostable materials. Industries can also reduce their reliance on plastic by shifting away from single-use plastics and moving towards reusable and recycled materials where possible. Consumers can opt for reusable bags and containers when grocery shopping and avoiding single-use plastic items, such as straws. Governments can also enact legislation and encourage businesses to use reusable packaging and encourage the use of refillable containers.",
