It focuses on writing reusable expressions.\nImperative programming | It relies on instructions and is procedural in nature. The order of instructions determines the output.\nObject-oriented programming | It focuses on creating objects from classes and using them to represent data and code. \nLogic programming | It uses a declarative approach to form a set of sentences in a logical form and uses deduction to solve problems.\nDeclarative programming | It focuses on describing the problem and its solution instead of providing instructions on how to solve it. \nEvent-driven programming | It relies on events and triggers to run responses to these events. It is often used in web applications. \nScripting programming | It focuses on writing scripts that can be used to automate tasks.",
