  "instruction": "Given a material, describe a process or recipe on how to make it.",
  "input": "Cement",
  "output": "Cement is made using a mixture of calcium and silica-rich materials such as limestone, clay, sand, and shales. This material is heated in a kiln to a high temperature of about 2700\u00b0F, which bonds the materials together and creates a hardened cement. The cement is then cooled off and mixed with a fine aggregate and water to form a slurry. The slurry is then poured into molds to form the desired shape.",
