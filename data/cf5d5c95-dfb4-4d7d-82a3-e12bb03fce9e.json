  "output": "Climate change has had a significant effect on wildlife, resulting in species extinction, altered migration patterns, and changes in the availability of food and shelter. Rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and intense storms have led to decreased survival of some species and destruction of crucial habitats. Climate change will lead to further species extinction, disruption of animal behavior, and destruction of more habitats if the global temperature continues to rise.",
