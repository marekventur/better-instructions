  "input": "",
  "output": "Deep learning is a type of machine learning algorithm where a computer model learns through a hierarchical approach of abstraction. It is based on paradigms of artificial neural networks, where layers of neurons are trained with large sets of data to identify patterns, make predictions, and solve complex problems. The more data used in the training process, the more powerful the deep learning algorithm becomes.",
