  "input": "",
  "output": "Neural networks can be used to predict stock prices by analyzing stock market data such as past prices, the performance of certain stocks, news events, and other data related to the stock market. The neural networks use this data to learn patterns about stock prices and then use the patterns to make predictions about future stock prices. This type of predictive modeling has been found to be very accurate in many cases and can be used to make more informed investing decisions.",
