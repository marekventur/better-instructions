The turtle is surrounded by the phrase \"Sometimes you just need a break\" in a creative font. Underneath it, the words \"This is why I always carry my own shell\" appear in a fun font. The colors for the shirt could be a light grey or khaki for the turtle and the backpack and a bright blue for the text.",
