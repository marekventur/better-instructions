  "instruction": "Suppose I have a big project due tomorrow, but I just find out there is a problem with my computer. What should I do?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "If you find out there is a problem with your computer just before a big project is due, your first priority should be to look into alternative solutions. If you cannot fix the issue yourself, reach out to your IT department or an IT professional and describe the issue. If it is too late to contact anyone, see if you can borrow a friend's computer or use a public computer at a library or cafe. Do your best to complete the project on time, and get your computer fixed as soon as you can.",
