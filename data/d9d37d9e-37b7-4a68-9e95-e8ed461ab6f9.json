  "input": "",
  "output": "Using descriptive variable names in programming is important because it allows the code to be more easily read and understood by anyone familiar with the programming language. When variables are named descriptively, it provides more context to what the code is doing, making it easier to identify errors and think of solutions to problems. It also allows the code to be more self-documenting, making it easier for someone unfamiliar with the code to get a good understanding of what the code is doing.",
