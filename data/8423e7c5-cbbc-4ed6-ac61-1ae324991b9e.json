  "output": "I/O stands for input/output, and it is one of the fundamental concepts in operating systems. It refers to the communication between a device and its user or another system. For example, when you type into a keyboard, the keyboard is sending an input to the operating system which then does something with the information. Similarly, if the operating system wants to display something on the screen, it is sending an output to the display device.",
