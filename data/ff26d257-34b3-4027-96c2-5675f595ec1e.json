  "output": "A typical day for a data scientist working remotely usually begins by checking emails and Slack messages. After which, they sit down to work on their assigned tasks, often writing code to analyze data and creating data visualizations and models. During the day, they will typically chat with team members and troubleshoot problems. In the afternoon, they may join a virtual meeting to discuss progress or review any new developments. After working hours, they wrap up and finish attending to any pending tasks, emails, or meetings.",
