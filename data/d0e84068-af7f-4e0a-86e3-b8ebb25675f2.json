  "output": "Once upon a time, deep in the woods lived a rabbit named Rabbit. He was not an adventurous soul, unlike his neighbor, a bold and brave squirrel named Squirrely. Rabbit liked the peace and quiet of the forest, but Squirrely was always looking for new and exciting places to explore.\n\nOne day, Squirrely persuaded Rabbit to join him on an outing. Rabbit was hesitant at first, but eventually, he joined Squirrely on his daring adventure. Together they explored all the nooks and crannies of the forest, and even bravely crossed a bridge, which was a first for Rabbit.\n\nThe adventure turned out to be a success, and Rabbit was forever changed by the experience. He found that he no longer felt so scared to try new things - a big surprise to his friend Squirrely. From then on, the two friends went on many more adventures together!",
