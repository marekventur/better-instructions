  "instruction": "Come up with a new way to group and visualize this data.",
  "input": "Subject | Grade \nMathematics | A\nEnglish | B\nScience | C",
  "output": "The data could be grouped and visualized using a Venn diagram that shows the subjects along with their respective grades. The overlapping circles could show the subject in the middle, with the grade being represented inside each circle. This visualization would quickly provide visual insights on how the subjects differ in terms of their grades.",
