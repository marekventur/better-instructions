  "output": "To cook fried potatoes, start by peeling and cutting potatoes into cubes. Place the cubes in a large bowl and add salt and pepper to taste. In a separate bowl, combine flour and any other spices you like. Heat oil in a pan until it is hot and add the potato cubes to the pan. Fry until they are golden-brown, stirring occasionally. Remove the potatoes from the pan and drain the excess oil with a paper towel. Enjoy!",
