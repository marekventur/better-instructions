  "output": "Three problems posed by climate change include rising sea levels, changing weather patterns, and extreme weather events. Rising sea levels threaten low-lying coastal communities and are caused by melting ice and the expansion of the ocean due to increasing temperatures. Changing weather patterns can affect farmers\u2019 ability to produce crops, as well as having an effect on the habitats of certain animal species. Extreme weather events, like droughts and floods, can cause destruction and disruption to communities, economies, and ecosystems.",
