  "input": "",
  "output": "Deforestation is a major contributor to global climate change. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but without them, more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. This, in turn, leads to an increase in average temperatures and changes in weather patterns. Additionally, loss of forests impacts local and global biodiversity, soil fertility, and water cycles.",
