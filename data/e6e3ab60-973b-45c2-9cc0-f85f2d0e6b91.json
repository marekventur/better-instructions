  "output": "The sun was starting to set as two strangers met in the park. One was a tall man with an air of confidence about him, the other a petite woman who seemed to blend in to the evening sky. \n\nThe man held out his hand to the woman and said, \u201cHi, I\u2019m John. What\u2019s your name?\u201d She replied with a shy smile, \u201cI\u2019m Sarah.\u201d\n\nThey talked for hours, sharing stories of their lives and their dreams. For the first time in a long time, Sarah felt like she could be herself and feel comfortable without the worry that came with knowing other people for so long.\n\nWhen the evening was coming to a close, John gave Sarah his number and told her to give him a call when she was free so they could grab coffee or go for a walk in the park. With a lingering smile, Sarah said goodbye and turned away. \n\nIt had been one of the most fulfilling conversations she had ever had, and one she looked forward to repeating in the near future.",
