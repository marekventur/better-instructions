  "input": "",
  "output": "Facial recognition technology used in security systems can come in many forms, such as biometrics-based authentication, 3-D face recognition, or the use of algorithms to detect facial features. Biometrics-based authentication requires users to provide physical attributes such as fingerprints, iris scans, and facial recognition for access. 3-D face recognition is more secure and uses more than two-dimensional image recognition to identify a person. Algorithms can detect the shape, size, and position of facial features, allowing for more accurate verification.",
