  "output": "The Reformation and the Counter-Reformation were movements that occurred in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries. The Reformation was a movement led by Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther, and it was focused on introducing reforms to the Catholic Church. The Counter-Reformation was a response to the Reformation from within the Catholic Church, and it was focused on reinforcing Catholic doctrines, strengthening certain Church practices, and reformulating Catholic theology. Both movements had a major impact on European religion, politics, and daily life.",
