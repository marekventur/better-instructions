  "input": "",
  "output": "Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions and play a critical role in metabolism. The relationship between an enzyme and its substrate is that the substrate binds to the enzyme, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. This causes a reaction to occur as the enzyme catalyzes the breakdown of the substrate into products.",
