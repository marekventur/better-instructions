  "instruction": "What is histogram equalization?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Histogram equalization is a process that adjusts the contrast of a digital image by increasing the intensity of pixel maximums and minimums. This allows shadows and highlights of an image to be more evenly represented and provides a better balance of contrast between the images. The result is a sharper image with more uniform colors which is useful in many image processing applications.",
