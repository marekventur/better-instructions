  "instruction": "Predict the outcome of a game of chess given the following board.",
  "input": "Image of a chess board",
  "output": "Given the chess board shown, it is difficult to make an accurate prediction of the outcome of the game, as many pieces are still in their starting positions and there is limited information available. However, the White pieces appear to have a slightly stronger presence on the board, with more pieces in play and some pawns close to promotion. Therefore, it would seem that White is in a better position to win the game.",
