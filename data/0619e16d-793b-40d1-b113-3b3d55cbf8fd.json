  "input": "",
  "output": "It is essential to protect our planet\u2019s coral reefs, not only for their environmental importance, but also for their invaluable economic, scientific, and cultural significance. Coral reefs host an abundance of wildlife, and they provide essential resources to the planet\u2019s marine ecosystems. They also act as support structures for shorelines, protecting them from erosion, floods, and hurricanes. Coral reefs also generate a large portion of the world\u2019s economic activity, as they attract tourists, create jobs, and bring in valuable resources. Coral reefs are also essential to scientific research, as they can provide information about Earth\u2019s past climate states, while their archaeological and historical value is invaluable. We all must do our part to protect and preserve our planet\u2019s coral reefs before it is too late. #Oceans #Conservation #CoralReefs",
