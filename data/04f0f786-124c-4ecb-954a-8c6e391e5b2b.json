  "output": "Gun control laws are necessary to protect the safety of citizens in the United States. Gun violence continues to plague our nation, and the only way to reduce it is to enact stricter regulations on how guns are obtained, used, and stored. Gun control laws can save lives by preventing criminals and people with mental illness from accessing firearms, reducing the number of mass shootings, and limiting access to firearms for potential suicide victims. Further, gun control laws can prevent unintentional shootings and reduce the risk of gun-related violence.",
