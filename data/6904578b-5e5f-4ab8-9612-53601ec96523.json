  "input": "",
  "output": "One healthcare policy to improve access to primary care would be to implement a federally funded universal primary care program. This program could provide free or reduced rate primary care visits, prescriptions, and preventive screenings. It could also include financial incentives for primary care physicians to provide care in underserved communities. Additionally, the program could focus on providing access to primary care for those with low incomes and those who are uninsured or underinsured.",
