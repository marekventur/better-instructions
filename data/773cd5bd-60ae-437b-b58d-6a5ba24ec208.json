  "input": "Angle of arc = 90\u00b0\nRadius = 5m",
  "output": "The length of an arc with an angle of 90\u00b0 and a radius of 5m is 8.66m. This can be calculated using the formula L = r\u03b8, where L is the arc length, r is the radius, and \u03b8 is the angle in radians. In this case, \u03b8 = pi/2, so the arc length is 8.66m.",
