  "output": "The relationship between economic status and crime in the United States is complex and has been the subject of much research and debate. Generally, it has been established that individuals who live in low-income neighborhoods are more prone to committing crime, both due to a lack of opportunity and a sense of disillusionment and hopelessness. Studies have also found that reducing inequality could lead to a decrease in crime rates. Additionally, the availability of social programs, such as job training and education, have been shown to have a significant impact on reducing crime.",
