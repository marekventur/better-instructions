  "input": "Coronavirus vaccine development",
  "output": "The process of developing a coronavirus vaccine starts with identifying and characterizing the virus. Scientists use laboratory techniques to study the genetic material of the virus and identify potential targets for a vaccine. New techniques such as mRNA technology are used to develop a prototype vaccine. Once a prototype is developed, it is tested in animal models and clinical trials in humans. If the efficacy and safety of the vaccine is proven, it is produced and made available for public use.",
