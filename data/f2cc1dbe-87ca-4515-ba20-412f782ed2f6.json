  "input": "",
  "output": "Magnetic fields can be used for energy in a variety of ways. Magnetic energy can be harnessed for power generation in the form of generators or turbines, as well as for powering electric motors. Magnets can also be used to concentrate and convert sunlight into usable energy. Additionally, magnetic fields can be used to increase the efficiency of batteries, making it possible to store more energy while using less. Finally, magnetic fields can be used to transmit energy wirelessly, making it possible to power appliances and devices without the need for a physical connection.",
