  "output": "White is in the dominant position as they have more pieces (4 rooks, 2 knights and 4 queens) than Black. Additionally, most of White\u2019s pieces are clustered together making it strategically powerful. Black is restricted to eight pawns and has no pieces to counteract White\u2019s forces.",
