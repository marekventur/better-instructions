  "input": "Condition: Cystic Fibrosis",
  "output": "Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It is caused by a defective gene that alters the way cells secrete salt and water into the body. This results in thick, sticky mucus that can clog the lungs and lead to frequent infections and serious lung damage. Symptoms may include coughing with phlegm, difficulty breathing, poor growth, frequent chest infections, easy tireness and digestive issues such as constipation and problems gaining weight. If not treated early, the disease can be life-threatening.",
