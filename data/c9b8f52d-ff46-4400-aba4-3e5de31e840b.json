  "instruction": "Write a carefully-devised plan for promoting a new product.",
  "input": "Product Name: Social Media Management Tool",
  "output": "The goal of this plan is to effectively promote our new social media management tool to drive high-quality customer acquisition. To do this, we will use a combination of strategic advertising, influencer marketing, and content strategy. \n\nFirst, we will use keyword-specific targeting, geo-targeting, and remarketing techniques to ensure our ads are reaching our target market. We will also use influencers to reach out to prospective customers, highlight the tool's benefits, and generate more engagement. \n\nSecondly, we will use content focused on demonstrating the tool's features, solving customer pain points, and how our product can help them achieve their goals. This content will be featured on our own website and social media channels, as well as through industry-specific websites and newsletters, to create more visibility and brand recognition.\n\nFinally, to ensure our efforts remain successful, we will monitor and measure our progress using analytics and feedback from customers to refine and optimize our campaigns.",
