  "instruction": "Take a position on the following issue.",
  "input": "Issue: Should professional athletes be paid more?",
  "output": "I believe that professional athletes should be paid competitive salaries that are commensurate with their level of skill and dedication to the sport. Professional athletes dedicate countless hours of practice and training, and they generate vast amounts of money for their teams and leagues. Accordingly, they should receive salaries that reflect their contributions and allow them to lead comfortable lives. In addition, competitive salary levels can help to attract and retain high-quality athletes, which can benefit both players and teams.",
