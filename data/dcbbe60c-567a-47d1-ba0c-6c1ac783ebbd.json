  "output": "The political process for passing a law can be complex and lengthy. Generally, the process begins with an idea that is developed into a bill and then presented to the total legislature. Once in the legislature, the measure is debated, possibly amended, and then voted on. Once the bill passes both chambers of the legislature, it is sent to the executive branch for approval. If the measure is approved by the executive, it becomes a law. If it is not approved, it fails and the process begins anew, or the legislature may attempt to override the executive\u2019s decision.",
