  "output": "I recently watched the movie Joker (2019), starring Joaquin Phoenix. The movie follows the journey of a man struggling with mental illness and the tumultuous journey it takes him on. Through the movie, he learns the power of his own voice and how he can use it to his own advantage. The story is dark yet inspiring, and Joaquin Phoenix gives remarkable performance as the Joker. His heartbreaking portrayal of a troubled man helps to drive home the message of the movie and to give us a glimpse into the struggles of living with mental illness.",
