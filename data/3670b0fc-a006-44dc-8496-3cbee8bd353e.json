  "input": "",
  "output": "Light pollution is the excessive use of artificial light at night that can disrupt natural cycles, affect wildlife, disrupt human health and impair visibility. Research has found that light pollution affects birds\u2019 migratory patterns, interferes with fireflies\u2019 communication signals and can disrupt the reproductive rhythms of some species of mammals. It can lead to increased levels of air and light pollution, light trespass, glare and sky glow. Light pollution can also reduce night sky visibility and may reduce water quality by disrupting the nocturnal movements of aquatic organisms.",
