  "input": "",
  "output": "Global warming is a serious environmental threat to human life because of its effect on the climate. As temperatures rise due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, the planet's climate changes and extreme weather conditions become more common. This affects food and water availability, air quality, disease prevalence and coastal habitability. Global warming also contributes to sea level rise, which is likely to cause major displacement of millions of people across the globe. As temperatures rise, heat waves become longer and more intense, leading to increased mortality rates. Global warming also threatens ecosystems, causing widespread extinctions of species and disrupting biodiversity on a global scale.",
