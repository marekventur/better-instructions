  "input": "",
  "output": "Cyber-crime is an unlawful act committed via the internet or other electronic means. Common examples of cyber-crime include identity theft, phishing and malware attacks. \n\nIdentity theft is the practice of stealing and using someone else\u2019s identity for malicious purposes, such as applying for bank loans and credit cards in another person\u2019s name. \n\nPhishing is a type of cyber-crime where criminals send emails and messages that appear to be from a legitimate organization, such as a bank or online retailer, in an attempt to obtain personal information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. \n\nMalware attacks are malicious software programs designed to infiltrate a computer system and steal information. Examples include ransomware, which encrypts files and demands payment in exchange for the files to be unlocked, and spyware, which secretly retrieves and transmits information from a user\u2019s computer without their knowledge. \n\nThese are just a few examples of cyber-crimes, though new ones are constantly being developed. It is important for users to remain aware of the latest cyber-crime threats, practice caution when using the internet, and be sure to use security software, firewalls, and other protective measures.",
