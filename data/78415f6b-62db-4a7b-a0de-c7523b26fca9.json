  "input": "",
  "output": "Readjusting to civilian life after a period of military service is often a difficult transition. It can involve struggles such as identifying a new purpose after leaving a structured military environment, developing a new network of civilian friends, dealing with post-traumatic stress, and becoming reacquainted with family members. It is important to not act hastily and to give oneself time to Readjust. Seeking out support groups such as veteran resources, talking to mental health care professionals, and slowly transitioning into a new job or education are all important steps to take in the readjustment process.",
