  "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and sugars. It involves the transfer of electrons and protons between molecules as chlorophyll in the presence of light absorbs the light energy used to drive the reaction. The oxygen produced is released into the atmosphere, and the sugar produced is used by the plant for growth.",
