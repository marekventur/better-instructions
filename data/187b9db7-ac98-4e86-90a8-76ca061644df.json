  "instruction": "Identify the necessary parts of a basic introduction paragraph.",
  "input": "Noinput",
  "output": "A basic introduction paragraph typically contains a hook, some background information, and a thesis statement. The hook is an interesting statement that draws readers in and entices them to read on. It can be a quote, a rhetorical question, or a strong statement. The background information should provide context for the thesis, and should be relevant to the topic. Finally, the thesis statement is the main point of the paragraph and should be clearly stated so that the reader knows exactly what to expect in the rest of the essay.",
