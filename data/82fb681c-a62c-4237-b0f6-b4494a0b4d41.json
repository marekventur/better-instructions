  "output": "The United Nations was established in 1945, at the conclusion of World War II. Its founders were determined to prevent future wars by promoting collective security, respecting one another's sovereignty, and promoting economic progress. Its founding document, The Charter of the United Nations, laid out a vision for a peace-keeping organization dedicated to meditating international disputes and promoting global cooperation. The Charter also outlined the establishment of a Security Council, the General Assembly, and the International Court of Justice.\n\nThe signing of the Charter was followed by the ratification of the United Nations\u2019 International Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. This document laid out fundamental human rights that would serve as the basis for many international treaties, and the implementation of these rights within the UN\u2019s own system of protection.\n\nThe United Nations has since grown to include 193 members and has had a considerable effect on global affairs. It has taken a leading role in addressing issues such as global poverty, inequality and the spread of HIV/AIDS, as well as tackling the threats posed by climate change and terrorism.",
