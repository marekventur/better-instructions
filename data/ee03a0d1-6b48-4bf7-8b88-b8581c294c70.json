  "output": "It was a cold winter night, as Peter drove home from work. He was tired but focused on the road until, out of nowhere, a car driving in the opposite direction suddenly swerved into his lane. Peter slammed on his brakes but it was too late and he collided with the other car. When the dust settled, he got out of his car and saw a woman inside the other vehicle. She was badly injured and was rushed to the nearest hospital. Despite being en route to recovery, the woman's family was still shaken from the incident, and Peter was left with a feeling of guilt and regret.",
