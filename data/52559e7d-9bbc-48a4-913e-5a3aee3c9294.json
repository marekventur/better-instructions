  "input": "My desk is always cluttered",
  "output": "A creative approach to solving this problem is to give each item in your desk a designated \"home\". Use labeled bins, trays, and folders to store your items in an organized way. This way, you will know exactly where each item needs to go when you're done using it and when it's time to clean up.  Additionally, you can use cubbies and hanging shelves to store items off your desk and to avoid clutter. An added bonus? It also adds to the overall aesthetic of your space.",
