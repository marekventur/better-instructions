  "output": "Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that records transactions across a peer-to-peer network. It is used to securely store and share data, without the need for a central authority. \n\nEach transaction that is added to the blockchain is secured with a cryptographic hash and digitally signed by the user who created it. This allows for a secure and tamper-proof way of verifying and recording transactions.\n\nThe data in the blockchain is stored in blocks, where each block is linked to the previous block. This block chain is resistant to alterations and can only be updated with the consensus of the network. These blocks are linked with a cryptographic hash, so that any changes made to the data will be immediately detected.\n\nBlockchain technology has a wide range of applications beyond digital currency, such as identity management, smart contracts, data storage, and verification of digital assets.",
