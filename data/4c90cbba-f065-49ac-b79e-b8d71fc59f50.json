  "instruction": "Choose a topic and create a creative approach for a marketing campaign for it.",
  "input": "Veganism",
  "output": "A great marketing strategy for promoting veganism would be to create a series of entertaining and informative videos, highlighting the benefits of veganism and showcasing vegan dishes prepared in interesting, delicious ways. In addition, unique and memorable hashtags could be created in order to emphasize the main message and draw attention to the topic. Through social media and word of mouth, it will be possible to spread awareness and help educate people on veganism and its benefits. A presence on social media channels such as YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter could be used to track metrics such as likes, views, and comments in order to measure the success of the campaign and create more content that people are interested in.",
