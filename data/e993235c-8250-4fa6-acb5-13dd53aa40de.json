  "input": "",
  "output": "The consequences of a monopoly can be severe and far-reaching. A monopoly allows a company to set prices that are too high and can lead to decreased competition, stifled innovation, and reduced consumer choice. Furthermore, monopolistic companies often have the ability and incentive to reduce quality in order to bolster their profits. This can lead to increased dissatisfaction among customers and potential legal action against the company. In addition, monopolies can lead to a decrease in economic efficiency, as resources are wasted and capital is inefficiently allocated.",
