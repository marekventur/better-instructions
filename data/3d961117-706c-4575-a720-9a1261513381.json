  "output": "Dear Customer Service Representatives,\n\nI am writing to express my disappointment with the customer service I experienced when attempting to purchase a laptop online. \n\nI had filled up my cart with the items I wanted and was ready to check out when the system unexpectedly crashed. Unfortunately, I was unable to pay for the items and had to start again from the beginning due to the crash. This was a very poor customer service experience and completely disrupted what should have been a smooth purchasing process.\n\nI appreciate that technology issues can arise, however, I would expect a more seamless process and better customer experience next time I attempt to make a purchase. \n\nThanks for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely, \n[Your Name]",
