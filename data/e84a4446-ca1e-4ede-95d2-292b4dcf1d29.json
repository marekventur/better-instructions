  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce water use in the home is to install low-flow plumbing fixtures such as showerheads, faucets, and toilets. Low flow plumbing fixture designs allow for water savings of up to 50% when compared to traditional fixtures. Additionally, investing in a tankless water heater can help reduce water waste and provide an unlimited supply of hot water. Finally, installing or repairing leaky fixtures, such as faucets and toilets, can also help conserve water in the home.",
