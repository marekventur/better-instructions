  "output": "Verse 1:\nPlants need sunlight to survive,\nIt\u2019s a fact of life not meant to be denied. \nWithout the sun, they can\u2019t thrive,\nSo listen close to hear the reason why.\n\nChorus: \nThey need sun and rain,\nJust a little bit of each,\nFor plants to grow and reach maturity. \n\nVerse 2: \nTo keep leaves healthy, from the start,\nThey turn chlorophyll towards the light. \nIt\u2019s an essential part,\nFor a plant to put up a fight. \n\nChorus: \nThey need sun and rain,\nJust a little bit of each,\nFor plants to grow and reach maturity. \n\nBridge:\nWithout the sun, all the plants would die,\nBut what is the sun and where does it come from? \nIt\u2019s a big yellow star in the sky,\nSo we can thank it every day for being our energy source by and by. \n\nOutro:\nSo thank you to the sun,\nNature\u2019s source of light,\nIt's thanks to it that makes us smile each night.",
