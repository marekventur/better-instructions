  "output": "Mitosis is the process by which cells divide to produce two identical copies of themselves. It consists of four major phases: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During prophase, the chromatin of the cell condenses and the nucleus breaks down. During prometaphase, the nuclear envelope is disassembled and microtubules attach to each chromosome pair. In metaphase, the chromosome pairs align along the center of the cell, called the metaphase plate. During anaphase, the sister chromatids separate and move to opposite ends of the cell. Finally, during telophase, the spindle fibers disappear and the nuclear envelope reforms.",
