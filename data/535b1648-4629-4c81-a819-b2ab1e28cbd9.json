  "input": "",
  "output": "A bee's life is filled with activity, gathering nectar and pollen from flowers and other plants. They visit dozens of flowers a day, spending an average of 20 minutes per flower. Bees transfer pollen from plant to plant, aiding in pollination and allowing plants to reproduce. They then return to their hive with the nectar and pollen they have collected, where it is used to feed the colony and its queen. A bee's life is full of hard work and labor, but it is incredibly important to the survival of our environment. Without bees, many of the plants that we rely on for food and beauty would cease to exist.",
