  "input": "",
  "output": "Rising sea levels can have significant impacts on coastal areas. As the sea level rises, it causes coastal flooding which can lead to loss of property, reduce access to clean drinking water, contaminate drinking water sources, and reduce access to recreational places. Additionally, rising sea levels can lead to increased erosion of coastlines, which can cause damage to homes or buildings that are built too close to the coast.",
