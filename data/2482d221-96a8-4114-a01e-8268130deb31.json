  "output": "The key themes of Robert Frost\u2019s poem \"The Road Not Taken\" are decision making, personal freedom, and regret. The poem follows a narrator as they consider two divergent paths and ultimately make a choice. Despite choosing the less-traveled path and believing it has made all the difference, there is an underlying sense of regret that comes with the risk and uncertainty of the unknown.",
