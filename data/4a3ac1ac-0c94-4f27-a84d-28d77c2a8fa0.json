  "instruction": "Develop an AI system to monitor credit card usage.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The AI system should be able to monitor credit card activity and detect suspicious activity. It should be able to detect patterns in the user\u2019s spending habits, and flag any deviations from the expected behavior. The system should also be able to detect anomalies in transaction amounts and frequency. Furthermore, it should be able to detect multiple credit cards of the same user, and generate alerts if behavior on one card differs significantly from behavior on the other. Finally, the system should be able to generate reports and alerts, that can be viewed in an intuitive dashboard.",
