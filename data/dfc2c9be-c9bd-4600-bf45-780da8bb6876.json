  "input": "",
  "output": "The Hippo signaling pathway is a conserved mechanism used to regulate organ size in animals. It was first discovered in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster in the early 2000s, when scientists identified mutations causing a severe overgrowth in some fly species. Through further research, mammalian homologs of the fruit fly Hippo components were found, and the Hippo pathway was further validated in mammals. Subsequent studies identified a unique role for the Hippo pathway in controlling organ size, tissue regeneration and stem cell maintenance. Many human diseases have been linked to defects in the Hippo pathway, including cancer and developmental disorders.",
