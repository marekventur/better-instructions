  "output": "Ground robots can be used in hazardous environments such as nuclear sites, industrial plants, and disaster areas that are inaccessible or too dangerous for humans. Ground robots are mobile and can navigate complex terrains, and they can be designed to withstand extreme temperatures and radiation. Additionally, they can be equipped with sensors and cameras which makes them valuable for inspection jobs and for exploring confined or dangerous spaces.",
