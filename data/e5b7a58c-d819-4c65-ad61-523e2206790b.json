  "output": "A good strategy to deal with stress is to practice deep breathing exercises. Take deep breaths and hold for a few seconds. This can help to reduce blood pressure, heart rate and relax the mind. Focusing on something that brings joy and happiness can help to reduce stress too. This can be done through engaging in a hobby, listening to music, watching funny movies, or spending time with friends and family. Additionally, it is essential to maintain a balanced lifestyle by getting enough sleep, exercising regularly and eating healthy meals.",
