  "output": "Good morning! Today, I am here to speak about the topic of invasive species and their effects on ecosystems. An invasive species is a species of plants, animals, fungi, or other organisms that are not native to a specific location, and which can cause harm to the environment and native species. Invasive species have negative effects on ecosystems, by out-competing native species, disrupting food webs, and reducing biodiversity. Many countries have already implemented measures to control and stop the spread of invasive species, such as early detection and rapid response programs, public education, and physical and chemical control. Thank you for listening.",
