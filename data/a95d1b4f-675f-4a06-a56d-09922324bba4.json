  "input": "",
  "output": "The economic implications of an aging population are varied and complex. One major impact is that with fewer people of working age, there will be fewer people available to contribute to the economy. This could result in an overall decrease in productivity and production, leading to slower growth. Additionally, with an aging population comes an increase in the need for health care, pensions, and other social services, placing greater strain on budgets. Further, as businesses face higher labor costs and fewer customers, they may be less likely to invest, leading to less job and wage growth.",
