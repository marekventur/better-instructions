  "input": "",
  "output": "One possible solution to reduce availability of guns in society is to introduce tighter gun control laws. These laws could involve background checks for any gun purchases, as well as raising the minimum age to purchase a gun, and requiring a license or permit. Additionally, legislation could be put in place to further restrict the sale of certain types of guns, such as semi-automatic weapons or weapons with large capacity magazines.",
