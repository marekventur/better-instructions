  "input": "The Internet has had a long and convoluted history in Japan since its earliest beginnings in the early 1990s. After some initial experimentation with international networks, Japan opted to develop its own advanced research networks, allowing it to remain ahead of the curve in terms of knowledge and technological innovation. The development of the web played a large role in the growth of the industry, and the creation and adaptation of new technologies and services allowed the Internet to become an integral part of daily life in the nation.",
