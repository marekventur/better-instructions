  "input": "",
  "output": "A computer generates a random number through a process called pseudorandom number generation (PRNG). This involves taking a known number (known as the seed) and applying a mathematical equation to it in order to generate a new number. This number is then used as the seed for the next number, and so on. The randomness of the numbers generated depends on the quality of the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm used. In addition, true randomness can be obtained through the use of external sources such as atmospheric noise, physical devices (e.g., Random.org), or recently captured data from websites.",
