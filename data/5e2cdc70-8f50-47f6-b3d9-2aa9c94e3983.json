  "output": "Binary code is a system of encoding information in which data is stored as a series of 0s and 1s. A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 number system, which consists of only two symbols: 0 and 1. In binary code, each character is represented by a combination of 8 bits, or 0s and 1s. By converting the information into binary code, computers can quickly process data and turn it into instructions for the machine to follow.",
