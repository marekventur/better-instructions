  "output": "An algorithm is a set of precise instructions that are used to solve a problem or accomplish a task. It is more than a basic step-by-step list of instructions, since it must include defined processes and precise rules to be able to complete a task in the most efficient way. Algorithms can be used by computers to complete a wide variety of tasks, such as predicting and analyzing data, problem solving, and automation. Algorithms are a crucial part of computer science and technology, as they are used in almost all computer applications.",
