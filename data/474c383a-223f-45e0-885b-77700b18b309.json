  "input": "",
  "output": "Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, water and geothermal power have the potential to play a major role in reducing the world's dependence on non-renewable energy sources and combatting the effects of climate change. Using renewable energy sources has many benefits, such as providing clean, emissions-free energy, creating jobs in the renewable energy industry, and reducing energy costs through improved energy efficiency. Renewable energy also provides energy security and ensures energy access to populations in rural and remote areas. It also helps to reduce pollution and improves public health. In addition, investing in renewable energy sources can have substantial economic benefits, as renewable energy sources can be a more affordable and reliable source of energy compared to traditional sources.",
