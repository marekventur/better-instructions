  "input": "",
  "output": "An efficient way of organizing papers is to create a filing system that categorizes papers based on specific criteria, so they\u2019re easy to locate when needed. Start by sorting documents into broad categories and create folders for each of these. Then, assign a label to describe each document, making sure to be consistent with the naming scheme. Once documents are sorted into the appropriate folders, you can use a filing cabinet to store them.",
