  "input": "",
  "output": "Bond yield is the rate of return on a bond that an investor receives from owning it. Bond yield is generally expressed as a percentage of the bond's face value and reflects the current market value of the bond. Bond yield usually takes into account the coupon rate, the repayment dates and the current market value of the bond. Bond yield can also be thought of as the rate of return on a bond if it was held until it matures.",
