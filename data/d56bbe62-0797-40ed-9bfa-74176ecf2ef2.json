  "output": "Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the way many tasks in our daily life are performed. They have profoundly impacted business, industry and creativity, while greatly increasing efficiency and improving accuracy. In addition to its easier to perceive benefits like in automation and robotics, AI has also been used to solve more complex tasks like natural language processing, image recognition and autonomous navigation. AI has disrupted our traditional process of problem solving, requiring us to adjust and accept the full potential of the technology. To ensure the beneficial use of AI, it is important to emphasize on ethical questions, protect privacy and also to regulate the potential harms of AI which span a wide variety of domains. Societal impacts of AI range from job displacement or enablement, monitoring and surveillance of citizens, allocation of public benefits and services, to works of art, music, writing and scientific discovery among many other implications.  \n\nAnother important point to consider is the limitation of AI and its role in ensuring its responsible use. Despite the capability of AI to efficiently solve a large number of tasks, it is important to not become over-reliant on the technology and to remain aware of its limitations and risks. AI is still in its development stage and as such, it is not yet capable of replacing human expertise in many areas. Furthermore, it is also important to periodically evaluate the technological advancements to ensure its effective and ethical use.\n\nOverall, AI has the potential to bring many advances in our lives and it should be taken advantage of responsibly by keeping in mind its implication and limitations.",
