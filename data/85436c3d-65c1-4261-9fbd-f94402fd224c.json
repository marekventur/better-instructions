  "output": "Randomness is important for a machine learning system because it allows the system to explore different possibilities and search the space of possible solutions. By introducing a random element, the system can develop new rules and insights, which can lead to better performance. Additionally, randomness helps prevent the system from getting stuck in local optima, or areas of the solution space that may provide an adequate solution but could be improved with more exploration. Randomness also allows for better generalization, as it helps the system to find patterns that are not limited to the training data.",
