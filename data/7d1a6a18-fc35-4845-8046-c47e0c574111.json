  "output": "A simple breakfast recipe that can be made in under 20 minutes is an egg and avocado on toast. All you need is a slice of wholegrain toast, one egg, half an avocado, a sprinkle of salt and pepper, and a tablespoon of olive oil. Start by lightly toasting the bread. Then heat the oil in a frying pan and add the egg. Fry for about 2 minutes until the egg is cooked to desired texture. Meanwhile, cut the avocado in half and spread on the toast. Place the egg on top and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Enjoy!",
