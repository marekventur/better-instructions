  "input": "",
  "output": "Deep in the heart of the forest there lived a mysterious creature. It was said to be a giant beast, with the head of a deer, the body of a lion, and the tail of a dragon. The creature was rarely seen and most of the time lurked out of sight. Those who have been lucky enough to see it whispered awe-inspiring stories of its greatness.\n\nLegends of this mystical creature spread throughout the land, creating fear and fascination in equal measure. Some said it was an omen of good luck, while others believed it was a harbinger of destruction.\n\nRegardless of what it was, the mere presence of the creature was enough to make the local villagers tread carefully and tread lightly in the forest. Even so, the creature, whatever it was, continued to exist in the deep dark unknown.",
