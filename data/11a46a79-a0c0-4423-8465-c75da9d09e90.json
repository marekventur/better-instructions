  "input": "",
  "output": "To make a small fire, you\u2019ll need three things: kindling, tinder, and a heat source. Gather some small sticks, twigs, and pieces of paper to use as kindling. This will help the fire to burn quickly and evenly. Collect grass, leaves, cotton, or small twigs as tinder, which will help the fire to start easily. Finally you'll need either a match or spark rod to ignite the tinder and kindling. Once the fire is burning strongly, add slightly larger pieces of kindling to keep it going.",
