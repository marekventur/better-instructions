  "output": "The Starry Night, painted by Dutch post-impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh in 1889, is one of the most recognizable and beloved works in the world. The painting conveys an array of feelings, from the calm of a peaceful night sky to the chaos of swirling stars and a looming, crescent moon. There are several interpretive elements to the painting, such as the village in the background which seems to represent religious faith, while the stars above seem to represent eternal hope. The Starry Night is a timeless and classic work of art, and will continue to stand the test of time.",
