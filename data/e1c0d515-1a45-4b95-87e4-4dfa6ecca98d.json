  "output": "Good morning everyone. I'm here today to talk to you about why we should all be recycling. Recycling helps to protect our planet by reducing the amount of waste that is sent to our landfills. It also help conserve the materials that are already in our environment, like timber and metals. Additionally, recycling can help to create employment opportunities and contribute to our economy. And lastly, it can help to reduce our reliance on natural resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are contributing to global warming. In short, recycling helps protect our planet and its inhabitants. So let's do our part and make sure that we are all recycling to help preserve our planet for future generations. Thank you.",
