  "output": "A good strategy for eliminating distractions is to establish a routine and to create a distraction-free environment. First, try to set aside a specific time each day for work and focus on completing this task. It may help to turn off phones and notifications for some period of time, or if that isn't possible, disable specific notifications or limit the use of distracting apps.
