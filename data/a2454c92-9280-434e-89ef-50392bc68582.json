  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary difference between static electricity and current electricity is that static electricity is a type of electricity that is stationary, while current electricity is the electricity generated by the movement of electrons. Static electricity is generated by the buildup of electric charges, while current electricity is created by the movement of these charges through an electrical material such as a wire or a circuit.",
