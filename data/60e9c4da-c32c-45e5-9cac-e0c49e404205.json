  "output": "Friend 1: Have you been following the news lately? It seems like the economy is really struggling right now.\n\nFriend 2: Yeah, it\u2019s definitely been a difficult time for many people. Unemployment, inflation, and recession levels have all been on the rise, and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to get better anytime soon.\n\nFriend 1: I know. It\u2019s severely impacting small businesses and causing a lot of people to worry about the future.\n\nFriend 2: Definitely. The government is offering loans and incentives, but those are short-term solutions. We need to find more long-term solutions that focus on developing sustainable economic growth.",
