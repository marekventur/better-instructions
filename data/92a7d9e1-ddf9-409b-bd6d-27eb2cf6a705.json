  "instruction": "Design an application interface that meets the following requirements.",
  "input": "The application should be simple and intuitive to use with minimal user input required.",
  "output": "The user interface should be designed to be both visually appealing and easy to navigate. Start with a simple color palette and minimal graphics. The input form should be concise and easy to understand, with a single action button (e.g., Submit or Search) to provide maximum simplicity. Note that it is important to ensure that the user understands what action they are taking and what the expected outcome will be. Use a clean font and an appropriate number of fields that are clearly labeled so that the user has a clear understanding of what each field is asking for. Additionally, provide helpful hints on how to use the form where necessary.",
