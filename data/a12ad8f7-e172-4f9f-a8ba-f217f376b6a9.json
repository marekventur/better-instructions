  "output": "The main focus of a personal pitch should be to demonstrate how one\u2019s skills and experience can be of value to the company. This should be done by highlighting the strengths and past accomplishments that are relevant to the role, as well as being able to articulate how one\u2019s values and goals would fit into the company\u2019s mission. Additionally, the pitch should be tailored to the particular job and audience, and should also demonstrate a genuine interest in the position and the organization.",
