  "output": "Magnetism is the force of attraction or repulsion between materials due to the alignment of the molecules in the material. All materials respond to the presence of a magnetic field, but the effect is much stronger in materials like iron, cobalt, and nickel which are strongly attracted to the magnetic field and can become magnetized themselves. There are two main types of magnetism: ferromagnetism and diamagnetism. Ferromagnets retain their magnetism when removed from the field and are the most common type of magnets found in everyday items. Diamagnets are repelled by the magnetic field and only display a magnetic property when placed in the field. Magnetism plays an important role in physics, since the force it creates can be used to induce motion of objects.",
