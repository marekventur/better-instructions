  "output": "The Cloud in a Jar Science Experiment is a fun and educational activity for kids. It is a simple experiment that can be conducted with common household items. The goal of the experiment is to show how clouds are formed. To do this, you will need a jar, some ice cubes, a match, a thermometer and a piece of tissue paper. Place the ice cubes in the jar and light a match to create smoke. Put the tissue paper over the opening of the jar and watch as the smoke condenses, forming a cloud inside the jar. By taking a temperature reading you can observe how the air is cooled down and the cloud forms.",
