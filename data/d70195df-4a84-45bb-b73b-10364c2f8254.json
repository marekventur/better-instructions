  "input": "The more scientists study diet and nutrition, the more they understand how important dietary sodium is for overall health. Sodium is an essential nutrient and is a primary electrolyte in the body. It\u2019s needed to regulate hormones and fluids and to maintain acid balance. It also aids in the transmission of nerve impulses, helps muscles contract and relax, and helps stabilize blood pressure. Too little sodium \u2013 hyponatremia \u2013 can be life-threatening, while an imbalance in sodium-potassium levels can lead to other health problems.",
  "output": "Sodium is an essential electrolyte for the body\u2019s overall health. It helps to regulate hormones, maintain fluid and acid balance, as well as transmits nerve impulses, helps muscles and maintains blood pressure. Too little sodium, known as hyponatremia, can be life-threatening, while an imbalance in sodium-potassium levels can lead to serious health issues. Recent research shows that dietary sodium is an important factor in staying healthy, and so it is important to ensure our diets are balanced by providing the right amount of sodium.",
