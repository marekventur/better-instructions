  "input": "Impressionism and Expressionism",
  "output": "Impressionism and Expressionism are two of the most influential art movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. They both sought to capture and evoke emotion as opposed to relying solely on realism. Impressionists focused on capturing a fleeting moment in time and expressing their emotional reaction to their environment, often by using a visible brushstroke to capture the light and atmosphere. Expressionists on the other hand, sought to use colors and forms to explore a deeper emotion, often focusing on depicting darker topics such as fear, despair and anxiety. Despite the differences, both styles focus on the emotions of the artist and capturing light and atmosphere.",
