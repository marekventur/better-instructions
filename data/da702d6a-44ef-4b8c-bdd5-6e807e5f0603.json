  "input": "",
  "output": "React and Angular are both popular open-source web frameworks used to create user interfaces. React is mainly focused on the view layer, so it is simpler and easier to learn. It also has a powerful Virtual DOM, allowing it to render complex web applications quickly. However, it does not have an inbuilt command-line tool, so developers have to use third-party tools for tasks like compiling, routing, and state management. \n\nAngular is more powerful than React, as it provides an end-to-end platform for developing single-page applications. It is also more \u201copinionated\u201d, so there is less risk of introducing errors. On the other hand, it has a steeper learning curve and is more complex compared to React. It also has less flexibility and scalability compared to React.",
