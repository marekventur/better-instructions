  "output": "It was the first day of elementary school for 6 year old Michael. He was both excited and scared as he stepped into the school building, which was bustling with other children that he didn't know. In his classroom, he met his new teacher, Mrs. Smith, who welcomed him with a warm smile and encouraged him to take a seat and make himself comfortable. Michael was awe-struck by the vastness of his new school and the countless books and materials around him. As the day progressed, he learned the rules and anticipations of the school and met his new classmates. He eventually settled into the routine of the school and went home with a new sense of confidence.",
