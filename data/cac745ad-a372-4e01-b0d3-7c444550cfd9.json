  "input": "",
  "output": "The main differences between deep learning and traditional machine learning models are the levels of abstraction they employ. Deep learning models remove the need for feature engineering by creating hierarchical layers of abstraction and processing raw data to extract patterns, while traditional machine learning models require the use of hand-crafted features. Additionally, deep learning models are more accurate than traditional machine learning models.",
