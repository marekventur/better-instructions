  "input": "",
  "output": "Using solar energy is especially beneficial in rural areas where grid electricity is scarce or expensive and with households that require a reliable and affordable energy source. Solar energy technology can provide access to electricity with minimal upfront costs, and it is also easier to maintain and operate than traditional energy sources. Additionally, solar energy has fewer emissions which reduces the impact on the environment.",
