  "input": "",
  "output": "The major cause of the ice age was the drop in global temperature which was caused by a decrease in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This decrease was primarily due to changes in ocean circulation and a decrease in volcanic activity. These changes in turn reduced the total amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth, leading to a drop in global temperatures.",
