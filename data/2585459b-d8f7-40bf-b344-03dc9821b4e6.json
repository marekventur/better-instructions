  "output": "My favorite childhood memory is the annual beach trip my family and I would take. I remember the anticipation I would feel when we would start packing the car - it was like a mini adventure was about to start. We would always make the most of the trip, spending our days exploring the numerous rockpools, having snowball fights, and building sandcastles. The trip always ended with the most incredible sunset, which would bathe the beach in an orange-pink hue. I look back on that trip fondly and can still feel a deep sense of joy when I think about it.",
