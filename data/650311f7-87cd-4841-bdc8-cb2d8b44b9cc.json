  "input": "Task: Prune a rose bush",
  "output": "To prune a rose bush, begin by using sharp pruning shears to remove any dead, diseased, or broken branches. Then, identify any branches that are crossing or rubbing against one another and prune those as well. For branches that are growing inward, downward, or outward, prune back to just outside the bud, at a 45-degree angle. Then, remove any branches that are too close to the center to allow for better air circulation and more light. Finally, shape the bush by cutting away branches that are longer than the desired shape.",
