  "input": "",
  "output": "DNA molecules have a double helix structure, with two strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) wound around each other. Each strand consists of four nitrogenous bases; adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, paired in a specific order. The complementary pairing of nitrogenous bases structurally stabilizes the double helix, and forms the basis for genetic information storage, replication, and expression.",
