  "input": "",
  "output": "The probability of rolling a total of 8 given 3 fair dice is 1/12 or 0.083. This is because the possible combinations that add up to 8 include (5,1,2), (4,2,2), (3,3,2), (2,4,2) and (1,5,2). Since there are a total of 6x6x6=216 possible combinations, the probability of rolling a total of 8 is 1/216.",
