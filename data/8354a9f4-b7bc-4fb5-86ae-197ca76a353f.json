  "input": "",
  "output": "The federal government manages its budget by setting priorities and making financial decisions based on those priorities. The federal budget process begins with the President submitting a budget request to Congress, which includes detailed descriptions of federal spending and revenue. Congress then holds hearings, introduces and considers legislation, and ultimately approves the budget. The President then signs the budget into law and the departments and agencies of the federal government implement the approved budget.",
