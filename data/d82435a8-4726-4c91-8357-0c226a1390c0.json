  "instruction": "Summarize an article about the effect of taxation on economic growth.",
  "input": "The article examines the impact of taxation on economic growth and trends from 1960 to 2008. It finds that taxation has a negative effect on economic growth in the long-term, with a declining impact over this period. The study further finds that lower taxes may be beneficial for growth in the short-term, but the long-term benefits are not significant.",
  "output": "This article examines the correlation between taxation and economic growth from 1960 to 2008 and finds that taxation has a negative impact on economic growth in the long-term. The study also finds that lower taxes may be beneficial in the short-term, but the long-term effects are insignificant. The results suggest that the government should strive to create tax structures that favor growth in the short-term while minimizing any potential long-term negative effects on growth.",
