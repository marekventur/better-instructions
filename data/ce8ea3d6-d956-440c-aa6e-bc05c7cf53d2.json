  "input": "",
  "output": "One argument for mandatory military service is that it could increase the size and quality of military forces. Additionally, mandatory military service has been seen as a form of nation-building and character building, allowing citizens to gain practical skills and experiences, as well as understand the value of military service and learn how to serve and protect their country.\n\nOn the other hand, there are several arguments against mandatory military service. It can be argued that it goes against the ideals of a free society and citizens should be able to make their own decisions as to whether or not they want to serve in the military. Additionally, some argue that military service can be an unnecessary burden on those who would not otherwise choose to enlist, and that resources may be better used in other areas such as education or public health.",
