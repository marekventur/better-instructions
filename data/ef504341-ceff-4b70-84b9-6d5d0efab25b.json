  "instruction": "Train a model to recognize handwritten digits.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The model can be trained using a dataset of images of handwritten digits, along with labels indicating which digit each image corresponds to. The model can measure the accuracy of its predictions and adjust its parameters as needed in order to increase accuracy. A variety of machine learning algorithms can be used for this task, such as convolutional neural networks or support vector machines.",
