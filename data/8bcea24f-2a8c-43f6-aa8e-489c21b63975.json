It also often features industrial gears, clocks and other metallic embellishments. The look is usually accessorized with various handcrafted items like jewelry, watches, walking sticks and parasols. The wearer often sports a unique hairstyle such as a bun or braids. The overall effect is a look that is timeless and yet futuristic.",
