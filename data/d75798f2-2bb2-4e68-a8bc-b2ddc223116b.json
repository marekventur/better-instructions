  "input": "",
  "output": "Neural networks can be used for automated speech recognition by extracting and analyzing the acoustic data from an input signal. Neural networks can detect patterns in the signal and use these patterns to identify the words being spoken. The networks extract features from the signal and use these features to generate a probability distribution of all possible words being spoken. The network then uses this distribution to decide which words are most probable. This process is repeated for each word in the sentence, allowing the network to accurately recognize the speech.",
