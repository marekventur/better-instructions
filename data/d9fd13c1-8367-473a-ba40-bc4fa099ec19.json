  "instruction": "Write a classification algorithm to detect spam emails.",
  "input": "This is an email example:\n\nSubject: Promotional offer\n\nDear Customer,\n\nWe have a special offer in store for you! Get 50% off when you shop today. \n\nClick the link below to find out more.",
  "output": "The algorithm will take the given email and first use natural language processing techniques to tokenize and split the email into its individual words and phrases. The algorithm will then use the bag-of-words technique to convert the text into numerical data represented by a vector of words. \n\nThe algorithm will then use the vector of words as input for a classifier, such as a decision tree, logistic regression, or support vector machine to classify the email as either spam or not spam. The classifier can use several features, including the subject line, words used, and links provided. \n\nThe algorithm will then output a result - either 1 for spam, or 0 for not spam - depending on the input email.",
