  "instruction": "Explain how the hydrogen atom produces an emission spectrum",
  "input": "",
  "output": "When an atom, such as a hydrogen atom, is excited by energy, an electron may transition to a higher energy level. When the electron transitions back down to the ground energy level, it releases the energy in the form of light of a specific wavelength. This results in a emission spectrum, with a number of lines corresponding to atoms that have been excited and released energy of different wavelengths.",
