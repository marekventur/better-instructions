  "input": "I'm considering getting the new PlayStation 5, can you tell me what its capabilities are compared to the Xbox Series X?",
  "output": "The PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X both offer a total of 8 core processors, 16 teraflops of graphical power, and 16GB of memory. However, the PlayStation 5 houses a custom 825GB SSD compared to the 1TB NVMe SSD on the Xbox Series X, allowing for much faster load times and larger data storage capacity. The PlayStation 5 also features a custom designed AMD Graphics Processing Unit, while the Xbox Series X features a slightly more powerful AMD GPU. Finally, the PlayStation 5 features Adaptive Triggers, allowing gamers to feel the tension of gameplay, while the Xbox Series X does not currently offer this feature.",
