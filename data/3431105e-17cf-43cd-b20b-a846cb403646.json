  "instruction": "Justify the given argument and provide evidence to back it up.",
  "input": "It is important to prioritize peace and disarmament when dealing with other countries.",
  "output": "Prioritizing peace and disarmament is critical when dealing with other countries, because it encourages dialogue and negotiation over military aggression and enables us to avoid the destruction that war brings. For example, the diplomatic settlement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2015 helped to ensure that Iran could not develop nuclear weapons, and thereby avoided the possibility of a large-scale conflict in the Middle East. By emphasizing diplomatic solutions and disarmament, we can create lasting peace and stability in the world.",
