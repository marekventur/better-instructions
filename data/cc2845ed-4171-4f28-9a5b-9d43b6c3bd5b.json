  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial intelligence (AI) can help reduce healthcare costs by improving the accuracy and efficiency of medical processes, such as diagnoses and treatments. AI can also be used to create personalized treatment plans based on a patient's individual needs and circumstances. This can significantly reduce the cost of providing treatments, as well as the time required for diagnosis. AI can also be used to analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns in disease, which can lead to improved preventive care and more effective treatments. Additionally, AI can be used to facilitate better coordination and communication within healthcare teams, leading to better care quality and lower costs.",
