  "input": "",
  "output": "Genetic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm that uses principles of evolution and natural selection to find solutions to problems. A genetic algorithm starts with a population of solutions and applies genetic operators such as mutation, selection, and crossover to create new solutions which are evaluated against a fitness function. The most fit solutions are kept and the process is repeated until suitable solutions are found.",
