  "input": "",
  "output": "The cost of renting a house is determined by a number of factors, including the location, size of the house, amenities and features of the house, the landlord's inquiry process, and the local market conditions. Location is a major factor as tenants may prioritize living in an area that is close to where they work, while the size of the house and features such as parking availability and extra living space could also drive up prices. The landlord's inquiry process, including their credit and rental history requirements, security deposits and fees, can also affect the total cost. Finally, the local market conditions, such as the demand for rental properties and the average rent in the area, can also have an effect on what a tenant will be asked to pay for a house.",
