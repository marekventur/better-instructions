  "output": "The scene opens in the bedroom of a young woman. She is curled up in bed, her face filled with sadness. She stares at the ceiling, lost in thought. Flashbacks of past events come unbidden to her mind and tears start to form in her eyes. She tries to distract herself by reading or watching a movie, but nothing works. Eventually she closes her eyes tight, trying to block out the pain, but she finds herself unable to shake off the darkness that has descended over her.",
