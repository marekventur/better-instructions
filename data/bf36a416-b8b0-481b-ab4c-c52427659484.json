  "input": "Gradient Descent",
  "output": "Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm that finds the values of parameters that minimize the cost function. This algorithm works by iteratively taking a small step in the direction of the negative gradient of the cost function, which indicates the direction in which the cost function decreases the fastest.",
