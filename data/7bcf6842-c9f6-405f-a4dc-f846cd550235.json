  "input": "",
  "output": "Creating a data lake involves several steps. First, the data must be gathered from multiple sources, including structured and unstructured sources such as log files, web traffic, sensor data and more. Next, the data must be cleansed and transformed into a common format, such as JSON or XML. Third, the data must be stored in a distributed system, such as a Hadoop cluster or a NoSQL database. Finally, this data must be accessible for users and applications, typically via an API or query language. Creating a data lake uses a variety of technologies and processes, but the end result is a powerful data repository that can accelerate the decision-making process.",
