  "instruction": "Take this math equation, and explain what it means in layman's terms.",
  "input": "2x + 3y = 4z",
  "output": "This equation states that two times the value of x plus three times the value of y is equal to four times the value of z. In other words, if you have two of one type of object, three of another, and four of a third, the equation means that the total number of objects is equal.",
