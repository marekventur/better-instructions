  "input": "",
  "output": "The US Constitution is often referred to as a living document because of its ability to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances and needs. The Constitution is composed of several articles and amendments that have been amended over the years to keep abreast of the changing context and needs of the American people. The Founding Fathers created the Constitution with great foresight, enabling it to adapt in order to reflect the collective values of the nation. In this way, the Constitution maintains its relevance and continues to serve as a beacon of freedom and justice.",
