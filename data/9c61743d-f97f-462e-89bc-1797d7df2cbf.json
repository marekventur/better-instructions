  "input": "",
  "output": "Linear growth is an increase in value that is consistent over time, where each additional unit of measure is the same as the last. For example, linear growth may occur at an incremental rate of 10 units per week. On the other hand, exponential growth is an increase in value that compounds over time. The rate of increase is not consistent, and it grows increasingly larger with each passing unit of measure. For example, exponential growth may occur at an increasing rate of 10, 12, 20, 40, 80, etc.",
