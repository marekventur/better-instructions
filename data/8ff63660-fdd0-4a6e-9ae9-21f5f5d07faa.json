  "output": "Restaurant delivery is a service that allows customers to order food online from restaurants for delivery. These services are available through apps or websites which allow customers to search for restaurants by cuisine, distance, ratings, and more. Customers can order food and pay for it through the app or website and the restaurant then delivers the food to the customer's door. Delivery times vary depending on the restaurant. Delivery fees are usually paid by customers, however, some services offer delivery without additional fees. Depending on the service and the restaurant, customers may also have the option to have the food delivered contactless. This means that the restaurant personnel leave the food outside the customer's door or at another designated place.",
