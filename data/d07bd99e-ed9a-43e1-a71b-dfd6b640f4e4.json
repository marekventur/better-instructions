  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce the time spent on social media is to set specific times of day to check social media and limit yourself to those periods. This can help reduce the temptation of being on social media constantly, and allow you to focus your energy and attention on other tasks. Additionally, turning off notifications for social media can also be beneficial as it reduces the pressure to constantly check for updates or new posts.",
