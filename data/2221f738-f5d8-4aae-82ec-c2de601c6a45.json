  "instruction": "Explain how the air pressure affects human behavior.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The atmospheric pressure on Earth affects the amount of oxygen that we can breathe in. When the air pressure is too low, it means that the amount of oxygen available decreases; this can make people feel drowsy, dizzy, or nauseous. On the other hand, when the air pressure is too high, it can make people more irritable, anxious, or even more prone to headaches. In general, changes in air pressure have been linked to emotional changes in humans; however, these effects are usually subtle and occur only in extreme cases.",
