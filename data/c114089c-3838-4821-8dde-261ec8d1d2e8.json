  "input": "",
  "output": "Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are both chronic medical conditions that involve high levels of glucose in the blood, but they each have different risk factors. Type 1 diabetes is usually caused by an autoimmune response, whereas type 2 diabetes is often linked to obesity, physical inactivity, and aging. Both involve a lack of insulin production or inefficient use of insulin in the body, but the most significant difference is that type 1 diabetes occurs in childhood and type 2 diabetes commonly develops in adulthood.",
