  "instruction": "Write a persuasive argument against the use of plastic straws",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Plastic straws have become a big environmental problem. They are made from non-biodegradable materials and can last up to 500 years in the environment. In the US alone, we use 500 million plastic straws per day, and this number is increasing each year. By using plastic straws, we are releasing toxic chemicals such as BPA into our environment, and the plastic straws are often mistaken for food by marine animals and birds, leading to their death. Furthermore, plastic straws are expensive and unsustainable. We can reduce the pollution caused by plastic straws by changing to reusable metal or glass straws or refusing to use straws altogether. By making small changes, we can make a big difference for our environment.",
