  "input": "",
  "output": "GPT-2 and GPT-3 are both state-of-the-art AI language models developed by OpenAI. GPT-2 is the predecessor to GPT-3 and was trained on 40 GB of text data from the web. GPT-3 is significantly larger than GPT-2, having been trained on a much larger dataset with 175 billion parameters. GPT-3 has a more sophisticated architecture and uses a combination of self-attention and Transformers to capture more complex relationships between text. GPT-3 has been shown to generate higher-quality text than GPT-2, making it preferable for many tasks such as text summarization and dialogue.",
