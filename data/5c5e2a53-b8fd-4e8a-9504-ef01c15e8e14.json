  "input": "",
  "output": "Love has no boundaries,\nIt can drive us through miles,\nIt can fill the heart full of hope,\nStill make the courage rise in miles.\n\nWe may feel lost and confused,\nBut then love will make us brave,\nIts guidance will show it's true,\nCompassion turns despair to a wave.\n\nWe all falter in our times,\nBut when love embraces us it will shine,\nWe can find our way back home,\nWhere love will help us to align.\n\nNo matter what life brings us,\nLove will make it worth,\nIt will make us feel alive,\nTo make a beautiful journey in the Earth.",
