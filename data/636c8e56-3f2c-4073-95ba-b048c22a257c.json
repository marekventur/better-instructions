  "instruction": "Propose a solution for dealing with air pollution.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An effective way to deal with air pollution is to implement renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal power. This would power industry and households while vastly reducing the amount of pollution created. Additionally, increased funding could be given to research and development to create more innovative and efficient forms of renewable energy. Legislation can also be introduced to place limits on the amount of air pollutants produced, as well as imposing fines and other penalties on companies that exceed those limits.",
