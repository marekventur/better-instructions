  "output": "The place I feel most at peace is in my garden. It is a beautiful oasis in the middle of the city, surrounded by lush plants, colorful flowers, and an array of bird songs. The tranquility and peace of the garden engulfs me and allows me to just be. I can sit here for hours, listening to Mother Nature's symphony and feeling soothed by the gentle breeze.",
