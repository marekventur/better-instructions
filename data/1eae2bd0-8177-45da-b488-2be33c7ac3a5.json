  "input": "",
  "output": "A disadvantage of using a deep learning network to perform object detection is that it requires a large amount of data to obtain good performance. Additionally, these models can be difficult to interpret, making it difficult to understand why a particular result was produced. Finally, deep learning networks are computationally expensive, requiring a lot of processing power to execute.",
