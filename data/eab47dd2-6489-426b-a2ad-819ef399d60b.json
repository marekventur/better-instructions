  "input": "",
  "output": "When the weather is cold, it is important to layer clothing to keep warm. A good base layer should be made from a natural fabric such as cotton or wool, which will help to wick away moisture. Over that, a middle layer of fleece or wool can be added for insulation, and a waterproof and windproof outer layer for protection from the elements. Additional clothing items to consider include hats, gloves, boots, and scarves.",
