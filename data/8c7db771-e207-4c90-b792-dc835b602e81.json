  "input": "",
  "output": "The decline of labor unions in the past few decades is due to a combination of factors, including a shift in workforce demographics, changes in labor laws, and the competition for skilled labor. Additionally, many large corporations have worked hard to make unions less popular, by providing incentives for workers to stay outside unions, promoting a union-free workplace and introducing alternative methods for employees to voice their concerns.",
