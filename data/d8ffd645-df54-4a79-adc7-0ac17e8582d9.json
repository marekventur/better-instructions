  "input": "",
  "output": "In the context of a marriage, separate property refers to property or assets that one spouse had prior to a marriage. This includes items that were acquired after the marriage or inherited from a family member, and does not automatically become the couple's shared property. On the other hand, joint property refers to property that is jointly owned by both spouses; it may include assets that are acquired by either spouse during the marriage. Joint property is to be divided equally in the event of a divorce.",
