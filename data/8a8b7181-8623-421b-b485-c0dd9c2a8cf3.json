  "output": "Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In mathematical terms, this is expressed as a2 + b2 = c2, where a and b are the lengths of the two sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse. This equation allows for the calculation of the length of the hypotenuse if the lengths of the other two sides are known. \n\nThe theorem can be used to solve a variety of problems when dealing with right triangles, and is especially useful for finding the length of a missing side in a right triangle. Additionally, it can be used to calculate other properties of a triangle such as the area and angle measures.",
