  "output": "One of the most common ethical issues related to data collection is the risk of data being used without people's knowledge or consent. Data can be obtained without consent through online tracking tools, cookies, online surveys, or other means. Data collected without permission can be used to make automated decisions, such as credit scoring or job applications, or manipulated to serve a certain agenda. Additionally, people's data can be leaked or sold without their knowledge, leading to potential security risks or financial harm. There is also the potential for discrimination or bias in data collection if companies obtain or use data in ways that are not fair or equitable. Finally, data collection can have adverse effects on an individual's privacy, as companies are able to collect and store large amounts of data about a person that may not be relevant to their needs or wants.",
