  "instruction": "Find the wavelength of a sound wave with a frequency of 4.0\u00d710^4.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The wavelength of a sound wave with a frequency of 4.0\u00d710^4 is 7.5 meters. This is calculated by using the formula wavelength (\u03bb) = speed of sound (v) divided by frequency (f): \u03bb = v/f. The speed of sound in air is 343 m/s, so the wavelength is 343 m/s divided by 4.0\u00d710^4 Hz, which is equal to 7.5 m.",
