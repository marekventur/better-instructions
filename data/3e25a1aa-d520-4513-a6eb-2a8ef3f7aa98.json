  "output": "The four stages of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. In prophase, the chromosomes condense and spindle fibers start to grow. Then, during metaphase, the chromosomes line up along the equatorial plate. In anaphase, the centromeres divide, the chromosomes move towards the poles, and sister chromatids become separate chromosomes. Then, in telophase, a nuclear membrane forms around the chromosomes, cytokinesis begins, and a new nucleus is formed.",
