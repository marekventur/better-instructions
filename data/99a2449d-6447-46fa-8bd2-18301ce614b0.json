  "input": "",
  "output": "Ocean pollution has devastating impacts on marine life, the economy, and humans. Marine life can be harmed through ingestion of plastic debris or by being tangled in lost nets and other discarded materials. This can occur at all levels of the marine food chain, drastically reducing the numbers of some species or in extreme cases, leading to their extinction. Pollution can also damage coral reefs, which provide homes for a wide variety of marine species and have significant economic benefits. Pollution can also adversely affect humans by spreading toxins into the air and water on which we depend for our health and livelihood.",
