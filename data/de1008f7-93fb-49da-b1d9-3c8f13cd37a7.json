  "input": "No input",
  "output": "To prepare for a beach vacation, first gather all the necessary items you'll need, like a bathing suit, beach towel, sunscreen, sandals, sunglasses, and a hat. Lay these items out so you can make sure you have everything. Once you\u2019ve double-checked to ensure you have what you need, start to pack. Put nice, folded clothes in the suitcase first, then the heavier items, like shoes and toiletries. Don\u2019t forget to include items like mosquito repellent, books, and a beach activity (such as a Frisbee). Finally, make sure to grab any essential documents like passports and tickets on your way out the door.",
