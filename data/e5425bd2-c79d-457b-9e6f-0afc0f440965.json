  "output": "An operating system (OS) is a set of computer programs that manage hardware and software resources and provide common services for computer programs. The operating system is the most important type of system software in a computer system. It operates the computer hardware and provides a platform for application software to run. The operating system performs basic tasks such as controlling and allocating memory, prioritizing system requests, controlling input and output devices, facilitating networking, and managing files. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware and manages multiple applications at once.",
