  "output": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water from the environment around us. Water evaporates from the surface of the Earth such as from the ocean, rivers, and lakes, and rises into the atmosphere. There, it forms clouds and returns to Earth as precipitation. Some of this precipitation is absorbed into the soil and returns to the atmosphere through evaporation. Some of it replenishes the surface water and some of it flows into the ground, becoming groundwater. The underground water moves through the ground, eventually returning to the atmosphere or to the oceans.",
