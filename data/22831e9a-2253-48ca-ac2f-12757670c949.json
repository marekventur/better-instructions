  "input": "",
  "output": "The evidence of climate change is undeniable. Every day, new reports and studies emerge which show the drastic effects of global warming on our planet. Changes in temperature and sea levels are already having an impact on our ecology, our resources, and the way we live. The future consequences of inaction may be even worse, as rising temperatures will cause crop failure and desertification, while sea levels may rise significantly and create extreme weather events. Human beings must take decisive action now to reduce their environmental impact and mitigate the effects of climate change, otherwise the future of our planet is at risk.",
