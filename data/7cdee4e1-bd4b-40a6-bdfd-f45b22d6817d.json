  "input": "",
  "output": "The statement \"Organic food is healthier than non-organic food\" is difficult to evaluate definitively because there is not enough scientific research to make a conclusive statement. While some studies have shown that organic food contains fewer levels of pesticides and other potentially harmful toxins, there is not enough evidence to draw a definitive conclusion as to whether organic food is more likely to be healthier than non-organic food.",
