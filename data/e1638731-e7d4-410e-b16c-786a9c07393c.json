  "output": "Once there was a mischievous little rabbit named Mr. Flopsy. He loved playing pranks and causing trouble in his backyard. One day, he decided to steal some carrots from Mrs. Pott's vegetable garden. Mr. Flopsy quickly hopped away with the carrots, but his scurrying caught the attention of Mrs. Pott's guard dog, Samson. Mr. Flopsy had to be extra crafty to outrun the mighty Samson and make it home unscathed. After much dodging and weaving, Mr. Flopsy returned to his humble burrow with the stolen carrots. Even though he was safe, he had an overwhelming feeling of guilt. He decided from that day on to never commit any mischief ever again.",
