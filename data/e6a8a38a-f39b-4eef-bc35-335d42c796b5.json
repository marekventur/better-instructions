  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary reasons why the stock market can crash are earnings disappointments, changes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate, international crises, and a negative market outlook. Earnings disappointments occur when companies report an earnings miss instead of meeting analysts\u2019 expectation. A change in the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate can lead to market volatility, as it can affect borrowing costs and impact the velocity of money circulating in the market. International crises can also impact the stock market, as investors become wary of making risky investments. Finally, a negative market outlook can put downward pressure on stocks, as investors become less willing to buy stocks and more willing to sell them.",
