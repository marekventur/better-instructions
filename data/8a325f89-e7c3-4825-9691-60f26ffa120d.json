  "input": "",
  "output": "The Syrian refugee crisis is a complex and ongoing situation and there is no single, permanent solution. A comprehensive long-term solution would involve a coordinated effort to end the civil war and ultimately, the rebuilding of Syria. This would require an American-led, international coalition to provide humanitarian aid, seek peace through diplomatic means, and provide reconstruction assistance. In addition, this solution may require the relocation of some Syrian refugees to other countries and access to resettlement programs.",
