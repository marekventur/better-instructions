  "output": "A user interface for an online banking website should be straightforward and user-friendly. \n\nThe homepage should contain an introduction to the website, as well as a succinct overview of the banking services available. Users should also have easy access to their account information and transactions. \n\nThe navigation bar should be clearly displayed, and the website should be organized into sections for different types of services for easy navigation. \n\nEach page should be visually appealing and easy to read, with colors that are easy on the eyes. Hints, reminders, and error messages should be clear and easy to understand. \n\nThe user interface should also allow for quick and secure transactions, with auto sign-in options and two-factor authentication to ensure that users\u2019 accounts are protected. \n\nAdditionally, the website should be compatible with multiple devices and browsers for maximum accessibility.",
