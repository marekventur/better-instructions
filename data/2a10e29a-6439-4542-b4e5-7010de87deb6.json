  "input": "",
  "output": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is a type of machine learning algorithm that consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information. They are designed to approximate the behavior of neurons in the human brain, allowing ANNs to learn from data. An artificial perceptron is a type of ANN that consists of a single layer of nodes, which accept input and then produce an output. The output is determined by the weights assigned to the inputs, and the perceptron can learn by adjusting these weights. This type of algorithm is primarily used for binary classification.",
