  "instruction": "Propose a strategy to reduce air pollution in a city.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A strategy to reduce air pollution in a city could include several steps. The city should seek to improve its public transportation system, making it easier for people to use instead of driving their own cars. This could include expanding and modernizing existing public transportation systems, increasing frequency of routes, or introducing new or upgraded forms of transportation. Additionally, the city could encourage people to limit car usage and look for alternative forms of transportation like biking or walking. The city could also incentivize driving electric or hybrid cars, or provide tax cuts to companies who invest in air pollution-reducing technologies.",
