  "input": "",
  "output": "Debates surrounding education are often heated, with a wide range of stakeholders offering varying viewpoints on important issues such as school funding, standardized testing, teacher qualifications, and curriculum. These debates have implications for how we fund our schools, how we assess student learning, how we evaluate the success of our schools, and how we prepare students for a global economy.  With so much at stake, education debates are unlikely to end anytime soon. It is important that we remain open-minded to the perspectives of others and consider the full range of available evidence. Only then can we make meaningful progress towards improving our educational system.",
