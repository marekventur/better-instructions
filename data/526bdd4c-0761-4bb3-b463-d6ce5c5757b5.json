  "output": "The rules for a game of tic-tac-toe are as follows: \n1. Two players take turns placing their mark (x or o) on the 3x3 board.\n2. The first player to make 3 marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game. \n3. If all squares are filled before either player gets 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw. \n4. If a player's mark is blocked three times preventing him/her from making three marks in a row, then the other player wins.",
