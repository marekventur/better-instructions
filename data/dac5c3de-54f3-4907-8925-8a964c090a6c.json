  "output": "Human-Centered Design (HCD) is a design approach which puts people at the center of the design process. The goal of HCD is to understand the user\u2019s context, needs and behaviors and create easy, convenient and pleasurable experiences. It requires a deep understanding of users' needs and a design team with a wide range of skills and diverse background. HCD starts with a research-driven process and uses the insights to create meaningful and user-centric products, services and experiences. The process strives to encourage user involvement in the design process and feedback to ensure that the product meets the users\u2019 needs.",
