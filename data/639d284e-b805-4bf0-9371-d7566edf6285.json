  "input": "",
  "output": "A black hole is an object in space whose gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from its interior. It is formed from the collapsed core of a massive star and is thought to be the densest object in the universe. A black hole typically has a mass many times greater than our Sun, and its mass can be determined by the amount of radiation it releases.",
