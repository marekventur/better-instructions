  "input": "Homeschooling",
  "output": "Homeschooling is a viable alternative to traditional schooling as it can provide students with increased autonomy, the ability to learn at their own rate and in an environment tailored to their learning style, and help children to build character and understand their unique talents. Without the distractions of a crowded classroom, students have more time to explore topics deeply and access greater variety of materials. Homeschooling also has the benefit of allowing students to grow closer to their families and gain important life skills like discipline and accountability.",
