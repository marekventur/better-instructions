  "input": "",
  "output": "Kruskal\u2019s algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm which is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a given graph. This algorithm works by adding edges to the graph one by one starting with the smallest edge, until all vertices are connected. This algorithm is important because it is used to solve problems such as finding the most efficient routes in networks, or finding the minimum distance between two points. In addition, this algorithm can be used for clustering data, finding approximations of the optimal solution of a problem and clustering in groups.",
