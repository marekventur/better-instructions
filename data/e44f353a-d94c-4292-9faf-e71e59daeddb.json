  "instruction": "Design an algorithm for recognizing handwriting",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm for recognizing handwriting should involve several stages. Firstly, the algorithm should preprocess the input image by applying an image transformation algorithm to reduce the amount of noise and extract prominent features. Secondly, the algorithm should use a feature extraction algorithm to identify unique attributes of the input image. Finally, a classification algorithm should be used to identify the characters in the input image. This algorithm should be able to recognize multiple different scripts, including Latin, Cyrillic and Chinese characters.",
