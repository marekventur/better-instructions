  "output": "In the last few months, working from home has become the norm for many employees around the world. On one hand, the option of having flexible hours and the likely decrease in distractions has been welcomed by some employees. On the other hand, there are issues with working from home that cannot be overlooked.\n\nOne main issue of working from home is the isolation it brings. Working with colleagues and bouncing ideas off each other is a part of any job, but with working from home, many employees feel detached and alone. This can lead to reduced productivity, as it can be hard to stay motivated and engaged when lonely.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of collaboration is definitely a con. Group projects and brainstorming sessions simply cannot take place in the same way when team members are physically seperated from one another. Moreover, communication over the internet can be hindered by technological issues or misunderstandings, which can lead to further delays and a lack of clarity for the work that needs to be done.\n\nIn conclusion, while working from home can provide certain benefits, it does not come without its drawbacks. Working from home should be encouraged where possible, but we should also recognize when it can worsen the work environment instead of improve it.",
