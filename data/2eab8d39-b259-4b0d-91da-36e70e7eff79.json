  "output": "Photosynthesis is a process by which plants convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy. During photosynthesis, plants absorb light energy from the sun, which is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars, releasing oxygen as a by-product. The energy produced is then stored in the form of glucose, for the plant to use for growth and reproduction.",
