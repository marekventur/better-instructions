  "output": "Alexa Ridgewood was used to the hustle and bustle of city life, but this was something different. She had dreamt of being a news reporter since she was a little girl and here she was, living her dream at the top of the news world. She was never one to back down from a story, no matter how dangerous it may be.\n\nHer days would often begin at 4 AM, with a hot cup of coffee in hand and the radio on full blast to the morning news. She'd quickly get ready, grab her bags and head out into the city. Her days were never the same, from chasing down the story of a lifetime to attending press conferences and interviews. She was able to get the scoop on the current happenings of the day and report it back to the news stations. \n\nNo matter how tough the story, she was always up for it and could be seen sprinting, camera in hand, all across the city in pursuit of the truth. Alexa Ridgewood was the reporter the city needed and she was more than happy to provide it.",
