  "input": "John is having trouble connecting to the internet with his wireless router.",
  "output": "The first step to troubleshooting a network connectivity issue is to check the connection settings on the router. Make sure that the wireless network is enabled and that it is set to the right password. If the settings are correct, then restart the router and try the connection again. Also, make sure that the wireless network is not blocked by antivirus or firewall software. Finally, if all else fails, try a different wireless network or reset the router.",
