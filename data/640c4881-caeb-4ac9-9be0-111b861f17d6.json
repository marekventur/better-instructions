  "input": "",
  "output": "The internal combustion engine is a type of heat engine that converts heat energy into mechanical energy. It operates by introducing a fuel, typically gasoline, diesel, or natural gas, and air into a combustion chamber, where it is ignited by a spark plug or other source of ignition. As the fuel burns, it stripes and pushes a piston, which rotates a crankshaft. This rotational motion is used to turn the wheels of the vehicle, thus propelling it forwards.",
