  "instruction": "I heard about medical scans being able to detect cancer. Can you explain how this works?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Yes. Medical scans can be used to detect cancer by detecting abnormal changes in tissues or organs. For example, CT scans or MRI scans can be used to detect abnormal lesions which may be indicative of cancerous growth. Additionally, positron emission tomography (PET) scans can be used to detect higher levels of metabolic activity in tissues that could be indicative of cancerous growth.",
