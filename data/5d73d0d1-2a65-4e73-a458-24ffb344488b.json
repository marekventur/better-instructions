  "input": "",
  "output": "Quantum computing is a field of study that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to build computers that can solve certain problems more efficiently than traditional computers. These computers use properties of quantum particles such as superposition and entanglement to process calculations that are not possible using classical computers. This enables the processing of large amounts of data in a much shorter amount of time, which could open the door to new possibilities in science and technology.",
