  "input": "No input",
  "output": "The F1 score is a standard measure of accuracy for classification problems. It is a combination of precision, which is the ability of a model to identify only relevant data points, and recall, which is the ability of a model to identify all relevant data points. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and gives a good indication of how effectively your model is performing in terms of accuracy.",
