  "input": "",
  "output": "The human digestive system is composed of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, and other organs, and is designed to break down food for energy and nutrition. Birds, on the other hand, have a simpler digestive system consisting of a crop, gizzard, and intestines. The crop stores food to be digested, the gizzard grinds it up, and then the food passes through the short intestines to extract nutrients.",
