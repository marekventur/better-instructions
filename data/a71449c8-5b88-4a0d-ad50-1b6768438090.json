  "input": "",
  "output": "The graphical user interface should include options for employees to view their current month\u2019s payroll and previous payrolls, as well as a detailed breakdown of all expenses. It should also include an option to view the company\u2019s contribution to benefits and deductions. The interface should provide an intuitive way to search and filter the data, allowing users to quickly find the desired information. Finally, the interface should be visually appealing and easy to use.",
