  "instruction": "Explain why democracy is more suitable for running a country than a dictatorship.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Democracy is a more suitable form of government for a country than dictatorship because it gives citizens the opportunity to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives and the lives of their communities. Democracy also allows for more creative, progressive, and innovative solutions to problems. Dictatorships, on the other hand, stifle progress and enable the abuse of power with little accountability from citizens. Additionally, democracy allows for an environment of greater personal freedoms and allows a wider range of opinions to be heard. Ultimately, democracy ensures that no individual is able to accumulate too much power unchecked, creating a more equitable society.",
