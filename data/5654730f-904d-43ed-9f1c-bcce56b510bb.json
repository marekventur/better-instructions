  "input": "",
  "output": "The three types of clouds are stratus, cumulus, and cirrus. Stratus clouds are flat, layered clouds that form at low altitudes and can cause light precipitation, cumulus clouds are dense, cottony clouds that develop vertically and form in mid-level altitudes, and cirrus clouds are high-altitude, wispy clouds that often indicate the presence of stable weather systems.",
