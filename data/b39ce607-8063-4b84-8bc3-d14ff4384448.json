  "output": "The entire family was in utter shock after a tragic accident killed their beloved patriarch. No one could believe that the warm, loving man who was the center of the family was gone. \n\nHowever, in the midst of their grief, the family could not ignore a spark of hope. They found that, if they put their energy and devotion into helping each other heal their broken hearts, then the pain would be swallowed up by the love they shared.\n\nThrough passionate nights of therapy, comforting embraces, and if they were lucky, a good laugh, they were all eventually able to come to terms with their great loss. What once caused only anguish started to evoke smiles and fond memories of their lost family member.\n\nThe tragedy had brought the family closer together, and from the ashes of their despair, rose a new hope.",
