  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural languages are those that have evolved naturally and are used for communication by a large group of people, such as English, French, and Spanish. Artificial languages, on the other hand, are languages that are created by humans, either for communication in specific settings or for specific purposes. Examples of artificial languages include computer programming languages and machine languages, designed to allow computers to communicate and perform tasks. Natural languages are spoken or written and allow for a greater range of communication, while artificial languages generally have a specific purpose such as coding or decoding. Artificial languages have a stricter structure of syntax and grammar rules, while natural languages are more flexible in their rules and forms of expression. Artificial languages are used to express ideas and exchange data, while natural languages are used to express beliefs and to share information among people. Finally, artificial languages can be designed and modified to serve different purposes while natural languages are shaped over time by cultures and societies.",
