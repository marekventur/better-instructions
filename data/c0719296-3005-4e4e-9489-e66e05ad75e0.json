  "input": "",
  "output": "Speciation occurs when a species splits into two distinct populations, which can happen when populations become geographically isolated from each other and develop different adaptations through the process of natural selection. Over time, these differences between the populations become so great that the two populations can no longer interbreed and are no longer considered one species.",
