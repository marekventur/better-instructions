  "instruction": "What are the implications of the following passage for public policy?",
  "input": "Recent research shows that over half of all households struggle to make ends meet. Many people cannot afford basic goods and services, such as food and housing.",
  "output": "The implications of this research for public policy are clear: increasing incomes for struggling households should be a priority for governments. This can be done through wage increases, tax breaks, or other measures that increase incomes. In addition, governments should work to make basic goods and services, such as housing and food, more affordable. This could include providing subsidies or tax breaks for essentials, or creating public programs that address the specific needs of low-income households.",
