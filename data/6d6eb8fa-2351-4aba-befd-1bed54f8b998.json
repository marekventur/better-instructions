  "input": "",
  "output": "The meme provides an ironic analysis of the self-defeating behavior that we all have at some point engaged in. It attempts to shed light on how people often act out of fear, insecurity, or stubbornness and how this prevents us from progressing in life. The main idea of the meme is that we all do things that stop us from achieving our goals, and this behavior can be self-sabotaging.",
