  "input": "Professor: Dr. George Brown\nSubject: Proposed research project",
  "output": "Dear Dr. Brown,\n\nI am writing to inquire about the possibility of carrying out a research project under your guidance. I am interested in researching the effects of nutrient availability on species diversity in coastal habitats. I am particularly interested in exploring the effects of nutrient availability on diatom communities.\n\nI have taken several courses on marine ecology and have some experience in laboratory research as part of a course project. I have also have carried out a literature review related to my project and am familiar with recent research findings in the area.\n\nI am confident that the proposed project will be valuable in helping to understand the biological dynamics of nutrient availability in coastal habitats. I am sure that your experience and guidance will be invaluable to me in completing the research project.\n\nI look forward to discussing this further with you.\n\nSincerely,",
