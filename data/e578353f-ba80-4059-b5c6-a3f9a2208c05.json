  "input": "",
  "output": "Matrices are an important tool in linear algebra because they can be used to represent and simplify linear equations. A matrix can represent a group of equations that has the same solution. It can also be used to calculate the inverse, determinant, and other properties of a system of equations and can be used to solve systems of equations. Matrices are also used in calculus for computing derivatives and integrals.",
