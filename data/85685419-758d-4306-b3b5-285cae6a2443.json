  "output": "The survey should include questions about age, gender, ethnicity, educational level, marital status, occupation, income level, and geographic location. These questions should be specific enough to collect the desired information, but not too invasive. The survey should also include a few open-ended questions so that respondents can provide more detailed information about their backgrounds.",
