  "instruction": "Describe the phenomenon of carbon dioxide absorption in the atmosphere.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants and sea creatures and is an important component of the carbon cycle in the atmosphere. Through photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide in order to convert it into food while ocean creatures do the same in order to produce energy. This process helps in balancing the greenhouse effect by preventing the over-accumulation of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide absorption also helps to maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, which helps in the regulation of Earth\u2019s climate.",
