  "input": "",
  "output": "Strengths of an online shop include convenience, cost savings, and the ability to access a wider selection of products. Consumers can shop from the comfort of their homes and can compare prices easily across a variety of websites. Additionally, online shops also have the advantage of allowing customers to buy products at any time of the day, which increases customer access to products. \n\nWeaknesses of an online shop include a lack of physical presence which makes it difficult to provide customers with tangible experiences, such as the ability to touch and feel products. Additionally, the lack of customer service associates means customers may have difficulty getting answers or assistance. Furthermore, the inability to immediately receive their purchases may put off some consumers. Lastly, customers may also be wary of the security of their financial information on the site.",
