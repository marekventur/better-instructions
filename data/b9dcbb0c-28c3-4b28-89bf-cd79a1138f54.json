  "instruction": "Give a brief answer to the following question.",
  "input": "What is the difference between a Ponzi scheme and a pyramid scheme?",
  "output": "The main difference between a Ponzi scheme and a pyramid scheme is in the way they operate. Ponzi schemes rely on a single entity or person to fool people out of their money, while pyramid schemes rely on participants recruiting new members to increase their earnings. In a Ponzi scheme, the fraudster will solicit funds from new investors and use the money to pay back earlier investors; in a pyramid scheme, members receive money from new participants recruited below them, resulting in a chain of recruitment.",
