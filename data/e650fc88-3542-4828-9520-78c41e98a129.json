  "output": "My school was a wonderful place - full of vibrant, curious students, and teachers who really cared about us. Every morning, my classmates and I would walk through the gates and instantly be enveloped in a sea of chatter, laughter and the occasional groan of exasperation from a student who was studying for a test. \nThe hallways were lined with artwork created by the talented students, and there were always fun activities and clubs to join. I was a part of the school's debating team, and speaking in front of other people quickly became my favorite pastime. After school, my friends and I could often be found gathered around a table in the cafeteria, sharing stories and ideas. \n\nMy school wasn't just a place to learn, it was a place that encouraged us to express ourselves, to ask questions and to be ourselves.",
