  "instruction": "Choose two animals which are typically not kept together in captivity and describe the environment needed to keep them both healthy and happy.",
  "input": "Lion and Penguin",
  "output": "To keep a lion and penguin healthy and happy, they should be kept in separate enclosures, with the lion's enclosure containing plenty of tall grasses and trees for hiding, environmental enrichment, and exercise. The penguin's enclosure should be well-insulated due to their need for cold temperatures. It should also contain an adequate swimming pool for them to dive and play in, as well as plenty of rocks and other objects for them to forage for food. Additionally, the space should be large enough for them to move around and explore, as both animals require plenty of stimulation.",
