  "input": "",
  "output": "I was on a bus ride between cities when I noticed a stranger sitting next to me. We were both just minding our own business, but after a few moments, he started asking me questions about my life. We ended up having a fascinating conversation and he told me some funny stories that made me laugh. He shared his thoughts on life, spirituality and philosophy and by the end of the 45-minute journey, I felt like I had made a new friend. When we got to my stop, I thanked him for sharing his insights and wished him well for his onward journey.",
