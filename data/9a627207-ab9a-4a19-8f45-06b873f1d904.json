  "input": "",
  "output": "The hottest planet in our Solar System is Venus. With an average surface temperature of 867\u00b0F (464\u00b0C), it is much hotter than Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun. Venus also has a thick atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide, which traps much of the Sun\u2019s heat and further contributes to its high temperature.",
