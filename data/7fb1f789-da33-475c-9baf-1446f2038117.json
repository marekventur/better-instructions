  "input": "Fire requires oxygen.",
  "output": "The scientific theory that applies to this statement is the Law of Conservation of Mass, which states that matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed. In this case, when oxygen combines with a combustible material, such as wood, the chemical reaction creates heat and light, which is fire. The oxygen, heat, and light cannot be created or destroyed, only rearranged.",
