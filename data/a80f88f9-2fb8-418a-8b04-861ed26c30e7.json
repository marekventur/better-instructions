  "instruction": "Design a system to classify objects based on its size (small, medium and large)",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The system can be designed to classify objects based on its size by using image recognition techniques. The system should be able to identify the size of the object by comparing it to reference measurements. The reference measurements should include the width, height, and depth of objects across a range of sizes. Depending on the size of the object, it should be assigned a category as small, medium, or large. These categories can be further broken down into more sub-categories if needed. The system should also consider any objects that cannot be classified accurately due to their irregular shape or size.",
