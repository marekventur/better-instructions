  "input": "",
  "output": "Daisy Buchanan, in The Great Gatsby, symbolizes the American Dream. As a beautiful and wealthy woman, she captures the attention of many men, even though she is already married. She is looking for someone to provide her with the perfect life that she cannot find in her current state. She is tempted by the charm and wealth of Jay Gatsby, and her attraction for him makes her question her own values. She represents the emptiness of the upper-class life, and ultimately chooses wealth over love, which reveals her selfishness.",
