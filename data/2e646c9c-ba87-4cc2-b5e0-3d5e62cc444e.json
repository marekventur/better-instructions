  "output": "One feature that a smartphone could have to make it easier to take care of the environment is a trackable energy use monitor. This would allow users to track the amount of energy their device uses, which would enable them to adjust usage to reduce their individual carbon footprints. Additionally, this monitor could be used to alert users to potentially harmful environmental conditions around them, such as pollutants or radiation levels.",
