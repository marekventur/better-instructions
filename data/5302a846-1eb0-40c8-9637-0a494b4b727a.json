  "input": "",
  "output": "Computer science and software engineering are distinct fields, but they are highly related. Computer science is focused on the theoretical and mathematical foundations of computing, while software engineering is focused on the practical application of these principles, specifically in the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. Computer science deals more with theory, algorithms, data structures, and programming languages, while software engineering focuses more on software design, development, quality assurance, and project management.",
