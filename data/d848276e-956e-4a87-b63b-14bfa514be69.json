  "input": "How can people recycle more effectively?",
  "output": "One way people can recycle more effectively is to learn how to properly sort their waste. By segregating materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal into separate containers, people can ensure that their waste is properly recycled. Additionally, people can look into alternative methods of recycling, such as composting food scraps or finding creative uses for plastic containers. Finally, people should try to buy products with minimal packaging and opt for reusable items whenever possible.",
