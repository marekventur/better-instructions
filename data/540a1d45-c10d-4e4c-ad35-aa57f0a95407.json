  "input": "",
  "output": "GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a natural language processing model used to generate responses. It is trained on a lot of text data, so it can understand the context and generate meaningful responses. To use GPT information to generate a response, you must provide the GPT system with the relevant input while also specifying the length of the generated output. The system will then use the given inputs to generate an appropriate response in the desired length.",
