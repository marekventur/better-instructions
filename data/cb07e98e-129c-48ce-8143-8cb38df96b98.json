  "input": "",
  "output": "In computer science, Big-O notation is used to describe the performance of an algorithm\u2014 specifically the worst case number of operations required to execute the algorithm. Big-O notation assigns a letter \"O\" to a function that describes the growth rate of its execution time. The number of operations is then classified according to how quickly it grows in terms of the input size. Big-O notation is often used to compare different algorithms to see which one is faster.",
