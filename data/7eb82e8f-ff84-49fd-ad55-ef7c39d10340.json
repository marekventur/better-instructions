  "output": "Two ways to save money on groceries include buying in bulk when possible and taking advantage of coupons, discounts, and sales. Bulk buying is a great option for non-perishable items like rice, beans, chickpeas, and nuts, which all store well. Coupons, discounts, and sales can be found both in stores and online, and can often be used to get discounts on popular items and brands. Additionally, making meals from scratch and planning ahead to use leftovers will also help to save money.",
