  "output": "Projectile motion is a type of motion in which an object is thrown at an angle and moves in a curved path under the influence of gravity. It is a special type of two-dimensional motion in which the object experiences constant acceleration due to the force of gravity. The path of the projectile is parabolic in nature, with the object forming the highest point of its trajectory called the apex. The parabolic path is known as a trajectory, and the maximum height reached by the projectile is called the maximum height. As the object falls, its speed decreases and it eventually lands on the ground.",
