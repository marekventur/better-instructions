  "input": "",
  "output": "One disadvantage of solar energy is that it is not available at night, and energy storage is expensive. Additionally, solar energy is vulnerable to cloud cover, so its reliability can vary depending on the location and weather. Solar energy systems are also relatively expensive compared to other forms of power production.",
