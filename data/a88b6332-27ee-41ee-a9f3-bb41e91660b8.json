  "output": "I\u2019d love to live in an apartment situated in a nice and quiet neighborhood. The apartment itself should be spacious, bright and airy with plenty of windows for natural lighting. The kitchen should have all the modern appliances, the bathrooms should be updated, and the living area should be inviting and comfortable. I would also like a dishwasher, a walk-in closet, a balcony and hardwood flooring - all of which add to the charm of a modern apartment.",
