  "output": "Once there was a student named Joe who lived in a small town. Joe was an intelligent and hardworking student but he often got caught up in the mundane of school and day-to-day life. He was accustomed to following instructions and routines without question. One day, his teacher asked the class to think outside of the box and come up with a project that could potentially innovate the community. Joe took it upon himself to use his skills to create an app that could help his community stay informed of current events. He invested a lot of time and effort in his project and eventually achieved success. Joe ultimately learnt that being proactive and thinking outside of the box can help realise a dream and benefit the community at large.",
