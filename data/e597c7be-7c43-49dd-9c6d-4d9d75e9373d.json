  "input": "\"<noinput>\"",
  "output": "Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydropower can help reduce environmental pollution as they do not produce the same toxic substances as traditional sources of energy, such as fossil fuels. These renewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gases, which are the main contributors to global warming and climate change. By substituting traditional sources of energy with renewable sources, we can reduce air pollution and its associated health problems, such as asthma and lung disease. Additionally, renewable energy sources have the potential to reduce water pollution as they typically rely on more efficient, non-industrial and non-chemical forms of production.",
