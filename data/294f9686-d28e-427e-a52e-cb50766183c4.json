  "input": "",
  "output": "A neutron star is a compact stellar remnant formed when the outer layers of a massive star are ejected during a supernova, leaving behind an incredibly dense core composed of neutrons. Neutron stars are incredibly small, with a radius of only a few kilometers, yet they can have masses as large as the sun. This means neutron stars have an incredibly high density. Neutron stars also rotate rapidly, with some rotating hundreds of times a second.",
