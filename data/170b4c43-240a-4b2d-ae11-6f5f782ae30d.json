  "output": "The use of metaphors in \"The Catcher in the Rye\" by J.D. Salinger and \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald differ greatly. In \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" metaphors serve as a way for Holden Caulfield to better express his ideas, as well as his thoughts on humanity. He often uses metaphors to draw comparisons between his life and others' - for instance, he compares himself to a \"catcher in the rye\" who is guarding children from falling off a cliff. In \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, metaphors are used to create a mystical atmosphere around Gatsby and to emphasize his ideas of unattainable dreams and the unattainable love between him and Daisy. Gatsby is repeatedly described as a \"mythical figure,\" conveying his larger-than-life persona, which is later revealed to be a facade. Additionally, the green light at the end of Daisy's dock serves to represent the unattainable dream of love Gatsby is pursuing.",
