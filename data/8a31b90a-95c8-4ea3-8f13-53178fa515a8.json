  "output": "Good evening everyone! I'm your host for the night, and I'd like to thank you all for coming. \n\nNow, I've been told I need to make the next three minutes real funny so let's see what I can do. \n\nHave you ever noticed how much easier it is for us to be kind to people we don't really know? I saw a great example of this the other day when I was at a coffee shop. The barista got my order wrong but the person waiting in line next to me said \"Oh, that's ok; we all make mistakes.\" \n\nIt's a good reminder that we don't have to be so hard on ourselves and on each other. Because while it's easy to be kind to strangers, it can be much harder to be kind to ourselves and the people we care about. \n\nBut it's worth it! Because if we can show each other a little bit of compassion and understanding, it can make all the difference. \n\nAnyway, enough of that \u2014 let's lighten the mood a little. So what did the chicken say when he saw a bee? He said: \"Buzz buzz, it looks like my lunch is here!\" \n\nThanks for listening!",
