  "output": "A feature that could be implemented in a hypothetical online shopping app is a personalized shopping list. This feature would allow users the ability to create and store shopping lists tailored to their specific needs and preferences. It would allow them to browse a variety of items and save the items they would like to purchase in the future. The lists could be organized according to categories, like food, home decor, etc., and can be shared with other members of their household. The lists could be managed through a web interface as well as a mobile app.",
