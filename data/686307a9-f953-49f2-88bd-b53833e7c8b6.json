  "output": "Once there was a koala who was afraid of heights, but had always dreamed of flying like a bird. So she decided to take the chance and built a contraption that would allow her to soar through the sky with the help of a homemade propeller. Every day she would bravely test out her device, each time tweaking it a bit more until she could finally fly as high as the birds.",
