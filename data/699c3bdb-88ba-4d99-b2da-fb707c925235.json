  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural language processing is currently used in a variety of applications, including virtual assistants and chatbots, text-based search, automatic summarization and translation, and language generation. Virtual assistants and chatbots use NLP to interpret user input and create natural, conversational responses. Text-based search utilizes NLP to interpret user queries and return relevant results. Automatic summarization and translation applications use NLP to generate summaries or translations of text. Finally, language generation couples NLP with machine learning to create natural-sounding phrases that can be used to generate text or dialogue.",
