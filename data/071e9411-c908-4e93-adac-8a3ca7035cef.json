  "output": "Here I stand\nSo overwhelmed by sadness\nThat I don't understand\nThe anguish and pain that I confess\n\nMy swollen eyes, hidden fear\nThe sorrow in my heart\nHave left me here\nWith a very heavy start.\n\nMy tears that fall\nAre like a deep waterfall\nThey can't be contained \nJust like sorrow from days past remains\n\nThe pains that I feel\nFar too real\nMy longing tears\nFall endlessly throughout the years\n\nBut even in this darkness, I fight\nSearch for the courage I need to take flight.",
