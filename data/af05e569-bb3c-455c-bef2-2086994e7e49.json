  "instruction": "Describe a creative way to use wearables as part of a marketing campaign.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A creative use of wearables for marketing could involve using the device to facilitate customer engagement. For example, businesses could create audio promotions and give out the devices to customers with instructions to listen to the audio promotion when they wear the devices. These audio promotions could include deals and discounts, surveys, or even audio ads. The businesses can track customer engagement with the devices and use analytics to understand customer preferences and respond accordingly. Wearables can also be used for gamification to increase customer loyalty and engagement. This could be done by offering customers rewards for completing challenges related to using their wearables, such as tracking their steps or doing exercises using the device.",
