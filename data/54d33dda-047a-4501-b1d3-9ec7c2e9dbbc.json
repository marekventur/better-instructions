  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the best ways to reduce water wastage is to use water-efficient appliances and fixtures. This includes using low-flow showerheads, faucets, toilets, and dishwashers; installing rain barrels to collect rainwater; and taking shorter showers. Other methods to reduce water wastage include fixing any leaks as quickly as possible, running only full loads of laundry, and only running the dishwasher when necessary. Additionally, conserving water when watering plants and lawns can help reduce water wastage significantly.",
