  "output": "Dogs and cats are both popular companion animals, but they differ in many ways. Dogs are especially known for their loyalty, obedience, and intelligence, while cats are known for their independence and aloofness. Dogs typically require more active engagement from their owners, while cats are quite capable of entertaining themselves. Dogs tend to form strong social bonds with their owners and enjoy being part of the family, while cats prefer to maintain more of their solitary nature.",
