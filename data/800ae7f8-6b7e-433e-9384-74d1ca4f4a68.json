  "input": "",
  "output": "A computer virus is a malicious software program designed to replicate itself and spread to other computers. The most common type of virus is the Trojan Horse virus, which masquerades as a legitimate program and once installed, causes damage by deleting files and corrupting data. Computer viruses can be transmitted via email attachments, external storage devices, and malicious websites. When a virus is activated, it is capable of replicating itself and may spread via peer-to-peer connections and other networks, making it difficult to stop the infection before it causes serious damage.",
