  "instruction": "Compare two things and evaluate which one is better.",
  "input": "Compare online learning and traditional classroom learning.",
  "output": "The advantages of online learning are its accessibility, flexibility, and cost. It allows students to learn in their own time and space, and at their own pace. Traditional classroom learning offers more face-to-face interaction and the ability to ask questions directly to the teacher. A hybrid approach that combines both online and traditional classroom learning could also be beneficial. Ultimately, which one is better depends on the student's learning style and personal preferences.",
