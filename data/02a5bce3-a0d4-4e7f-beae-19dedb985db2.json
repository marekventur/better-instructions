  "input": "",
  "output": "Some of the challenges associated with distributed data storage include data consistency, data integrity, data availability, data security, network latency, and system complexity. Data consistency is a challenge in distributed data storage because it requires all nodes in the distributed system to have access to the same data. Data integrity is a challenge because it requires the data to remain accurate and secure even when accessed by multiple users. Data availability is a challenge because it requires that the data is always accessible and reliable. Data security is a challenge because it requires protecting the data from unauthorized access, malicious actors, and other threats. Network latency is a challenge because it affects the speed of accessing data from distributed locations. Finally, system complexity is a challenge because it is difficult to scale and maintain a distributed architecture.",
