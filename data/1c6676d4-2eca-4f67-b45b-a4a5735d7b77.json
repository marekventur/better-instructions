  "input": "The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost",
  "output": "In this poem, Robert Frost reflects on the decision-making process of an individual at a crossroads. He expresses the difficulty of choosing which road to take, and how the decision may ultimately shape one\u2019s life. Though he wishes he could take both paths, Frost realizes that life does not offer such luxuries and he must choose one path and accept the consequences of his decision. Ultimately, Frost reminds us that the choices we make may very well lead to unexpected and rewarding destinations.",
