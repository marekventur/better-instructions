  "output": "Environmental context plays an important role in the development of a person as it provides an influence that shapes the behaviors of an individual. It is the social, cultural, and physical environment that can impact a person's thinking, decision-making, behavior, and the eventual outcome. The environment provides the opportunities of social interaction with people in a particular place, the resources and materials necessary for the development of the person. It can act as a source of safety, security and stability, and can help to shape different aspects of an individual's development. The environment can provide both support and challenges, and it is ultimately how an individual responds to the environment that is the key factor in determining his or her development.",
