  "output": "Feng shui is an ancient Chinese system of geomancy that seeks to promote harmony, happiness, and well-being by balancing the energies around us. It manipulates the environment in order to create an optimal space. The main principles of Feng Shui include the five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, water), the three areas of life (wealth, health, and relationships), the yin and yang, the Bagua (or life map), and the cardinal directions. In modern life, Feng Shui is typically used to create a more peaceful and balanced atmosphere in spaces. It can also be applied to the arrangement of furniture, the use of colours and shapes, and the placement of objects in order to increase fortune and bring good luck.",
