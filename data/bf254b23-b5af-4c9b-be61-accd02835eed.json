  "output": "Verse 1:\nI scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream,\nCos it's so delicious and it's the tastiest treat,\nIt's the king of desserts, best when a summer's heat,\nFrom chocolate to vanilla, there's no wrong way to eat.\n\nChorus:\nI scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream,\nNobody can resist it, it's so divine,\nEating ice cream, having some fun, we love it all summer long.\n\nVerse 2:\nOne scoop or two, it doesn't matter what you do,\nGrab a cone, grab a cup, there's room for everyone,\nFruity, nutty, creamy, or crunchy, it's all as yummy as can be,\nA sundae, a float, even a milkshake, it's the way to celebrate!\n\nChorus:\nI scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream,\nNobody can resist it, it's so divine,\nEating ice cream, having some fun, we love it all summer long.\n\nVerse 3:\nFrom soft serve to hard, it's the ultimate reward,\nA pick me up snack and nobody will complain,\nFresh flavors to last, it's the perfect snack for the summer reign,\nSo cool down with ice cream and enjoy the summer's game.\n\nChorus:\nI scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream,\nNobody can resist it, it's so divine,\nEating ice cream, having some fun, we love it all summer long.",
