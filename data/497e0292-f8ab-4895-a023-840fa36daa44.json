  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the different programming paradigms.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The three main programming paradigms are procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Procedural programming is focused on implementing a series of steps in order to carry out a task. Object-oriented programming is concerned with the creation of objects that have state and behavior. Functional programming, however, is based on treating functions as first-class citizens and looking for ways to simplify problems by breaking them down into smaller parts. The main difference between these three paradigms is the way code is structured and how the problem-solving approach is defined.",
