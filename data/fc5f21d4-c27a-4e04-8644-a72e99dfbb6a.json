  "input": "",
  "output": "The Berlin Wall deeply impacted German culture by drastically changing people's lives and reducing their freedom. During the Cold War, the Wall created two distinct sides of Germany, west and east. People were literally cut off from friends, family, and other communities on the other side. This led to many people's lives being disrupted due to the separation, leaving them feeling isolated and alone. The Wall also had a political and psychological impact, as it served as a physical manifestation of the political boundaries between east and west. It impacted how people identified themselves and created an artificial divide between the two sides of Germany. Ultimately the Wall left a lasting impact on the culture of Germany and its people.",
