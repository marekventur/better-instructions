  "output": "Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a system. It is measured in Kelvins (K) and is related to the speed of particles and how much energy they possess. Temperature increases as the particles move faster and gain more energy. Heat is the transfer of energy between two objects with a difference in temperature.",
