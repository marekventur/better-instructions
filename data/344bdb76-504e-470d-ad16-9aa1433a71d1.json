  "input": "",
  "output": "Democracy is a good form of government because it gives its citizens the power to select their leaders, rather than leaving it to a small ruling elite. This ensures that every voice is heard and every person has a say in how their country is run. Democracy also allows for fair elections and peaceful transitions of power, ensuring that leaders are accountable to their people. Finally, democracy provides stability and protection from arbitrary actions by those in power, which can be seen as a guarantee of fundamental rights for citizens.",
