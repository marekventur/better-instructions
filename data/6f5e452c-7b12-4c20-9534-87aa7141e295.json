  "input": "",
  "output": "The statement \"the world would be a better place if technology didn't exist\" is a contentious one. On one hand, technology has enabled human advancement in many ways, such as in the areas of communication, travel, and medicine. On the other hand, technology has also taken a toll on the environment and has caused collective disconnection between humans in comparison to a time before technology was so heavily integrated into everyday life. Ultimately, advanced technology can both improve and worsen the lives of individuals, and the effects of technology can be either positive or negative depending on how it is used.",
