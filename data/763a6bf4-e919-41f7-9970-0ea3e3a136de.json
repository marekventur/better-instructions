  "output": "The characters in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass have similar quirks, yet their motivations, relationships with each other, and experiences of Wonderland are wildly different. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Alice is often portrayed as a victim of her own curiosity, testing the boundaries of the world she finds herself in. Through the Looking-Glass takes a different approach, showing Alice more as an explorer, utilizing her creativity to solve puzzles and win battles. \n\nThe other characters are also in stark contrast to each other. The Queen of Hearts in Wonderland is a raging tyrant, while the Red Queen in Looking-Glass is haughty, but ultimately self-interested. Similarly, the Cheshire Cat in Wonderland is a mischievous trickster, while the Gryphon in Looking-Glass is wise and insightful. In both stories, however, Alice's allies remain the same--the White Rabbit and the Caterpillar in both Wonderland and Looking-Glass--illustrating Alice's steadfast loyalty in both tales.",
