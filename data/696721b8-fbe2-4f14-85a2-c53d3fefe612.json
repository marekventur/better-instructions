  "output": "Technology has revolutionized communication by radically shifting the way people communicate with one another. Technology has allowed for faster transmission of information, allowing people to communicate in real time from long distances. Communication technologies such as smartphones, computers, and the internet allow people to communicate from almost anywhere. Additionally, services such as video conferencing and social media allow people to build relationships with those they may not otherwise be able to interact with. These services have even allowed businesses to increase their reach and offer services to customers around the world. Technology continues to revolutionize communication and will continue to do so in the future.",
