  "input": "",
  "output": "The habitat of the Sumatran tiger is mainly the tropical and dry forests on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. They prefer the lowland forest regions and avoid mountainous areas. Sumatran tigers prefer to stay in the thick, undisturbed and complex forest habitats. These forests are important for their prey and provide the concealment necessary for their ambush hunting strategy. Their main prey consists of wild boar, deer, wild cattle and small mammals.",
