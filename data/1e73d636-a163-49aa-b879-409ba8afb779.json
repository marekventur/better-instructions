  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a man who was so devoted to the beauty of the night sky that he decided to build a car that could take him to the moon. He built and painted the car himself and decorated it with tiny stars so that it looked like a shining star in the night sky. One evening, he filled the car with a delicious sandwich that he had made and embarked on his journey. As he drove further and further up, the car became brighter and brighter with stars until he finally arrived at the moon. He enjoyed his sandwich and basked in the beauty of the star-dusted night sky until it was time for him to go back home.",
