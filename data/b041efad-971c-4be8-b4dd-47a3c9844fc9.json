  "input": "",
  "output": "The major difference between Apple HomePod and Google Home is the software that powers the devices. Apple HomePod is powered by the Siri voice assistant, while Google Home is powered by the Google Assistant. Siri is more hands-free than Google Home, as users can activate it using just their voice. In contrast, Google Home requires a physical action, such as pressing a button, to activate the voice assistant. Additionally, HomePod has better sound quality than Google Home due to its larger speaker.",
