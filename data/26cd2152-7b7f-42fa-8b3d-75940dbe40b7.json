  "input": "",
  "output": "A computer can help a person save time by automating mundane tasks that would otherwise consume a lot of time. This can include tasks such as managing emails, scheduling appointments and reminders, transferring files, organizing data, sorting through large amounts of data, and researching. Computers can quickly complete tasks that would normally take much longer for a human to complete, which in turn saves time and money.",
