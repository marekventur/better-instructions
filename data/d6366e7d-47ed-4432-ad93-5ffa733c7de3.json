  "output": "The golden leaves whirl in the autumn breeze,\nAs they flutter away from the dormant trees.\nThey journey through the aged forest so wild,\nDancing together, no more than a child.\nThe beauty of this season can never be denied,\nThe sun sets against the autumn sky.\nThe blanket of gold that covers the ground,\nMakes the trees' silence all the more profound.\nThanks to the wind and its gentle caress,\nThe forest awakes to the autumn's lovely dress.",
