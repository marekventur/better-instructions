  "instruction": "Compare the Earth's atmosphere with that of Mars.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gas such as argon and carbon dioxide; it is 100% nitrogen on Mars. The Earth also has significant water vapor (up to 4% by volume); Mars has no liquid water and only a trace amount of water vapor. The Earth's atmosphere is around 100 times thicker than that of Mars, with much higher atmospheric pressure. Earth's atmosphere also offers protection from ultraviolet radiation and meteoritic impacts, while the atmosphere of Mars is too thin to provide any protection.",
