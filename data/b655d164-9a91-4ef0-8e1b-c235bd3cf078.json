  "input": "A lonely heart with an empty dream\nTrapped in a place that isn't what it seems",
  "output": "Still I search for joy and peace of mind\nLest I'm left in darkness all the time\nThe future calls for a courageous heart\nTo shine light through the dangers of dark\nGive me the strength to keep going on\nAnd create a future that is bright and strong\nFor a new day is what I seek,\nAn end to sorrows, a start to a dream.",
