  "output": "When Mary arrived at the beach, the waves were calling her name. She knew it was going to be a great day when she put on her favorite swimsuit and took out her snacks and beach umbrella. All around her, she could hear the sound of the waves gently crashing against the shoreline. Her gaze was met by glimmering shells that had washed up on the sand, each calling out to her to take them home. Mary could already tell it was going to be the perfect day at the beach.",
