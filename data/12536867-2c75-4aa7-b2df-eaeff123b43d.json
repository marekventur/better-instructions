  "output": "The 4th Fibonacci number is 3. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers before it (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). To calculate the 4th Fibonacci number, you add the third and second numbers together, which would give you 3 (1 + 2).",
