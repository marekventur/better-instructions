  "output": "Two sides of a story all the same\nBut so swift and diametrically opposed\nOne looking to the future, making fame\nThe other rooted in the dark, close\n\nOne grows in hope and finds the light\nThe other entrenched in shadows of woe\nOne dreams of grand spectacles in sight\nThe other stunted as life slows\n\nOne rides the crest, it's trials and glee\nThe other battles down it's troubled waters\nOne paths with glorious gems to see\nThe other a rocky ruin of tattered walks\n\nBoth paths so unlike yet intertwined \nChasing the same destination of shore\nDreams divided yet inherently entwined\nPulled by the same source evermore.",
