  "output": "The process of making wine typically begins with the selection and crushing of grapes. The crushed grapes are then fermented, during which time the sugars in the grapes are converted to alcohol. The liquid is then transferred to casks or tanks, where it may be aged for several months or years. During this time, flavorings and colorings may be added to further refine the taste and visual appeal of the wine. Finally, the wine is bottled and sealed, ready to be enjoyed.",
