  "input": "As technology advances, mankind's ability to explore and reach locations previously inaccessible is rapidly increasing. With tech companies rushing to develop ever-more groundbreaking methods of transportation, the world is on the brink of a revolution in human travel.\n\nYet, one significant challenge stands in the way of planet-wide mobility- the sheer cost of transportation. Airline tickets, electric cars, and other methods of transport cost more than many of us can financially afford. Furthermore, such prices are often out of reach for people living in rural areas, where the infrastructure is not available.",
  "output": "As technology continues to develop, humankind is gaining access to places once thought to be inaccessbile. However, the costs of transportation remain too high for many to afford, creating a particularly sizable barrier for those located in rural areas with limited infrastructure. Companies are currently competing to find revolutionary methods of travel that can make these previously unreachable destinations more easily accessible.",
