  "output": "Three examples of how machine learning can be applied include automated image recognition, natural language processing, and automated fraud detection. Automated image recognition uses algorithms to detect objects in images. Natural language processing allows machines to understand natural language, and automated fraud detection uses algorithms to detect potential fraudulent activity.",
