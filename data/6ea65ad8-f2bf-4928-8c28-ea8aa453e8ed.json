  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to save energy in an office is to turn off or unplug electronic equipment when it is not in use. This includes computers, printers, and photocopiers. Unplugging equipment can also help reduce energy costs by helping to prevent any power surges or damaging spikes in electricity. Additionally, offices can replace any old and inefficient light bulbs with energy-efficient LED or CFL bulbs. This may also require replacing any light dimmers or switches with energy-efficient ones. Lastly, offices should ensure HVAC systems are set to a comfortable level that is not too hot or cold.",
