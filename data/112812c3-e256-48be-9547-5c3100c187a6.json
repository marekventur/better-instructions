  "output": "A powerful storm was rolling in, darkening the sky with thunderclouds. Bolts of lightning illuminated the sky with an eerie, white light. The wind howled past, howling and whistling deafeningly. The rain came down in sheets, coating the streets in water and washing away the roads. The storm created a sense of dread and worry amongst the people, as the power of nature was unleashed before their very eyes.",
