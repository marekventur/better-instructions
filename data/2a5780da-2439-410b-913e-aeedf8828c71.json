  "output": "As individuals, it can be difficult to know where to start when it comes to preserving the environment. However, small changes can make a big difference in reducing our collective environmental impact. Some simple steps to take include reducing our energy footprint where possible - opting for renewable energy sources, joining an environmentally conscious car-sharing club, using public transport or investing in an electric vehicle. We can also become more conscious of our waste, by recycling, upcycling and composting whenever possible, as well as minimizing our use of plastic and other single-use materials. Beyond that, it is important to spread the message, actively protest and support the cause and vote for environmentally aware candidates in any elections. #EnvironmentalImpact #Conservation #Sustainability",
