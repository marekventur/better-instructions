  "input": "The increase in global temperature",
  "output": "1. Increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to an excess of energy trapping. \n2. Volcanic activity causing increased emissions of greenhouse gases. \n3. Deforestation leading to decreased oxygen levels and higher carbon dioxide levels.\n4. Increased ocean temperature due to melting polar glaciers.\n5. Diminishing albedo effect due to ice loss in the Arctic.",
