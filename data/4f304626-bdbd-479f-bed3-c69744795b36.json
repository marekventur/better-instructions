  "output": "Once upon a time there were two good friends, Jimmy and Sarah. They were always helping each other, no matter how tough the situation was. No matter how much they argued, they were always sided by each other when it was needed.\n\nOne day, Jimmy got an invitation to study abroad, and Sarah felt very upset about it. She was afraid that if her best friend would go away, then she'll be left alone. Despite her emotions, Sarah gave Jimmy her blessings and wished him a safe journey.\n\nJimmy stayed in touch and kept writing to Sarah about his adventures. Sarah kept waiting for the day she'll meet her friend again.\n\nThe wait was finally over when Jimmy was able to come home and Sarah was the first one waiting for him at the airport to give him a big hug.\n\nIt was this unending bond of friendship that kept them connected and nothing could break it.",
