  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is that AI is an umbrella term for a range of technologies employing computer algorithms to automate tasks mimicking human intelligence, while ML is a type of AI that uses input data to create algorithms that can \u2018learn\u2019 and improve without being programmed to do so. AI focuses on the development of computer systems that are able to problem-solve and use techniques such as rule-based systems and natural language processing. ML uses statistical techniques and predictive data models to learn the behavior of given data and make predictions. AI focuses on problem-solving while ML focuses on data analysis and pattern recognition.",
