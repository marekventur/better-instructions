  "input": "",
  "output": "You can use a studying playbook to keep your notes organized and creative. The idea is to create a central notebook for studying that includes brainstorm drawings, flowcharts, diagrams, doodles and any other visual elements that would help you remember and understand the material better. You can also make notes and to-do lists, color-code topics and use colored markers to highlight important details. Using this method can help bring more creativity, energy and focus to your studies.",
