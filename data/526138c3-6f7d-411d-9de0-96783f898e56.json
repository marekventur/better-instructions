  "instruction": "Create a new sport that combines elements of basketball and soccer.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The new sport would be called soccetball and it would involve a goal similar to soccer and a court similar to basketball. Instead of dribbling the ball, players would need to pass the ball to teammates, and when the ball enters the area around the goal, it is shot into the goal just like in soccer. Shots from outside that area are taken as two-point shots as in basketball. Players can only touch the ball with their feet and hands. The game would usually involve two teams of five players each.",
