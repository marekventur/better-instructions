  "output": "This infographic summarizes the legal proceedings surrounding Microsoft's antitrust lawsuit. In 1998, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Microsoft alleging that the company had abused its monopoly in the computer operating system market. The case included numerous appeals to various courts, resulting in Microsoft being found guilty and ordered to be broken up into two separate companies by 2000. In 2001, Microsoft and the Justice Department reached a settlement, with Microsoft being ordered to make some significant changes to its business practices. It was also ordered to pay US$750 million in fines and other costs. This antitrust lawsuit has had significant implications for the software industry, leading to increased scrutiny of large technology companies and their business practices. \n![Legal Proceedings Around Microsoft's Antitrust Lawsuit](https://infogram-thumb-",
