  "input": "",
  "output": "A virtual assistant (VA) is an artificial intelligence system that can perform duties traditionally done by humans. In the workplace, virtual assistants can automate mundane tasks like creating meeting notes, scheduling meetings, searching through databases, and managing emails. These tasks can be completed quickly and accurately, freeing up employees' time to focus on more critical tasks. By using a VA, businesses can reduce their labor costs and are able to get more complex tasks done faster and with more accuracy.",
