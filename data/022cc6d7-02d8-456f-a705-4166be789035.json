  "output": "The two major effects of global warming are rising temperatures and extreme weather. Rising temperatures can lead to increased melting of polar ice caps, sea level rise, droughts and heatwaves, which can cause disruptions to agriculture, water availability and public health. Extreme weather events such as storms, floods and wildfires are also becoming more frequent and intense due to global warming.\n// end of output //",
