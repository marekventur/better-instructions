  "output": "Alice was a daydreamer, often finding herself lost in her own thoughts. One afternoon, while wondering what lay beyond the rabbit hole beneath her, she decided to take the plunge. As she fell, she could feel the walls around her shifting, morphing into new shapes and colors. Soon enough, she was thrust into a strange new world - Wonderland.\n\nAlice was mesmerized by the sights and sounds around her. She felt like she could explore forever. Little did she know, her journey would take her to many new and wondrous places, and she'd come face to face with all sorts of odd characters.",
