  "input": "",
  "output": "The phrase \"do not put all your eggs in one basket\" means that one should not rely on a single thing or invest all their resources in one venture. It is important to have multiple sources of income or different options to fall back upon in case one's main venture doesn't succeed. Therefore, it is better to diversify your investments and spread them out to minimize the risk.",
