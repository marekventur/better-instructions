  "output": "Climate change is an urgent and growing crisis, with global weather patterns changing dramatically due to human-caused emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Rising temperatures and more extreme weather events from floods to droughts are already being observed, as well as sea level rise and ocean acidification, tipping the balance of ecosystems around the world. To address the climate crisis, countries must reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases, some of which take decades to centuries to leave the atmosphere. Countries must also invest in clean energy sources such as solar and wind, as well as nature-based solutions such as protecting forests to help absorb carbon dioxide. Citizens can also play their part by reducing their consumption of certain goods and supporting companies making ethical choices. All of these actions taken together can help stem the tide of rising temperatures and avert the very serious consequences of climate change.",
