  "input": "\u03c0",
  "output": "\u03c0 is an irrational number because its exact value can never be determined. Its decimal expansion is infinite and non-repeating. Furthermore, any fraction constructed with \u03c0 in the numerator and denominator is also an irrational number. Therefore, it is impossible to express \u03c0 as a fraction of two integers.",
