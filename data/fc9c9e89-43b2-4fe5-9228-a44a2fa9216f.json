Gandhi led India's successful struggle for independence from the British Empire and his philosophy of nonviolent resistance served as an inspiration for civil rights movements around the world. Mandela's fight against South Africa's oppressive apartheid system was an example of peaceful resistance, and his devotion to democratic ideals has been an inspiration for many.",
