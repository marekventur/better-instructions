  "output": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a network of interconnected nodes to model complex and non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs, inspired by biological neural networks. The information is processed and transmitted between the nodes until a result or output is achieved. ANNs can be used for tasks such as pattern and object recognition, data classification, and prediction.",
