  "input": "",
  "output": "The three types of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Cumulus clouds are large, fluffy, white puffs in the sky. An example would be a white, fluffy cloud on a sunny day. Stratus clouds are wide, flat layers of cloud. An example would be a sheet of low clouds that often covers the sky on a grey, hazey day. Cirrus clouds are thin and wispy, generally found high in the sky. An example would be the thin, high clouds often seen near sunset.",
