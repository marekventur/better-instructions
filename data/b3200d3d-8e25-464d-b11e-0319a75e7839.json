  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a very greedy person who was always looking for ways to get more and more money. He never gave any thought to sharing his wealth with others or making sure everyone had enough for their basic needs. \nOne day, he found a pot of gold. He was so ecstatic that he thought he could finally have all the money he wanted. So, instead of being satisfied with what he had, he kept looking for more, even though it meant taking huge risks. Unfortunately, his luck ran out, and he lost all the money he had. \nHe realized too late the folly of his greed and the danger of chasing after too much without due care. Greed never pays off in the end, and it is always better to be content with what one has.",
