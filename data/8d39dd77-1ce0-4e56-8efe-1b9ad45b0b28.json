  "input": "",
  "output": "A new colour scheme can be created either by choosing a base colour and adding colours to it in different proportions, or by taking a colour palette of several shades and tones. When using this method, it is important to keep in mind the principles of colour harmony and contrast. Additionally, you should aim to create a colour palette that conveys the desired emotion and message of the project.",
