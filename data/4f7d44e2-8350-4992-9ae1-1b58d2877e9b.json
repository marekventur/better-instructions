  "input": "",
  "output": "A tropical monsoon climate is characterized by a hot and humid summer season and a dry winter season. The main features of the tropical monsoon climate include abundant precipitation during the summer months, strong seasonal shifts of both temperature and precipitation, and largely temporal climates. Along with high levels of precipitation during the monsoon season, areas with a tropical monsoon climate can experience heavy cloud cover leading to higher levels of humidity throughout the year. Furthermore, this climate also typically experiences dramatic temperature variation between the cooler winter months and warmer summer months. Lastly, tropical monsoon areas often receive frequent cyclones and other extreme weather events during their monsoon season.",
