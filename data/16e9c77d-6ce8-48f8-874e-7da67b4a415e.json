  "instruction": "Provide a comparative analysis of the economic policies of France and Germany.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "France and Germany have traditionally had different economic policies, with France being a proponent of government intervention and Germany generally taking a more free market approach. The French government is more likely to provide direct state funding, subsidize businesses, and protect domestic industries. By contrast, Germany favors lower taxes and limited regulation, with emphasis on maintaining a budget surplus and low levels of public debt. Both countries favor targeted policies such as research and development tax credits and grants, but they differ in terms of the scope and effectiveness of those policies.",
