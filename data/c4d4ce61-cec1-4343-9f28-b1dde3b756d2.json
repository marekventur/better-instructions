  "input": "",
  "output": "The difference between multiculturalism and cultural diversity is that multiculturalism is an actively encouraged state where people of various backgrounds and cultures are respected and accepted, while cultural diversity is a natural state that exists when people of multiple backgrounds and cultures live together in a society. Multiculturalism promotes the active inclusion and acceptance of cultural diversity, while cultural diversity is a natural phenomenon that can be enhanced and encouraged by celebrating different cultures.",
