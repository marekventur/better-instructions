  "output": "Sleep deprivation can have a serious impact on both physical and mental health. Physically, sleep deprivation can lead to weakened immune system, increased fatigue, impaired cognitive functioning, increased risk of diabetes, weight gain, and stress. Mentally, sleep deprivation has been linked to memory loss and depression, impaired decision-making and problem-solving skills, and decreased motivation and creativity. Long-term sleep deprivation can also lead to certain psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and bipolar disorder. Generally, lack of adequate sleep can have a disorienting effect on the body and mind, making it difficult to function both physically and mentally.",
