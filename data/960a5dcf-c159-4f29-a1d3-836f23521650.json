  "output": "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) which focuses on using algorithms to make predictions about data by building models from sample data. The models can be used for problems like classification, regression, prediction, clustering, and other tasks. The models are often based on algorithms such as decision trees, neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines.",
