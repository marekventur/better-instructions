  "input": "",
  "output": "The Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm and A* algorithm are both path finding algorithms used for solving the shortest path problem in a graph. Both algorithms guarantee to find the optimal path from the source node to the goal node. \n\nThe main difference between these algorithms is that the Dijkstra's algorithm uses a Breadth-first search approach, while the A* algorithm adopts a Heuristic-based search approach. Dijkstra's algorithm is a simple and straightforward pathfinding algorithm, while the A* algorithm is more complex and efficient and uses the heuristic function to determine the most efficient path. Additionally, Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm is not informed and uses uniform-cost search while A* is informed and uses the heuristic cost.",
