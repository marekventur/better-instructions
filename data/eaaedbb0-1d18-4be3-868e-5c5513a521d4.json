  "output": "Intelligence is like a race. Everyone starts at the same starting line, but each person has different abilities and obstacles along the way. Some people catch up quickly, while others take their time. The only way to make it to the finish line is to persistently apply effort and develop strategies that best utilize one's skills and resources. No matter how quickly one reaches the finish line, it's still possible to achieve great things. It's not the speed that matters, it's the journey and the lessons one takes away from it.",
