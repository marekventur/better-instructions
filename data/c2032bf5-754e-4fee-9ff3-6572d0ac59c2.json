  "output": "World War II began in September 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. In April 1940, Germany invaded Scandinavia and then France in May. Germany then launched a major campaign against the Soviet Union in June 1941. In December 1941, Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor, and the United States declared war on Japan the next day. In retaliation, Germany and Italy declared war against the United States. Throughout 1942, Germany was defeated on many fronts including in North Africa, the Atlantic, and the Eastern Front. In June 1944, Allies from both Europe and the Pacific invaded France in the largest amphibious invasion ever \u2013 D-Day. The Allies then advanced toward Germany, and by 1945, Soviet forces advanced through Germany and liberated Nazi concentration camps. Germany surrendered in May 1945 and Japan surrendered a few months later in September 1945, officially ending World War II.",
