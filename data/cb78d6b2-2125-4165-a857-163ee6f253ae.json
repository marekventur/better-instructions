  "output": "In recent years, virtual reality (VR) has become one of the most talked about technologies. Virtual reality is a simulated digital environment that users can interact with using special headsets and controllers. \n\nVR has a broad range of applications. It can be used to create immersive games, training simulations, and even virtual vacations. The technology has rapidly evolved since its launch and is being used in a variety of industries, ranging from healthcare to education.\n\nAt its core, virtual reality functions as an immersive 3D experience. The user wears a headset that is connected to a processing system, usually a gaming PC or console. This system then sends images and audio to the required displays. This means that users can be totally immersed in a virtual world. \n\nVR also offers users the ability to interact with this virtual world. Controllers are used to interact with objects in the environment, and sensors in the headsets provide 360-degree tracking, so users can move naturally through the virtual world. \n\nMany experts believe that virtual reality has the potential to revolutionize the way we experience entertainment, work, and everyday life.",
