  "input": "",
  "output": "A plan to reduce environmental pollution should focus on both reducing our current levels of emissions and energy consumption, as well as creating a clean energy infrastructure. We should transition to a more sustainable, renewable energy economy and reduce our overall reliance on fossil fuels. Conservation practices should be implemented to reduce waste, and smart consumer habits such as choosing local, organic produce, should be encouraged as much as possible. Companies should increasingly adopt more efficient and renewable technologies, such as solar and wind power, in order to reduce their own carbon footprint.",
