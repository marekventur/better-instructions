  "output": "A GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Language model works by using a self-attention mechanism to combine the context of a given text with its preceding text thus making it adept in predicting a suitable next word or sentence. For example, if the preceding sentence is \"The dog was looking for,\" a GPT Language model may suggest \"food\" as the subsequent word with a high rate of confidence.",
