  "instruction": "Describe the motion of a ball rolling off the edge of a table.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The ball will roll off with the force generated from the push of the hand, and the gravitational pull of the Earth. Depending on the angle of the table and the force of the push, the ball will start rolling in an elliptical path downwards at an angle. As it rolls, it will continually change direction and its path will become increasingly curved until it reaches the floor.",
