  "output": "The grandfather had been waiting patiently for what seemed like an eternity. He had heard so much about his new granddaughter whom he had never met. When she finally arrived, she ran into the room with an innocence and joy that could only be felt by a child. He was overwhelmed by the emotion and the sight of her. He knelt down to her level and his eyes lit up with love. She smiled brightly and reached out to give him a big hug. From that moment, the grandfather knew his life would never be the same again.",
