  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a small village nestled in a meadow at the foot of a tall tower. The tower was used by the local villagers for refuge during times of trouble, and with its high walls, it was secure and impenetrable. \n\nOne day, a stranger appeared in the village without warning and accused one of the villagers of a serious crime. Perplexed and outraged, the villagers voted to conduct a trial. The stranger declared that the accused must climb to the top of the tower and if they could make it to the top with a mallet, then they would be found innocent. If they failed, then the stranger would claim that they had fled and were therefore guilty. The accused was terrified, as none had ever made it to the top before. But to their surprise, they succeeded with the aid of the mallet, and the stranger was forced to leave in shame. \nFrom then on, the villagers held a festival once a year to mark the occasion and celebrate the strength of the accused.",
