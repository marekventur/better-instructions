  "output": "Water and oil are similar in that they are both liquid substances, but they have several key differences. Water is composed of molecules made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom and has a lower density than oil. Conversely, oil is composed of molecules of carbon and hydrogen and has a higher density than water. Additionally, water is an excellent conductor of electricity, whereas oil is an insulator of electricity. Water also has a low viscosity, whereas oil is highly viscous.",
