  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between the Gaussian Mixture Model and the K-Means clustering is that the Gaussian Mixture Model is a probabilistic model that can represent an arbitrary cluster shape using a set of gaussian components, while the K-Means clustering is an iterative approach that uses a centralized point (or mean) to define a cluster shape. The Gaussian Mixture Model also provides a measure of confidence, while K-Means does not.",
