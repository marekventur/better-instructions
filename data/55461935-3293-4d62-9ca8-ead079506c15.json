  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change is a pressing environmental and human concern because it poses a threat to the livelihoods of countless people and ecosystems. Temperature increases resulting from climate change have the potential to cause droughts, floods, and other extreme weather conditions that can lead to water shortages, crop failures, and famine. Additionally, extreme weather events put more pressure on already stressed ecosystems, harming biodiversity and leading to more species becoming extinct. Climate change can also lead to rising sea levels that can displace millions of people from their homes and increase the risk of public health problems such as heat-related diseases and water-borne illnesses.",
