  "input": "",
  "output": "Two effects of global warming are rising sea levels and increased species extinction.\n\nRising sea levels are caused by the melting of glaciers and polar ice caps due to warmer temperatures. This results in higher ocean levels, which can lead to flooding and erode coastal areas.\n\nIncreased species extinction is caused by the rapid changes in temperature and other climate factors, leading to disruption of species habitats and the extinction of species whose habitats cannot adapt in time. These effects can ripple through entire ecosystems, leading to further species loss.",
