  "input": "",
  "output": "The Berlin Conference of 1885 was a pivotal moment in the history of Africa. It was a meeting of European powers in which they laid down guidelines for dividing up Africa into colonial spheres of influence. This effectively marked the beginning of the period of colonization in Africa, as the Europeans began to divide up and control the continent. It also set the precedent for the modern nation-state system, with Africa becoming a collection of distinct territories following the lines that were drawn at the conference. As a result, this conference is seen as a major turning point in African history and has gone down in history as the \u201cScramble for Africa\u201d.",
