Mark is attempting to hang a picture above the fireplace, but he just can't seem to do it right. Sarah offers to help but Mark insists he can handle it. \n\nSuddenly, a magical MOUSE appears out of nowhere. He is dressed in a colorful, old-fashioned outfit and is carrying a toolbox and ladder. He sets out to help Mark hang the picture, but instead of using a hammer and nails, he uses magic. \n\nHe waves his wand and the picture is perfectly hung without a single nail. Mark and Sarah can\u2019t believe their eyes. The mouse departs with a sly grin, and the couple laugh in amazement. \n\nTHE END.",
