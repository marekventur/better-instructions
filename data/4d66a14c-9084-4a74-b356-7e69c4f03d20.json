  "instruction": "Compare the US federal tax system to the French federal tax system.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The US federal tax system is characterized by progressive taxation, meaning that individuals and businesses with higher incomes are taxed at higher rates. The tax rate increases as income increases, so those with the highest incomes pay income tax at the highest rate. In contrast, the French federal tax system is characterized by taxation based on income brackets and a flat rate for all citizens. The French also have a wealth tax, which taxes individuals and businesses on the value of their assets rather than their income. Furthermore, the French government combines income and local municipality taxes into one \u201cprincipal tax\u201d at the end of the year.",
