  "input": "",
  "output": "Lawyers and accountants both require strong analytical and problem solving skills, but there are some differences. Lawyers typically need to be detail-oriented and have an extensive knowledge of the law, research capabilities, and a good understanding of legal jargon. Accountants, on the other hand, should have an in-depth knowledge of financial laws, accounting principles, and tax regulations, as well as excellent mathematical and organizational skills. Accountants must also be able to communicate complex financial data effectively. Both professions also require strong communication and interpersonal skills.",
