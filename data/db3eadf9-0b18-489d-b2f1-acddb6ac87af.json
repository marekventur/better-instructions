It is essential for a range of functions in the human body, including the replication, transcription and translation of genetic information. B-DNA is mainly responsible for the formation of proteins, which are the building blocks of many structures and organs in the body. It is also involved in the control of gene expression and metabolism to ensure the proper functioning of the body.",
