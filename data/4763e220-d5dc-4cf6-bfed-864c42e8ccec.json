  "output": "Three techniques for improving communication are active listening and asking questions, using positive language, and using body language and facial expressions. Active listening helps to ensure that both parties feel heard and understood. Asking questions helps to clarify misunderstandings. Using positive language boosts morale and helps to build stronger relationships. Body language and facial expressions can help to convey enthusiasm and show that one is engaged in the conversation.",
