  "output": "Depositing money into a checking account is simple and can be done either in person or electronically. To deposit in person, you can go to the bank or credit union and fill out a deposit slip. Make sure to include your name and account information on the slip. You can then deposit either cash or checks in the appropriate numbered section of the deposit slip. To deposit electronically, you can use an online banking platform or transfer money to your account via direct deposit. Either way, be sure to keep track of the transaction in your records in case there is any need for a later dispute.",
