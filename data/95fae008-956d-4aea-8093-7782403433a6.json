  "input": "Water cycle",
  "output": "The water cycle describes how water moves and is recycled on Earth. Water evaporates from the ocean, rivers and lakes into the atmosphere where it condenses and forms clouds. The clouds move and when they reach areas of lower atmospheric pressure, the water droplets in the clouds become larger and fall as rain or snow. This precipitation then collects on the Earth's surface and flows into rivers, lakes, ponds and eventually returns to the ocean. This cycle is powered by the sun's energy, which evaporates water and drives winds to move the moisture around the planet.",
