  "output": "A popular website is YouTube. YouTube is an online video-sharing platform where users can watch, upload, and share videos. \n\nOne of the main features of YouTube is the ability for users to easily find and share content with others. The website has a search function and a homepage with suggested videos based on users' interests, making it very convenient to browse for different types of content. It also provides users with the ability to create and curate their own channels to share their own videos or those by other creators. This makes it easy for users to discover new content or share their own original videos. \n\nAnother key feature of YouTube is its comment section. The comment section allows viewers to provide feedback to creators, share their thoughts on videos, and connect with fellow viewers. This encourages active engagement with the platform and encourages users to interact in meaningful ways.",
