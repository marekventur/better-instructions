  "output": "Five everyday activities that involve physics are: throwing a ball, riding a bicycle, walking down the stairs, talking, and swinging a pendulum. Throwing a ball involves understanding how the forces of gravity, inertia, and acceleration work together. Riding a bicycle involves understanding how energy is transferred to the pedals and wheels through friction. Walking down the stairs requires understanding how releasing energy alters an object's momentum. Talking involves understanding how sound waves travel through the air. Finally, swinging a pendulum involves understanding how energy is transferred from the center of gravity to the pendulum.",
