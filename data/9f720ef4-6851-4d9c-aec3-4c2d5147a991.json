  "instruction": "Give a detailed description of the differences between Marxism and Capitalism.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Marxism and Capitalism are two antithetical economic theories. Marxism advocates for a classless society and the public ownership of the means of production. This means that all workers would be paid the same and have the same access to resources. Capitalism, on the other hand, is based on free market principles that allow free trade to dictate the terms of the economic system. It promotes private ownership, profit-maximization, and competition among workers to push them to be more productive. Ultimately, Marxism is based on the idea that resources should be used to benefit everyone while Capitalism relies on competition and markets to assign value to goods and services.",
