  "output": "Sensory memory is a very brief memory that lasts for just a few seconds after an experience or event is experienced. It is important for noticing details from the environment and briefly storing the information for a brief period of time. Short-term memory is a type of memory used for temporarily storing and recalling information. It is different from sensory memory in that it can last up to 30 seconds, and can also be manipulated and used more actively. Working memory is a type of short-term memory that allows us to actively use and manipulate information. It is used to solve problems and is rarely held onto for longer than a few minutes. Long-term memory is a type of memory used for storing large amounts of information by permanently encoding it, which involves associating information with prior knowledge so it becomes easier to remember. It can store vast amounts of information which can be retrieved at a later time.",
