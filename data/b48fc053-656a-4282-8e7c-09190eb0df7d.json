  "input": "",
  "output": "Some people choose to remain single because they enjoy their independence and prefer to focus on achieving personal goals rather than being in a relationship. They may feel that they don't need a partner to be happy or fulfilled, or they may want to avoid potential sadness and stress of relationships. Some may also just not have the time to devote to a relationship, or they may find themselves not interested in relationships in general.",
