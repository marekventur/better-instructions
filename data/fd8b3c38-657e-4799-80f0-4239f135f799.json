  "output": "The immigration process to the US involves three main stages: applying for a visa, attending an interview at a US embassy or consulate, and applying for a green card or other immigration status. The visa application requires filling out an online form, submitting documents and financial information, and attending an appointment for biometric testing. The visa interview at the embassy or consulate typically involves questions about the applicant's background and circumstances as well as providing additional documents.
