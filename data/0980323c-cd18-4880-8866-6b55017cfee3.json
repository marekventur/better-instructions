Spotlights focus on each of them, their faces lit up with fear.\n\nFred: We have to find shelter! We can't outrun this storm!\n\nAlice: Is that a building over there?\n\nTim frantically points into the darkness:\n\nTim: Look! Over there!\n\nThe group runs toward the shelter. Once they reach it, they discover it's an old abandoned cabin. They quickly enter, relieved.\n\nAlice: Thank goodness we found somewhere safe from the storm!\n\nSandy: But how long will we be able to stay here?\n\nFred: We'll just have to wait and see.\n\nThe scene fades to black as the group huddles together, taking comfort and strength from one another. The storm rages outside.",
