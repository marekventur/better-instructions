  "input": "",
  "output": "Globalization has had a transformative effect on global economics in the past two decades. The development of new technologies such as the internet and the rise of cheap international transportation has allowed multinational corporations to increasingly operate beyond the boundaries of nation states. This has given birth to large international markets, where goods and services can be quickly and cheaply exchanged.\n\nThe effects of globalization on global economics have been both positive and negative. On the one hand, there has been increased economic growth, increased competition in markets, and greater access to foreign markets. On the other hand, globalization has had some downsides, such as a reduction in labor markets due to the outsourcing of services and employment opportunities, as well as increased inequality across nations.",
