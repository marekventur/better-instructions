  "output": "One unusual vacation spot is The Great Blue Hole in Belize. This is an immense submarine sinkhole with a diameter of over 300 metres and a depth of 125 metres. It is an incredible sight to see, with its unique azure blue colour standing out against the surrounding turquoise Caribbean Sea. There are guided scuba diving tours available, which take adventurers to the bottom of the Hole, where they can observe the unusual marine life and view the limestone formations. Above the surface, visitors can marvel at the surrounding coral reef, which is full of vibrant hues and diverse species of fish.",
