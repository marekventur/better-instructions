  "input": "",
  "output": "Consistency is important in a relationship because it helps to build trust. It allows both partners to feel secure in the relationship and that the other person can be relied upon to honor their promises. Consistency also aids in maintaining a deeper connection between partners, as one can be sure of the other's feelings and that their feelings are also reciprocated. Without consistency, it can be difficult for a relationship to last.",
