  "input": "",
  "output": "The biggest benefits of online courses are flexibility, convenience, and cost savings. They allow students to take classes on their own schedule and from any location, without having to worry about transportation or commuting costs. Traditional courses often offer more face-to-face interaction with instructors and classmates, giving students more chances to ask questions and get feedback. However, traditional courses also have higher associated costs, as they require paying for tuition, books, and materials, as well as commuting time and costs.",
