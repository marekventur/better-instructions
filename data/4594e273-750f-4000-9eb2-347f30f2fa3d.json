  "output": "Albert Einstein's theory of relativity is a theory of gravitation which states that the laws of physics are the same in all uniformly moving frames of reference, regardless of the motion's speed or direction. This means that space and time are bound together, forming a four-dimensional continuum known as \"space-time\". Additionally, this includes the notion of time dilation, where the passage of time speeds up or slows down depending on the speed of the observer.",
