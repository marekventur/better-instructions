  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial neural networks are inspired by the structure and functioning of the brain. They are designed as networks of neurons, just like in the brain, which receive input and give output to create predictions or perform tasks. Artificial neural networks are used to analyze large amounts of data in order to make decisions and recognize patterns. They are similar to how our brains work and they can be used to build computers that can 'think' like humans.",
