  "output": "Inferential statistics is a type of statistical analysis used to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample. It is used to make predictions and generalizations about a larger group of individuals, known as a population, on the basis of information obtained from a smaller group of individuals, known as a sample. It involves the use of statistical tests, such as hypothesis testing, to compare the data from the sample to the population mean. The results of inferential statistics are subject to variability and can be affected by factors such as sample size, population variability, and the nature of the statistical test used. Inferential statistics can be used to understand complex patterns in data and can be used to determine whether a relationship between two or more variables is real or the result of chance.",
