  "output": "A potential ethical dilemma arising from using facial recognition technology is the potential for it to be used as a form of mass surveillance. This could lead to a violation of privacy and potential abuse of the technology. It could also lead to inaccurate or prejudiced decisions being made and lead to a lack of trust in the technology.
