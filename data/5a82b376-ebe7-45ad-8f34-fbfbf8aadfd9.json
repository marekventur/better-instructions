  "input": "",
  "output": "The carbon cycle is the process by which carbon moves between the atmosphere, biosphere, oceans, and geosphere. Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere through respiration, combustion, and fossil fuel burning. It is then taken up by plants during photosynthesis and converted into organic matter. This organic matter is then cycled through the food web before eventually ending up in the ocean. There, organisms like plankton use the carbon dioxide to form shells and other sedimentary rocks which eventually sink to the ocean floor. This carbon dioxide is eventually released back into the atmosphere, thereby creating a cycle.",
