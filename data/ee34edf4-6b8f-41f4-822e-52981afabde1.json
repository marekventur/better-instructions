  "output": "My research suggests that Autism is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is believed that genetics may play a role in the development of the disorder, as some individuals show a higher tendency towards Autism when they have a family history of it. Environmental factors such as stress, diet, or exposure to toxins may also contribute to the development of Autism.",
