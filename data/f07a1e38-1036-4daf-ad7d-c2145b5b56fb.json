  "output": "The first step in planning a climb up Mount Everest is to get in shape through a rigorous exercise program. This includes physical activities such as running and weight training, as well as mental exercises such as meditation and visualization. Additionally, the climber should begin acclimating to the elevation of the mountain by visiting higher altitudes in order to adjust to the reduced oxygen levels. \n\nOnce the climber is prepared in terms of physical and mental readiness, the next step is to obtain the necessary supplies and equipment. This includes items such as proper clothing, food, shelter, and other supplies and tools for the climb. The climber should also ensure that they have safety measures in place such as ropes and carabiners and arrange for emergency personnel to be present in the event something goes wrong. \n\nFinally, the climber must prepare by studying maps, researching the route, and finding out about the various routes of approach and level of difficulty. With a well-thought-out plan in place, the climber has a better chance of reaching the summit and can begin the climb with confidence and enthusiasm.",
