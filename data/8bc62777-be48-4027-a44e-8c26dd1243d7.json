  "instruction": "Compare the differences between a wooden and plastic baseball bat.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Wooden baseball bats are typically heavier and more durable than plastic bats, making them better suited for long term use. Wooden bats generally produce a louder sound when they make contact with the ball, while plastic bats have a quieter sound. Wooden bats have more recoil and vibrations when they hit a ball compared to plastic bats, which have a softer feel. Additionally, wooden bats may have a larger sweet spot that makes contact with the ball more forgiving, while plastic bats are less forgiving.",
