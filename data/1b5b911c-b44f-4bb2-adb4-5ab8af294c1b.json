  "output": "The website should have a visually attractive and intuitive user interface. Users should have the ability to search for hotels by location and date, view detailed information about each hotel, book a room, and complete the reservation process. The website should also provide support for payment processing and other security measures. The website should require users to create an account before they are able to book any rooms.
