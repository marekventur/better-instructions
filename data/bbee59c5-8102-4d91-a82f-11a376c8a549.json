  "input": "",
  "output": "Some common misconceptions about natural language processing include the idea that it can understand all forms of language, can have a conversation with a user, can solve all problems, and that it can replace human intelligence. In reality, natural language processing is simply a computer program that can interpret and analyze language, not a replacement for human intelligence.  Additionally, natural language processing is dependent on a specific context, so it cannot provide conversation or understand all types of language.",
