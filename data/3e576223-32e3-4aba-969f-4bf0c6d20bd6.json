  "output": "Coding is like baking in that both require careful attention to detail, and can produce starkly different results depending on how the instructions are followed. Just as a baker must ensure the correct measurements, timing, and temperature to make the desired pastry, a coder must follow instructions with precision and meticulousness to obtain the desired software or program.",
