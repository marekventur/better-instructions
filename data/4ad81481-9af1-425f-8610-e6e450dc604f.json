The first milestone in human history of space exploration was the launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 in 1957. Since then, humans have achieved many milestones including having humans sent to the Moon, launching numerous satellites and spacecrafts, and having a permanent presence in space with the International Space Station.
