Salinger was born in New York City in 1919, and his works have reflected his own life and experiences growing up in Manhattan. From its publication, The Catcher in the Rye has achieved great success and remains an influential work in literature, especially among the young adult audience. Salinger considered himself a recluse in his later years, turning down interviews and even refusing to accept a prize for his work. He passed away in 2010 in New Hampshire.",
