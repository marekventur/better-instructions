  "output": "The advantages of having a well-structured coding process in the software development process are numerous. A well-structured coding process allows for greater accuracy, since it ensures consistency across the code. It also makes it easier for developers to pick up code from another programmer, as the coding process gives them a clear path to follow. Furthermore, it streamlines the debugging process, since developers can easily identify where mistakes have been made when code does not work as expected. Lastly, a well-structured coding process increases efficiency, since it eliminates the need for debugging errors caused by lack of structure or organization in the code.",
