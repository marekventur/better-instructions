  "input": "",
  "output": "There are several approaches which can be taken to help an elderly parent with memory problems. Firstly, it is important to try to maintain the level of independence and involvement in activities for as long as possible. Encouraging physical activities such as walking, swimming and gardening are positive activities, as well as maintaining strong social connections and feeling a sense of purpose. Carefully structured routines, clear visual cues such as labels and lists and habits also help to reduce confusion and stress. Above all, it is important to be patient and understanding and to provide supportive, thoughtful care.",
