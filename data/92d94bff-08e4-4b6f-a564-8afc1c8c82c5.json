  "output": "The leaves dance in their sway, \nA farewell to the sun where it lay. \nThe night creeps in, a chill in the air, \nAs days turn to night and every hair stands on end.\n\nA blanket of snow buries the ground, \nBright colours turning to white and soundless abound.\nA chill in the air, that can take away all pain,\nAs the days get brighter and the snow begins to wane.\n\nThe flowers start to bloom,\nBringing in a much needed respite after winter's gloom.\nFruits, vegetables, and a splash of colour,\nA reminder that life can be sweeter, so much better. \n\nA change of season brings with it hope, \nA fresh start and a chance for us to cope.\nThe past is the past and the present is new,\nA reminder within us that the changing of seasons is true.",
