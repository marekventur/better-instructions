  "input": "",
  "output": "The Principle of Least Privilege is a security principle that states that users and processes should be granted only the minimal level of privileges necessary to perform their job, and that are not used to perform any other function. This means that users should not be granted more privileges or access to resources than is necessary for their task, as these extra privileges may create a greater risk of unauthorized access to the system or be exploited in other ways. The Principle of Least Privilege thus serves as a way of minimizing the chances of a malicious user or process being able to gain access to restricted or sensitive data.",
