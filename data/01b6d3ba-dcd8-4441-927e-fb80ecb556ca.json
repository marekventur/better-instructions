  "output": "In 2019, the Indian government announced plans to increase the number of banking outlets in the country by 10,000 in the next two years. This move is designed to improve access to banking services for underserved communities and further boost financial inclusion.\n\nThe government also launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), a national mission to provide affordable banking services to individuals who are financially excluded. The financial inclusion program seeks to increase access to banking services and encourage low-income people to open bank accounts.\n\nThe government is also introducing a number of initiatives to increase bank credit and reduce the incidence of financial exclusion including:\n\n\u2022 Allowing banks to refinance retail and SME loans.\n\u2022 Establishing Credit Guarantee Fund Trusts for MSMEs by the Government of India to provide guarantees for loans up to Rs 5 crore.\n\u2022 Offering tax incentives to encourage banks to lend more to the MSME sector. \n\u2022 Reduced Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements for opening bank accounts.\n\u2022 Strengthening consumer protections through amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\n\u2022 Implementing a Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a real-time payments system for customers to transfer money electronically. \n\nThese changes are designed to improve access to banking services across India, reduce financial exclusion and promote growth in the banking sector.",
