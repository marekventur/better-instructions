  "output": "Psychoanalysis is a psychological approach developed by Sigmund Freud that uses a set of techniques aimed at uncovering hidden or repressed feelings, drives, and memories. Psychoanalysis seeks to understand the origin and nature of psychological distress and focuses on the ways in which an individual's psyche affects his or her behavior and mental wellbeing. Some of the core principles of psychoanalysis include the recognition of unconscious processes, the role of the past in shaping present behavior, the importance of relationships, and the power of free association. It emphasizes the exploration of feelings, dreams, fantasies and memories in order to gain insight into unconscious conflicts. Psychoanalysis is a theory of personality and a method of psychotherapy.",
