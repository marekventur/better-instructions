  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of how technology can be used to reduce waste is through the use of 3D printing. Instead of buying large amounts of products, 3D printing can be used to design and produce items as they are needed - reducing the amount of waste created by excess inventory. Another example is the use of machine learning to monitor and optimize production processes, ensuring items are made only when needed and eliminating waste from excess production.",
