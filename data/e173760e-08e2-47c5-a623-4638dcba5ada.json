  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the following programming language: C++ and Python.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "C++ is an object-oriented language that is compiled, while Python is an interpreted, high-level language that is used for general-purpose programming. C++ is a statically-typed language, meaning that it requires the declaration of all variables used in the program before any code is written, while Python is a dynamically-typed language that requires no such declarations.\n\nC++ has a more complex syntax compared to Python and C++ is generally more difficult to learn and master. Python code is often shorter and easier to read and maintain, making it easier to maintain complex applications. C++ has better performance, while Python is more efficient in terms of time and space complexity. C++ focuses on system programming, while Python is more geared towards web development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.",
