  "output": "Working from home isn't always better than working in an office. In an office, people have more opportunities to collaborate and network with other colleagues. There are more social interactions and more chances to develop relationships that benefit all parties. Plus, there can be distractions in one's own home that hinder productivity. Working in a professional office environment may be the best way to get the most out of employees.",
