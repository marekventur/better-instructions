  "instruction": "Explain why the ocean is salty",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The ocean is salty because of the continuous cycle of evaporation and precipitation. When ocean water evaporates, the salts remain behind in the ocean, making the water saltier. Additionally, soil runoff from rivers carries salts from the land into the sea, making the ocean saltier. Furthermore, when water evaporates from the surface of the ocean, the salts and minerals left behind become increasingly concentrated and contribute to the saltiness of the ocean.",
