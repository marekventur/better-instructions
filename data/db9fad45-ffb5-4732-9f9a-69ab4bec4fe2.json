  "output": "People tend to hoard information for a variety of reasons. On an individual level, hoarding information can help people gain power or feel in control. It can be a way to gain an advantage over others or to gain a greater understanding of a particular subject. On a societal level, hoarding information can be a form of self-protection or a way of preserving knowledge and culture.
