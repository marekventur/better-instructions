  "input": "",
  "output": "Three classification algorithms are Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, and Naive Bayes. Support Vector Machines use a hyperplane to classify data points. Random Forests use decision trees to predict data classes. And Naive Bayes classifies data based on the assumption of independence between features.",
