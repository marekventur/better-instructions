  "input": "",
  "output": "Preserving animal habitats is important for maintaining populations of wildlife and supporting biodiversity. When habitats are destroyed or fragmented, animal species lose their homes and food sources, which can lead to increased mortality rates and reduced reproductive success. Preserving animal habitats helps to ensure that there will be enough resources for all species, enabling them to thrive and, ultimately, helping to maintain balance in ecosystems.",
