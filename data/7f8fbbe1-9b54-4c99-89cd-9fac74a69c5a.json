  "input": "",
  "output": "When the sun rises, the day of a zoo keeper begins. After the zoo gates open, they start their day with the morning rounds, checking on the animals and making sure they are all healthy and happy. In between performing maintenance, giving food, and cleaning the enclosures, they get to talk to the visitors and teach them interesting facts about the animals.\n\nIn the afternoon, the zoo keeper gets to experience all the wild life firsthand, from teaching the chimpanzees to swing from one branch to the next, cleaning out the lion enclosure, or even just the pleasure of observing a lazy elephant in its natural habitat. \n\nAt night, the zoo keeper is responsible for the security of the creatures in their care. It is the perfect time to double check all the enclosures, make sure no predators have breached the perimeters, and enjoy the serene beauty of the night sky. \n\nNo one day is ever the same for the zoo keeper - just when they think they've seen it all, something new and wonderful catches their eye and fills their day with joy.",
