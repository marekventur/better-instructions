  "output": "1. First, identify the line that is causing the issue. Look through the code and check each line until you find the one with the problem. \n2. Once you\u2019ve identified the line, see if 'x' is defined anywhere. If not, then you need to define 'x' before you can use it. \n3. If 'x' is defined somewhere else, check that it is being passed to this line correctly. Look at the variable and make sure its value is correct.\n4. If 'x' is defined correctly, then look for any logic errors that may be causing the error. Check that your conditional statements are correct and that any operators are functioning properly. \n5. If you still can\u2019t identify the issue, try adding console.log() statements to track what the code is doing at each step. This will help you identify where the issue is coming from.",
