  "input": "",
  "output": "A natural language model is an AI model that is trained on natural language data and can be used to generate meaningful and contextual outputs. A GPT language model, on the other hand, is a type of natural language model that is based on the transformer architecture and is used to generate words and text. Unlike a natural language model, a GPT model does not need to be specifically trained for a task, as it can generate text from raw input data.",
