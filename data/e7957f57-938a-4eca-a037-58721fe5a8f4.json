The objective of the game is to get a small rubber ball into the opposing team's goal by using a long pole with a handle, referred to as a 'flipper.' Players can move the ball by flipping it with their flipper and they can block shots by catching the ball with their flipper. The team with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.",
