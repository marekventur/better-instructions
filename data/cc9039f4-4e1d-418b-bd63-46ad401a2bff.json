  "output": "A creative way to make use of a leftover can of soup is to make soup dumplings. Make dumpling dough by combining flour, salt, and warm water. Then, combine the soup with chopped vegetables and seasonings. Take small pieces of the dough and flatten them into circles. Place a spoonful of the soup mixture in each circle and close them up to make dumplings. Boil the dumplings for a few minutes until they are cooked through.",
