  "input": "",
  "output": "I propose a new NLP algorithm based on the concept of Multi-Layer Clustering. This algorithm will take as input a group of unlabeled text data and will attempt to identify distinct subgroups within this data. After the clusters are identified, the algorithm will label each cluster with a keyword or phrase that best describes the topics within that cluster. Finally, the algorithm will use these labels to identify similar clusters of data across various sources for the purpose of categorizing and organizing the datasets.",
