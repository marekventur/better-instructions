  "instruction": "Design a high-level architecture of how an autonomous car works.",
  "input": "<no input>",
  "output": "The architecture for an autonomous car consists of several different components, working together to create an autonomous vehicle. The components of an autonomous car include the following:\n\n1. Sensors - These are used to detect the environment around the car, such as obstacles, lanes, speed bumps and other relevant objects. They usually include cameras, LiDAR sensors, radar, and ultrasonic sensors.\n\n2. Localization - This component uses the data from the sensors to precisely identify the car's position and orientation in the world.\n\n3. Mapping - This component maps the environment around the car in a 2D or 3D model for the car to use.\n\n4. Computer - This component processes the data from the sensors and uses the mapping information to decide what the car should do.\n\n5. Decision-making - This component takes the decisions from the computer and coordinates the actuators and the vehicular system to control the car's motion.\n\n6. Actuators - This component carries out the decisions to control the car, including the steering wheel, brakes, gears, and throttle.\n\n7. Internal Monitoring - This component monitors the car systems, such as the batteries, suspension, engine and more, and sends updates to the computer to ensure it remains in optimal working condition.\n\n8. Connectivity - This component allows the car to connect to the internet, and other data sources, to receive updates, warnings, and other relevant information. \n\nWhen all these components work together, the autonomous car can navigate through its environment, detect obstacles, follow paths, react to traffic laws and even take shortcuts.",
