  "output": "The primary role of contact tracing in limiting the spread of disease is to identify and monitor people who have been in contact with an infected person. This helps track the progress of a disease and identify who needs to be tested or quarantined. Contact tracing can also provide real-time updates to health care professionals and enable them to more quickly identify diseases and their potential sources. Additionally, it helps to target resources and focus on areas with higher infection rates.",
