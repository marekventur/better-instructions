  "instruction": "Come up with a solution to reduce traffic congestion.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One solution to reduce traffic congestion is to implement public transit options. This could include expanding existing public transportation systems and introducing carpooling incentives. Ridership could also be encouraged through investments in attractive subway stations, bike lanes, and bus stops. Another solution is to introduce congestion pricing, which would increase the cost of driving during peak hours. This would make taking public transit a more attractive option for commuters.",
