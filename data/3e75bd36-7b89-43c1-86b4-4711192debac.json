  "instruction": "Compare an electric car with a petrol-powered car in terms of environmental impact.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Electric cars produce significantly fewer emissions than petrol-powered cars. They are powered by electricity from renewable sources, which reduces their environmental impact. Electric cars do not produce carbon dioxide, particulate matter, or other harmful pollutants, so they are better for the environment. Additionally, electric cars are more efficient than petrol-powered cars and they help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making them a greener way to get around.",
