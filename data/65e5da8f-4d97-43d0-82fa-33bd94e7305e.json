  "input": "",
  "output": "SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a secure protocol that helps protect data transferred over the Internet by encrypting it. It works by creating a private, encrypted connection between a server and a client. The server authenticates the client and the client is authenticated by the server. Once the secure connection has been established all communication between the two is encrypted, preventing any malicious third parties from viewing the exchange.",
