  "input": "",
  "output": "A method to protect against SQL injection attacks is to use parameterized queries, also known as prepared statements. Parameterized queries allow user data to be securely passed to a database by using variables instead of using direct user input. This makes it difficult for malicious users to manipulate the parameters used in the query and prevents SQL injection attacks.",
