  "output": "France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its main democratic institutions in place since the French Revolution. Its current president is Emmanuel Macron and its prime minister is Jean Castex. The French legislative branch is bicameral, with the National Assembly and the Senate making up the legislature. France is a member of the European Union and part of the eurozone, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. In recent years, the country has seen a strong push for more left-leaning policies, including the legalization of gay marriage and adoption, as well as reforms of the country\u2019s economic structures. France has also seen a sharp rise in immigration from Africa and the Middle East, which has been met with both acceptance and tension from the population.",
