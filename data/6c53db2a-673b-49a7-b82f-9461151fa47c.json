  "input": "",
  "output": "The sound in a film is incredibly important as it can convey different tones and create a unique atmosphere. It can be used to signify a shift in mood, evoke emotion in its audiences, and give a sense of place and time. For example, horror films may use sharp, sudden notes to increase tension and suspense. Whereas, romantic films may rely on more subtle instruments to build an emotional connection between the characters on-screen. Sound can also be used to emphasize certain moments and enhance the overall experience of watching a film.",
