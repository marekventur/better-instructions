The Sacral Chakra, or Svadhisthana, is located near the belly button and is associated with emotions, pleasure, and sexuality. The Solar Plexus Chakra, or Manipura, is a few inches above the navel and is associated with confidence and personal power. The Heart Chakra, or Anahata, is located at the center of the chest and is associated with relationships and love. The Throat Chakra, or Vishuddha, is located in the throat and is associated with communication and expression. The Third Eye Chakra, or Ajna, is located between the brows and is associated with intuition, insight, and wisdom.
