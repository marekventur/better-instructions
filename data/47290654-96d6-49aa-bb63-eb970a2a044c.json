  "input": "Access to Healthcare",
  "output": "Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right. Despite this, billions of people remain unable to access quality healthcare. This is partly due to economic and geographic factors that leave people in remote areas or low-income households unable to receive care. To tackle this problem, governments are implementing policies that focus on the expansion of healthcare facilities, meeting the rising demand for accessible and affordable care. Additionally, governments are also working to make healthcare systems more equitable, and public education initiatives are helping to raise awareness of how people can access healthcare more easily. Ultimately, access to quality healthcare is a fundamental human right, and governments must strive to ensure that everyone has access to the care they need.",
