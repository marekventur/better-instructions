  "input": "Chicken Parmesan\nIngredients:\n- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n- 2 eggs, beaten\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 1/2 cup Italian-style bread crumbs\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 1/2 cups marinara sauce\n- 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese",
  "output": "Variations of this classic Chicken Parmesan recipe include substituting chicken thighs for the chicken breasts and adding spinach, basil, or other herbs to the bread crumb mixture. To make a lighter version, you can bake the chicken and skip the frying. For a heartier meal, you can add extra vegetables to the marinara sauce, such as bell peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini. You can also replace the Italian-style bread crumbs with crushed crackers, or try adding other cheeses such as cheddar, Monterey Jack, or blue cheese.",
