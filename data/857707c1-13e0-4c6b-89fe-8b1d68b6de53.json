  "input": "",
  "output": "The logo should be designed in an abstract, modern style. It should feature an illustration of a globe surrounded by four arrows, each one pointing to a different corner of the globe. The globe should be cartoonish and colorful, conveying a sense of adventure. The arrows should be vibrant and eye-catching, expressing energy and movement. The logo should be simple, yet sophisticated, and should capture the idea of exploration, discovery, and freedom.",
