  "output": "Bees are important pollinators and play an important role in the ecosystem. They have many important duties including making honey, gathering nectar and pollen, and pollinating flowers. They are social insects and work together in a hive to build the honeycomb cells, the queen bee, and their larva. Bees also create their own wax from which they make their honey combs. Finally, bees can communicate with other bees using their own form of \"dancing\" to pass on information about the location of food sources.",
