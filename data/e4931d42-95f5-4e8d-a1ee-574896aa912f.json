  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change has had a devastating effect on glaciers around the world, leading to their rapid melting and decreased volume. This is expected to have severe consequences on both ecosystems and humans, as glaciers act as a significant water source and their reduced volume could cause drastic changes in water availability in the years ahead. Therefore, it is essential to implement measures to reduce the causes of climate change and protect glaciers from further damage.",
