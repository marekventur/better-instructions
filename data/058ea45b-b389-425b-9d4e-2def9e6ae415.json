  "input": "",
  "output": "Algorithms can be biased if they are trained and tested on data sets that do not represent the full diversity of the population or that contain built-in biases and assumptions. Additionally, algorithms can become biased if they are trained on data sets containing irrelevant or harmful variables that contribute to inaccurate or unfair outputs. For example, an algorithm that is trained on historical data containing gender, race, or age biases can perpetuate these biases in its predictions. The bias can then be propagated in all the decisions the algorithm makes based on its predictions.",
