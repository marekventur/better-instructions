  "instruction": "Classify paper towels into different types",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Paper towels can be classified into several different types, including recycled, re-usable, jumbo/bulk/economy, economy-size/jumbo, and thick/strong. Recycled paper towels are made from 100% post-consumer recycled content and can help reduce waste. Re-usable paper towels are machine washable, making them a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly option. Jumbo/bulk/economy paper towels are larger in size and more cost-effective in the long-run since fewer sheets are needed. Economy-size/jumbo paper towels are even larger and even more cost-effective. Finally, thick/strong paper towels are designed to be more durable and absorbent.",
