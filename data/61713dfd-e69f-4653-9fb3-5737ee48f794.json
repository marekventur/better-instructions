  "output": "Solar and wind energy are both renewable energy sources used to generate electricity. Solar energy uses the sun's rays to convert them into electricity, while wind energy harnesses the power of the wind. While solar requires more upfront costs to install, it produces more reliable energy, while wind is free, but less predictable.",
