  "input": "Friend is an engineer who recently graduated.",
  "output": "I understand your confusion about your career direction. It's important to take some time to consider what you really value in life and a job. Are you looking for interesting projects, more responsibility or something else? Once you have identified what matters the most to you, it will be easier to narrow the range of opportunities that align with your personal values. It's also important to be open to new experiences and to build connections with people in different fields. Don't be afraid to try something unfamiliar or to reach out to someone with a different area of expertise. You never know what may come of it!",
