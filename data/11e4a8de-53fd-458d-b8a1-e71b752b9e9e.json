  "input": "",
  "output": "The best way to store potatoes for prolonged usage is to keep them in a cool, dry, dark place with good air circulation. Place the potatoes in a mesh or burlap bag in a cabinet or pantry and avoid storing them in the refrigerator, which can cause them to spoil more quickly. Make sure the potatoes are in a dark area and away from sources of heat or direct light. Check on the potatoes every few weeks to make sure they are still in good shape and discard any that have begun to rot or sprout.",
