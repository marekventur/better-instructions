  "output": "When caring for a toddler, a nurse should always be vigilant and attentive as toddlers have a lot of energy and can get into trouble quickly. It is important to establish routines and schedule activities, maintain a clean and safe environment, and provide appropriate discipline. It is also important to provide healthy snacks and meals, encourage physical activity, and limit screen time. Good communication with the toddler and the parents is key to ensure a healthy, positive relationship.",
