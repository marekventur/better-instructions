  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm should take into account factors such as amount of purchase, type of purchase, geographic location, payment method, and time of transaction. It should then compare these factors to past transactions and customer behavior to detect any anomalies or suspicious activity. If anything suspicious is found, the algorithm should alert the appropriate parties and provide the customer with extra verification steps.",
