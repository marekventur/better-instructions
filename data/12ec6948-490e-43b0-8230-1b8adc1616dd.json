  "input": "",
  "output": "This algorithm will sort numbers from least to greatest. \n\nStep 1: Begin with an array of unsorted numbers. \nStep 2: Set two variables; \"min\" and \"index\". \nStep 3: Iterate through the array. \nStep 4: Compare each value with \"min\". \nStep 5: If the value is less than \"min\", update min and record the index of the value. \nStep 6: After each iteration, swap the value at the index of \"min\" with the value at the beginning of the array. \nStep 7: The beginning of the array is now the smallest value. \nStep 8: Repeat steps 3-7 for the remaining elements until everything is in order.",
