  "instruction": "What is the probability of rolling a total of 13 when rolling two dice?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The probability of rolling a total of 13 when rolling two dice is 2/36 or 1/18. This is because there are two possible combinations that will produce a total of 13 when rolling two dice - 6 and 7, and 5 and 8. To calculate the probability, divide the number of possible combinations (2) by the total number of combinations (36). Thus, the probability of rolling a total of 13 when rolling two dice is 2/36 or 1/18.",
