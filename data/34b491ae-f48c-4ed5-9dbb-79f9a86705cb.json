  "input": "",
  "output": "Animals often adapt to their living environment by developing new skills to increase their chance of survival. For example, an animal may adjust its eating habits to better access available food sources, such as a bear catching fish or a bird picking up small insects with its beak. They may also alter their markings or colors to blend into their surroundings, like the chameleon\u2019s ability to camouflage itself with its environment. Other animals may migrate to areas of the world where they can better survive and reproduce. Migration often occurs in response to drastic changes in the environment such as seasons, weather or availability of food. By using these adaptive behaviors, animals can ensure they will have a better chance at surviving and thriving in their respective ecosystems.",
