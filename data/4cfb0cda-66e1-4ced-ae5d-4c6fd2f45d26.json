  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the properties of two elements from the periodic table",
  "input": "Lithium and Sodium",
  "output": "Lithium and Sodium are both alkali metals from Group 1 of the periodic table. Lithium is the lightest metal, with the atomic number 3, and Sodium is the sixth lightest, with the atomic number 11. Both metals are relatively reactive, but Lithium is the most reactive of the two. They both form compounds with other elements, but Sodium tends to form larger amounts of compounds. Sodium is also much more abundant than Lithium in the Earth's crust. Lithium has a much lower boiling point than Sodium and it can be used as a heat transfer medium in certain types of automobile engines.",
