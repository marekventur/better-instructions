  "input": "The writings of Friedrich Nietzsche have often been accused of promoting nihilism, the belief that life is without meaning or purpose. Though nihilism is certainly present in Nietzsche's work, it does not represent a central feature of his philosophy. Instead, Nietzsche believes that life is meaningful and that we must create our own meaning and purpose. He argues that since there is no higher power or external source of meaning, we must find or create meaning for ourselves.",
