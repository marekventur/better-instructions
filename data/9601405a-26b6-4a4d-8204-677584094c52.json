  "output": "Person 1: We should use the SUS method to evaluate the usability of our software. It is a reliable metric that has been proven to provide valuable insights.\nPerson 2: But a survey cannot be used to evaluate usability accurately. Even if surveys don't provide an exact usability score, they can provide valuable information about how users interact with the system and reveal user preferences which can help inform further changes to the design. Furthermore, surveys are a more cost-effective solution than a full usability test and can be used to quickly pinpoint issues that may need to be addressed.",
