  "input": "",
  "output": "The US and Indian education systems differ significantly in terms of structure, funding, and quality of resources. In the US, educational systems benefit from well-developed strategies and investment from the government, while in India the education system is largely private or locally funded, leading to unequal access to quality education. Additionally, the US system emphasizes on creativity and critical thinking while Indian education focuses on rote memorization and following the status quo.",
