  "output": "The techniques used to find data anomalies are statistical analysis, clustering, and outlier detection. Statistical analysis is used to detect anomalies by evaluating the distribution of data in relation to a normal distribution. Clustering is used to detect anomalies by grouping similar data points together, and outlier detection is used to identify data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data.",
