  "input": "",
  "output": "When two comets collide, they typically break apart and create an intersection of dust, rock, and ice particles. The collision produces a spectacular light show with intense heat and radiation, and characteristically leaves a trail of ionized gas in its wake. The dust particles from the collision can eventually move away from the collision and form a new comet or meteors.",
