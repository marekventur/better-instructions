  "input": "",
  "output": "Primary producers are the organisms in an ecosystem that produce organic compounds from sunlight or chemicals. This process is known as primary production and forms the base of the food chain. Primary producers are essential to any healthy ecosystem, providing the food and energy necessary for other organisms such as fish or birds to survive. Green plants are the most common type of primary producer, but some producers, such as certain types of bacteria, produce energy through chemosynthesis.",
