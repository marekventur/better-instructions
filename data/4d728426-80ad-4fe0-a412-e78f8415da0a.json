  "input": "",
  "output": "Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau both believed that government is necessary for society\u2019s stability, but they had different views on the purpose of government and its role in society. Hobbes believed that government should be strong and absolute so that it could protect its citizens from harm. He discounted the natural goodness of man and believed that a powerful state would be necessary to prevent chaos and instability. Rousseau, on the other hand, believed that government should exist to protect the natural rights of people and to ensure the freedom of its citizens. He argued that government should be created by the people and serve their interests, rather than controlling them. He saw government as a force for good and believed that it was essential to a functioning society.",
