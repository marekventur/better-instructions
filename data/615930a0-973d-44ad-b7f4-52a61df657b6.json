  "input": "",
  "output": "Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection has both strengths and weaknesses. One of its main strengths is that it provides a plausible and widely accepted explanation for the process of evolution that has been tested and supported by many scientific studies. Its weaknesses include its focus solely on competition as a driver of evolution and its inability to explain the influence of random events such as genetic drift on the process.",
