  "input": "A polynomial equation is an equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and x is a variable. Polynomial equations can be solved either by factorization or by using the quadratic formula. Factorization involves breaking the equation down into factors which can be manipulated to produce a solution. The quadratic formula is an alternative approach to solving polynomial equations.",
