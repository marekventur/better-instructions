  "output": "Parallelism in grammar is a stylistic device which involves repeating similar structure in a sentence or a phrase. It refers to the grammatical structure of words, phrases, and clauses in a sentence, in which the parts are of the same length, grammatical form, and meaning. Parallelism helps to create sentences that are balanced, unified, and emphasize certain parts of a text for a greater impact on the reader.",
