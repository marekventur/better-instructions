  "output": "John was a brilliant student with a hardworking nature. But in Chemistry, he was struggling to keep up. He was confused by the formulas and equations in the book and the lectures seemed to flow over his head at times. He tried his best to stay focused in class and listen carefully but the subject often seemed daunting to him. He was determined to succeed however, so to help himself, he stayed up late studying the subject and reading up on it every day. He continued to practice and eventually he came to understand the concepts better and made progress with the subject. In the end, he was proud of himself for having put in such effort and becoming a better student.",
