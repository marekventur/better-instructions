  "instruction": "Read the following text and identify which grammar rules were violated.",
  "input": "I saw two dog and a cat.",
  "output": "In this sentence, the grammar rules that were violated are the plural subject-verb agreement and the indefinite article usage. The subject of the sentence is \"two dog\", which should be \"two dogs\". Additionally, the indefinite article \"a\" should be used before a word beginning with a consonant, whereas in this case the subject is a word beginning with a vowel (\"cat\"), and so the article should be \"an\".",
