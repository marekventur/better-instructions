  "output": "Five items of clothing needed to survive in cold weather are quality thermal underwear, heavy winter coat, insulated hat and gloves, waterproof boots, and waterproof snow pants. Thermal underwear helps to keep the body warm by trapping the body heat from escaping. A heavy winter coat will provide a layer of insulation. Insulated hats and gloves are essential for protecting the hands, head and neck and preventing them from getting too cold. Waterproof boots and snow pants will help protect your feet and legs from the wet and cold elements.",
