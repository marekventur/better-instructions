  "output": "The purpose of cryptography is to protect data and communications against unauthorized access and alteration. Cryptographic algorithms are used to transform plain text into a secret code that can only be read by the intended recipient, usually via a cryptographic key. This makes it difficult for unauthorized parties to access and understand the data, making it a powerful tool for data security.",
