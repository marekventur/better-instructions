  "instruction": "Compare student debt crisis in the US and Canada.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The student debt crisis is a major issue for both the US and Canada, although there are some differences between the two countries. In the US, student debt reached a record $1.5 trillion in 2019, with the average student owing around $32,600. In Canada, the debt situation is not as dire as in the US, but still a cause for concern. The average student debt in Canada is around $26,300, and total student debt reached over $35.4 billion in 2019. Canada does have some advantages compared to the US, such as more generous government loan programs which have allowed students to pay back the loans at lower rates. However, student debt in both countries has been steadily rising in recent years, and is likely to remain a major issue.",
