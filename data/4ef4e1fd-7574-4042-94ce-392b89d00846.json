  "output": "Adam Smith and Karl Marx had different views on economics. Smith believed in free-market capitalism and the power of individual self-interest, while Marx proposed a class-based economic system. Smith argued that competition would benefit everyone as individuals look to maximize their own profits, while Marx argued that workers' interests should be taken into consideration and competition would lead to inequality.",
