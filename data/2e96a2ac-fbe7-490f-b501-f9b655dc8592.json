  "output": "I am excited to introduce a new technology that can revolutionize the way we monitor our health. It is a wearable device with embedded sensors and artificial intelligence technology. The sensors can detect changes in the environment and scan the body to measure vital signs such as heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate. The AI system can then use this data to track the user's health and even give personalized recommendations for preventive measures.",
