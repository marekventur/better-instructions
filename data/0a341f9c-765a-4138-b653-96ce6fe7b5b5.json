  "input": "",
  "output": "The law of supply and demand is an economic concept that states that the price of a good or service is determined by both the supply and the demand for it. When there is an increase in demand, the price of the good or service tends to rise, whereas when there is an increase in supply, the price tends to fall. In other words, the law of supply and demand states that prices are determined by the balance between the quantity of a good or service that is supplied and the quantity that is demanded.",
