  "output": "The Solar System model proposed by Copernicus is based on the heliocentric theory, which states that the Earth and other planets revolve around the sun. This model is more mathematically efficient than the Ptolemaic system and explains the retrograde motion of planets more accurately. It also states that the Earth rotates on its axis once per day and that its orbit is an ellipse rather than a circle.",
