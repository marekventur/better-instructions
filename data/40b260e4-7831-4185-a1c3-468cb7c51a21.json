  "output": "My signature smoothie recipe is a delicious mix of mango, banana, and pineapple. To make the smoothie, blend 1 frozen banana, 1 cup of frozen mango chunks, and 1/2 cup of pineapple chunks in a blender until creamy. Add 1/2 cup of coconut milk to thin the smoothie. Finally, blend again until all ingredients are mixed. This smoothie is perfect for a refreshing breakfast or snack.",
