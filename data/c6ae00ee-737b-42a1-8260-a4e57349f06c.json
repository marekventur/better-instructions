  "instruction": "Identify the use of specific sounds in the following film clip.",
  "input": "<video clip>",
  "output": "The use of specific sounds in the film clip is varied and effective. The background score is composed of low, atmospheric strings and percussion to give an overall moody, slightly ominous feeling throughout. Additionally, the sound effects help to heighten the suspense of the scene, with the sound of a door opening and closing, creaking floors, and birds chirping. Additionally, a low, electronic humming sound is heard throughout the clip, as well as an eerie, bubbling sound in the second half. These sounds all work together to amplify the tension and mystery of the story and create a unique sonic landscape.",
