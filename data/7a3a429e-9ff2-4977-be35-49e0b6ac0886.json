  "input": "",
  "output": "An example of a machine learning solution is a self-driving car. This uses sensors and cameras to detect objects on the roadway, then combines this information with data from a map of the surrounding area to determine a safe route for the car to travel. Machine learning algorithms are then used to help the car make decisions such as when to accelerate, brake, and turn.",
