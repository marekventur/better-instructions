  "input": "",
  "output": "Two people enter a cozy restaurant and are warmly welcomed by their friendly server. As they peruse the menu, they discuss what dishes look the most appetizing. They decide to both order the daily special and eagerly await their food. As they eat and chat, the two find that the food is even better than what the menu suggested. They make a mental note to come back and try other dishes.",
