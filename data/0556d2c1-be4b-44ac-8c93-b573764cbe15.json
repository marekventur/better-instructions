  "input": "",
  "output": "Manta rays are remarkable creatures, capable of gracefully gliding through the water with as little as two wing strokes per minute. A new study has revealed the secret behind manta ray flying ability, finding that the way their wings bend and rotate creates lift, allowing them to achieve flight-like characteristics. This seemingly simple task requires precise and effective movement of the pectoral fin, and it is believed that the unique arrangement of their fin allows them to achieve this feat. By understanding the details of this process, researchers hope to be able to apply this knowledge to the development of new flying robots and swimming drones.",
