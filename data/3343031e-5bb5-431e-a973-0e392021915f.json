  "output": "A nightmare scenario for a project would be a scenario in which the deadline approaches and nothing has been completed. The team is overwhelmed, frustrated and feeling hopeless, unable to make progress on the goals set out for the project. The project is behind schedule, overbudget and everyone is exhausted, demoralized and burned out. The team is unable to mobilize and become productive or deliver the project on time, leading to decreased customer satisfaction and a loss of credibility with customers, partners, and stakeholders.",
