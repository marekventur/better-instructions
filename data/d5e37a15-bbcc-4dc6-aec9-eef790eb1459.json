  "instruction": "Design an algorithm to compare the words in two strings and determine the similarity between them.",
  "input": "String 1: \"backpack fabric\"\nString 2: \"fabric pack\"",
  "output": "The algorithm should compare the words in each string and calculate the number of matching words, then divide it by the total word count of both strings. For example, in the two strings above, the words \"backpack\" and \"pack\" match and both words are present in both strings. So, the similarity score between the two strings would be 2 divided by 4, or 0.5.",
