  "input": "",
  "output": "Creating a sentiment analysis tool involves a few steps. First, you will need to collect data that contains sentiment, such as movie reviews or tweets. Once you have collected the data, you will need to preprocess it so that words are in the correct format to be used in the model. Second, you will need to split the data into training and testing sets. Third, you will need to create a neural network model to classify the sentiment of the data. The model should be able to take input text and output a numerical value (e.g. 1 for positive or 0 for negative). Finally, you will need to evaluate the performance of the model. This can be done by testing it on unseen data and comparing the predictions with known labels.",
