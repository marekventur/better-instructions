  "input": "spinach, tomatoes, bell peppers, quinoa",
  "output": "This recipe makes a savory and healthy entr\u00e9e. Start by saut\u00e9ing a chopped bell pepper and a diced tomato in olive oil. When the vegetables are softened and beginning to brown, add a cup of washed and drained quinoa, 2 cups of vegetable broth, and a large handful of spinach that\u2019s been rinsed and trimmed. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer until the quinoa has absorbed the liquid, about 15-20 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and serve warm. Enjoy!",
