  "input": "Product: \"Homework Bot\"",
  "output": "The Homework Bot first emerged in the early 2020s when a group of enterprising computer scientists decided to use their skills to revolutionize the way students worked on their homework assignments. \n\nWhen they were first prototyped, the robotic devices were incredibly bulky and expensive. Despite this, the idea of a robotic assistant to help students with their homework quickly caught on and they soon saw massive success in business circles. \n\nOver the next few years, the team dedicated their time and resources to making the technology smaller and more affordable. By 2025, these robots became ubiquitous in student households, helping students finish their work faster, and giving parents more time to spend with their kids. \n\nThe team of inventors have since been heralded as the leading innovators in the field of educational robotics, drastically transforming the way students learn, and making it much easier to achieve educational success.",
