  "output": "Social media has had a significant impact on our daily lives, with platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat shaping the way we communicate, consume news, and interact with each other. In particular, social media has enabled us to connect with others in different parts of the world, create and share content, and receive real-time updates on events happening all over the world. It has also created a new form of entertainment as well as allowed businesses to advertise their products and services more effectively. Furthermore, it has enabled us to get our voices heard in a way that wasn't possible before, leading to greater engagement and understanding between individuals and communities.",
