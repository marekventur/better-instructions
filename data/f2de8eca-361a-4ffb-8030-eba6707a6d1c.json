  "input": "",
  "output": "The causes of friction are the interactions between two surfaces which cause them to resist motion. Ways of decreasing friction include using lubricants and changing the surfaces of the materials in contact with each other. Smooth, hard surfaces generally offer less friction than uneven, soft materials.",
