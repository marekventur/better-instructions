  "output": "Product A has a 10-year lifespan, while Product B has a 20-year lifespan. Product A would require more frequent repairs and replacements, whereas Product B would require fewer repairs and replacements over its lifespan. Product A is likely to be cheaper upfront than Product B, but Product B would have a lower cost of ownership in the long run.",
