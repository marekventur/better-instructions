  "output": "Alice was walking through the woods when she stumbled upon a small clearing. In the center was a wood-elf, who had a twinkle in her eyes and seemed to be in a trance. She had wild, curly hair and wore a long, flowing blue dress that seemed to sparkle. \nAlice cautiously approached the elf, who opened her eyes and smiled at her. \"Greetings, Alice,\" the elf said in a soft voice. \"I am Imogen, a magical creature who has been living in these woods for centuries. I am here to grant a wish to those who deserve it.\"\n\nAlice was transfixed. She wondered what wish she could make that could possibly be granted by a magical creature. The elf seemed to sense her thoughts and assured her that anything she desired was possible. \nAlice thought for a moment, then decided that she wanted to have the power to make positive change in the world. Imogen smiled and waved her wand, and before she knew it, Alice was filled with an unexplainable power. \n\nAlice thanked Imogen, and together they walked through the forest until they reached the edge of the clearing. The elf encouraged Alice to use her newfound power to help those in need, then vanished into the trees.\n\nAlice walked on, feeling the strength of the power inside her, and was filled with joy at the thought of the good she could do with it.",
