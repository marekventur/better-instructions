  "instruction": "Describe the impacts of climate change on communities living in coastal areas.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change has caused an increase in sea levels, which has caused coastal erosion and flooding of low-lying areas. This has led to displacement of people from their homes, as well as increased risk of epidemics of waterborne illnesses. Coastal cities have also seen an increase in extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tropical storms, which can cause extensive damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses. As a result of climate change, some coastal areas are becoming uninhabitable, forcing communities to seek alternative living arrangements.",
