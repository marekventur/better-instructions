  "output": "An example of a classic fairy tale with a lesson is The Goose with the Golden Eggs. In this story, a farmer finds a goose that lays golden eggs. The farmer gets impatient and kills the goose to get all of the eggs at once, only to find that the goose is unprofitable without its ability to lay the golden eggs. This fairy tale teaches the lesson that patience is a virtue and that one should not sacrifice long term gains for short term gratification.",
