  "output": "Cash flow is the net amount of cash that is being moved in and out of a business or individual. It is the measure of money being received and spent during a specific period of time. Positive cash flow indicates that the residual money after all expenses and liabilities is greater than zero, while negative cash flow indicates that there is more money going out than coming in. The cash flow of a business or individual can be assessed through cash flow statements.",
