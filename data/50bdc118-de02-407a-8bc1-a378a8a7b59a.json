  "instruction": "Identify a customer segment for a new product",
  "input": "Product: Frozen food for students",
  "output": "The customer segment for the frozen food product could be college and university students. These customers have limited time and resources that makes cooking difficult. Therefore, providing them a convenient and affordable alternative is likely to be well-received. Furthermore, since the frozen food is targeted at students, you could promote it at campuses and engage in more effective word-of-mouth marketing.",
