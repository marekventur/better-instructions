  "output": "Organizing a scavenger hunt or a geocaching game in a nearby park would be a fun and unique outdoor activity. It is not too difficult to organize, either. You could split participants into teams, assign tasks, set a time limit, and prepare some maps and clues. This can be played solo or as part of a group. In addition, depending on the size of the group, you can involve a group of facilitators to keep things organized and safe.",
