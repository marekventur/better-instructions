  "output": "A volcano is an opening on the Earth's surface that allows molten rock, ash and gases to escape from below the surface. Volcanoes are caused by movement of the Earth\u2019s tectonic plates and are usually found at plate boundaries. Most volcanoes are cone-shaped mountains that form when lava and other materials erupt from a volcano's vent. Eruptions vary in size, from occasional effusive eruptions, to large explosive eruptions that can send ash and gas high into the atmosphere.",
