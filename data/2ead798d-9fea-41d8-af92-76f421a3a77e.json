  "input": "",
  "output": "Amy was a young girl who found herself faced with a difficult decision. At school, she had the opportunity to pursue a field of study she was passionate about, but her parents were strongly against it. They wanted her to stay within their comfort zone and understand her limitations, but deep down Amy knew she wanted to take a chance and take the risk. In the end, she made the difficult decision to break away from her parents\u2019 expectations and follow her heart. Despite the fear, she never regretted her path and ultimately found the courage to keep pursuing her dream.",
