  "input": "def fizz_buzz(n):\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:\n            print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n        elif i % 3 == 0:\n            print(\"Fizz\")\n        elif i % 5 == 0:\n            print(\"Buzz\")\n        else:\n            print(i)",
  "output": "The function 'fizz_buzz' takes in a number n as the input and prints out all numbers from 1 to n, but when a number is a multiple of 3, it prints \"Fizz\"; when the number is a multiple of 5, it prints \"Buzz\"; when the number is both a multiple of 3 and 5, it prints \"FizzBuzz\". The output of this code would be a sequence of numbers from 1 to n with the substitution according to the criteria described above. For example, if n = 15, the output would be 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz.",
