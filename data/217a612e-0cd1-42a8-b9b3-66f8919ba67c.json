  "output": "My new time management system for working professionals is designed to help people make the most of their time. It focuses on strategically scheduling tasks, prioritizing tasks based on importance and deadlines, delegating tasks in order to streamline workloads, taking breaks, and reflecting on goals and progress. This system also encourages working professionals to create a daily plan that focuses on their most important tasks, break down long-term projects into smaller, manageable tasks, and set a realistic timeline for completing each task. This system also encourages professionals to take regular breaks, manage their energy levels, and assess their progress in order to stay on track and remain productive.",
