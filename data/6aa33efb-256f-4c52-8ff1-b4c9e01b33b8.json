  "output": "A successful triathlon training plan should focus on proper technique for swimming, running, and cycling. A sample program would involve short aerobic sessions 3 times per week, with a rest day between each session. Longer, more intense workouts should be done at least once per week. Swimming and running should be done at least three times per week, and cycling at least two times. Strength training should also be incorporated twice per week.",
