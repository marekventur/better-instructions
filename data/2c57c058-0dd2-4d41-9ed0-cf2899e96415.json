  "instruction": "Create a system for tracking electronic device usage.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The system will track the usage of electronic devices for each user. For each device type, it will record how much time the device is used in a day. The device types include computers, laptops, tablets, and cell phones. Each record should include the date, name of the device user, the type of device being used, the time the device was used and the duration of its usage in minutes. \nThe system should also create an alert when a user exceeds the maximum allowed time to use any device during a given day. The alert should pop up on the user\u2019s device, with a reminder to take a break from the device.",
