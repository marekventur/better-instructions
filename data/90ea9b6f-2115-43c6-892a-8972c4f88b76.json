  "input": "",
  "output": "A recently published study has revealed how dolphins use echolocation and complex sound signals to communicate over long distances. By studying the sound waves that the dolphins make, researchers were able to identify one type of signal as \"burst pulses\" which are brief, high-pitched vocalisations used for communication. The research also showed that the dolphins alter the sound waves to create \"symmetric mega-bubbles\" in the water which can reflect sounds to specific locations and even cause background noise to be muffled. This suggests that dolphins have a highly evolved communication system which allows them to effectively talk with each other despite the interference of background noise.",
