  "input": "",
  "output": "The major social and ethical considerations in artificial intelligence include the implications of artificially intelligent bots on the job market and the potential misuse of AI technology. Additionally, questions of privacy and autonomy are important ethical issues and measures must be taken to protect individuals' privacy. AI also has implications on inequality, as AI technologies can potentially create biased decision-making processes that reinforce existing power dynamics. Furthermore, precautions must be taken to ensure AI systems are not improperly manipulating or influencing people.",
