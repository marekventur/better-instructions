  "output": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been likened to a world war, with everyone affected in some way by its impacts of social distancing and financial strain. Just like the world wars of the twentieth century, it has caused disruption on a global level, with nations and individuals alike forced to alter the way they live and interact. It has been an enormously costly and difficult situation for many, and it seems that the only thing we can do is to stay strong, continue to mask up, distance and look ahead to a future free of the virus.",
