  "input": "This is a collection of tweets from a Twitter handle @sarcastic_tweets.\n\nTweet_1: What a beautiful day!\nTweet_2: So glad I have to work on a Saturday\nTweet_3: My cat is so cute when he sleeps",
  "output": "Model is trained to assign a score between 0 and 1 to each tweet, indicating the probability for the tweet being sarcastic. If the probability is above a certain threshold, then the model classifies the tweet as sarcastic.\nThe model classifies Tweet_2 as sarcastic with a probability of 0.9 and the other two tweets as not sarcastic with a probability of 0.1.",
