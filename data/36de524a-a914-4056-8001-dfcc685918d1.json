  "instruction": "How does the moon affect the tides?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The moon exerts gravitational forces that act on large bodies of water, including oceans, creating gravitational tides. These gravitational tides interact with the circular motion of the Earth and cause ocean levels to rise and fall in a cycle that is roughly aligned with the positions of the sun and moon.",
