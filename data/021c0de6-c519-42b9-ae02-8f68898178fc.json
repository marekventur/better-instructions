  "instruction": "Design a program that simulates an animal's habitat.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The program should create a virtual simulation of an animal's habitat, including data on the environment, animal behavior, and potential threats. To do this, a library of code should be written which contains the data and information needed to realistically simulate the animal\u2019s environment. Additionally, an algorithm should be developed which allows the simulation to represent the animal\u2019s behavior, such as when it eats, sleeps, and reproduces. Furthermore, external factors such as weather and human interaction should be modeled to create a dynamic and realistic representation of the animal\u2019s habitat.",
