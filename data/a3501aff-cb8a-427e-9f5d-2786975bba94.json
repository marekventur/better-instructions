  "input": "",
  "output": "Scientists have reported a sharp rise in the world's ocean temperatures over the past few decades due to climate change. There has been a 0.13\u00b0C increase in the world's oceans since the 1950s, with the majority of oceanic warming happening near the sea surface. This is leading to changes in the world's climate, threatening many ecosystems, and could cause a shift in regional weather patterns. The long-term effects of this increase in oceanic temperature are not yet known.",
