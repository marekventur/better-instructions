  "input": "",
  "output": "Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the complexity of an algorithm. It describes the upper bound on the number of operations done by the algorithm and is used to describe the execution time of an algorithm and its space requirements. The basic idea is to express the time or space of the algorithm in terms of an upper bound which is related to the input size, usually represented as \u201cN\u201d.",
