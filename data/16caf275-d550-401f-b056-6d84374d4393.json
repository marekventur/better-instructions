  "instruction": "What type of design pattern would you apply in the following situation?",
  "input": "You have to design an algorithm to find the best route from one place to another.",
  "output": "I would apply a greedy algorithm as it can quickly find the path with the shortest distance between two locations. Greedy algorithms are efficient, and this algorithm is a good fit for the problem because it can quickly identify the best possible route between two points.",
