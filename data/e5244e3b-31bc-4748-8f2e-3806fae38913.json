  "input": "",
  "output": "If I had $10,000 to invest in a startup, I would choose a digital media services business. Digital media services provide businesses with the expertise and tools to reach potential customers on digital platforms. This includes the production of content, web design, marketing, and social media management. Such businesses can be very successful, as they are able to effectively reach and engage their target audiences, driving traffic and sales. Furthermore, the start-up costs of such a business are relatively low and it can easily scale up as demand increases. As such, I believe a digital media services business would be a great investment.",
