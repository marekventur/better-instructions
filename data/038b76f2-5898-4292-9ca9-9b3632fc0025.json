  "output": "To fold a shirt, start by laying the shirt flat and smoothing out any wrinkles. Then, fold the sleeves inside so the sides of the shirt lay flat, followed by folding the shirt in half lengthwise. Next, fold the bottom edge up to the midpoint of the shirt, and then fold the top edge down to meet the bottom edge. Finally, fold the shirt in half again and tuck the sleeves into the packet.",
