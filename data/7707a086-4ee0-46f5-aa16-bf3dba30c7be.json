  "output": "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. It is a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide. Its surface features comprise a heavily cratered terrain, the largest volcano and deepest canyon in the Solar System, and the planet's two frozen polar ice caps. Its red-orange appearance is due to rust in its soil.",
