  "input": "",
  "output": "The three main challenges for the US healthcare system include rising costs, an aging population, and a lack of access to care. \nThe cost of healthcare has risen dramatically in recent years, placing a financial burden on both individuals and families. This has been driven by continuously increasing prices for medicines and treatment, as well as by increasing demand for healthcare services.\nThe US population is aging, meaning more people are living longer, with increasingly complex medical needs. This presents a challenge for the healthcare system, as it needs to equip itself to provide ever-more specialized care to an increasingly diverse population.\nFinally, access to health care remains an issue in the US. Income-based disparities in health insurance coverage serve to create a \u2018two-tier\u2019 health system, where those from lower-income backgrounds receive fewer resources and poorer care.",
