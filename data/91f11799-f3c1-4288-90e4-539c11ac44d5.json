  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a magical being who was disliked by everyone. Her name was Grace and she had many gifts, including the ability to talk to animals, control the weather and sense danger. \n\nBut these gifts were not seen as a blessing; instead, the people of the kingdom feared her and did everything they could to keep her away. They spread rumors about her, spread tales of her being a witch and gossiped about her wherever she went.\n\nThe people did not understand her and mistreated her, no matter how hard she tried to fit in. They would not listen to her stories about talking to animals and riding the wind, and would not accept her warnings of imminent danger. \n\nNobody wanted Grace around, but she stayed and kept her powers hidden, until one day something changed. A stranger arrived at the kingdom and asked to meet with Grace, revealing extraordinary news. It turns out she was the missing princess of the kingdom and everyone was disgraced. \n\nThe people quickly acknowledged her as their rightful ruler, and the magical and misunderstood being soon became the beloved ruler of the kingdom.",
