  "input": "",
  "output": "A polynomial is an expression that involves operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and non-negative integer exponents of variables. A polynomial is composed of terms, which are separated by plus and minus signs. Each term includes a coefficient (a number), a literal part (a letter or symbol representing a value), and an exponent (which indicates how many times the literal is used). For example, the expression 4x^3 + 6x + 9x^2 contains three terms and represents a 3-degree polynomial. Polynomials can be used to model many types of functions and equations in mathematics, science, and engineering.",
