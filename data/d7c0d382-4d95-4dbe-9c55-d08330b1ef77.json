  "output": "Coffee has a number of amazing benefits that many people overlook. For starters, it's full of antioxidants that help to protect our cells from free radicals which can cause premature aging and cellular damage. Coffee has also been linked to reducing the risk of stroke, diabetes, and even certain types of cancer. It can also help to improve cognitive function and alertness, particularly when it's consumed in moderation. Furthermore, coffee increases our energy levels and can help us to stay on task throughout the day. Lastly, coffee has been shown to have an antianxiety effect on those who consume it regularly. Clearly, coffee is a drink that has far more benefits than many people realize.",
