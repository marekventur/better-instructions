  "output": "The most effective way to learn a new language is to immerse yourself in it. This means spending time with people who speak the language, watching movies and TV shows in the language, and reading books or other written material. Additionally, actively using the language is the best way to learn - find conversation partners to practice with or join a language exchange program. Finally, take advantage of digital language learning tools, such as apps or online courses, to supplement your learning.",
