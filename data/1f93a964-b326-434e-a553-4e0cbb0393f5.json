  "input": "",
  "output": "Facial recognition algorithms identify and analyze facial features from an image of a face. The algorithms use techniques derived from both computer vision and machine learning to identify a face, or compare faces to each other. This technology typically breaks down the facial recognition process into stages, such as detecting and aligning faces, extracting facial features, comparing the facial features to a database, and generating a match score. The applications of facial recognition algorithms range from security to automatic check-in, and have seen a huge growth in recent years due to the advancements of deep learning.",
