  "instruction": "Write two paragraphs describing the differences between two products",
  "input": "Product A: Kindles\nProduct B: iPads",
  "output": "Product A: Kindles are lightweight, compact devices designed for reading and storing books and magazines. They offer access to the Amazon Kindle store, giving users access to millions of books and periodicals. They also feature a long-lasting battery life for extended reading, as well as access to audio books.\n\nProduct B: iPads are multi-functional devices with a larger screen than a Kindle, enabling users to read, watch movies and shows, play games, and more. They also feature powerful processors and an intuitive user interface, allowing users to quickly switch between apps and tasks. They also offer access to a number of different stores and streaming services, as well as a variety of productivity apps.\n\nThe main difference between Kindles and iPads is the purpose. A Kindle is designed primarily for reading, while an iPad is designed to be a more versatile device for a range of activities. Additionally, the pricing for Kindles is generally lower than for iPads, making them a cost-effective option for reading.",
