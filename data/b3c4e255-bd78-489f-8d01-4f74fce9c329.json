  "output": "Mozart's Sonata in A major K331 is an example of a sonata-style composition written in the classical period. It has three movements - Allegro, Andante grazioso, and Alla Turca - and is composed of a variety of textures ranging from lyrical, melodic passages to virtuosic, ornate figuration. The piece is often described as having a Hungarian-influenced style and begins with a heroic theme. The Andante also stands out for its beautiful, lyrical melodies. The last movement is a lively and exciting rondo, transitioning from a virtuosic to a more charming and joyful texture. Overall, the piece provides an impressive development of musical material, combining a variety of textures, themes, and elements within a relatively short piece.",
