  "input": "\"Growth is painful. Change is painful. But, nothing is as painful as staying stuck somewhere you don't belong.\"",
  "output": "This quote is about the difficulty and pain of leaving one\u2019s comfort zone and taking on a new challenge. The underlying message is that although it can be uncomfortable and difficult, change and growth is necessary to reach higher goals and to reach our true potential. It is a reminder that living the same way, doing the same things and staying in the same situations that may feel comfortable in the short-term is not truly living, and will ultimately lead to an unfulfilled life.",
