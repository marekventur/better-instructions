  "input": "",
  "output": "A mobile application is a software program designed specifically for use on a smartphone or tablet, while a responsive website is designed to work on multiple devices of different sizes. A mobile app is usually optimized for the device it is designed for, and is usually more user friendly and provides a better experience than a responsive website. Additionally, mobile apps can use the device's features, such as the camera and microphone, while a website cannot.",
