  "output": "Auroras are beautiful lights seen in the night sky in places near the Earth's magnetic poles. They are caused by particles in solar winds, ejected from the Sun, that collide with the Earth's atmosphere. The particles collide with the atoms and molecules of the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light show of different colors in the sky.",
