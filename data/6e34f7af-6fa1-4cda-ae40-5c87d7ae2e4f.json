  "input": "",
  "output": "A text-based user interface, or TUI, is a type of user interface where users interact with a computer terminal using typed commands. TUIs allow users to interact with a computer without access to a graphical user interface (GUI). TUIs typically use a combination of text prompts, menus and enterable commands to provide users with a way to control the computer\u2019s functions and execute programs. TUIs are commonly used in command-line interfaces where users can type in commands or parameters to do something specific, such as starting a program, copying a file or opening a web page.",
