  "output": "Once upon a time there was a family that had a small pet bird that they absolutely adored. Every day, they would take the bird out of its tiny cage and set it on a plate on the table. They would marvel as the bird basked in the sunlight and soaked in the attention of its human family. \n\nEvery morning, the family would rise and prepare a delectable assortment of fruits and seeds for their tiny treasure. They would fill the plate to the brim with their creation, and the bird would joyously peck away at its meal. As the day passed, the family would take pride in how much their pet had grown.\n\nThe bird was a blessing for the family; it became a symbol of hope and joy for them. However, as time slowly passed, nothing remains the same. \n\nA few years later, the tiny pet was growing old, and it was slowly becoming more frail. But it still held onto the same pride that it had had when it was young. On its last day, the family brought out the same small plate and filled it with its favorite food.\n\nThe bird quietly passed away that day, but the family was still proud of the time they had spent with their beloved pet. The words \u201cplate\u201d and \u201cproud\u201d became firmly entrenched in the families\u2019 way of life, as they would always be reminded of their little friend every time they looked at the plate on their table.",
