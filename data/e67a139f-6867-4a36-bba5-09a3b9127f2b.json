  "output": "It was a beautiful day at the zoo, the sun was shining bright and the animals were all out. Ryan, an eight year old boy, had been eagerly awaiting this day as it was his first time visiting the zoo. He had heard stories of how the animals were so close you could touch them, but he had never believed it until this day. Ryan sprinted to the nearest tiger enclosure, the magnificent beast was pacing back and forth in its cage. He watched in amazement as the tiger let out a deep roar which echoed through the zoo grounds. Ryan moved on to the giraffe enclosure, there he could get even closer to these majestic creatures. He watched in awe as they gracefully moved around the enclosure. Ryan continued his day exploring the rest of the zoo, marveling at the diversity of the creatures around him.",
