  "input": "",
  "output": "Turtles are a keystone species that play an important role in maintaining the balance of an ecosystem. They help feed other species by providing food through their waste or through the plant matter they consume. They also provide shelter for many species, including amphibians, fish, and insects. Additionally, they control algae growth, which helps keep an aquatic ecosystem in balance. Finally, they act as a form of pest control, as they prey on invasive species that could harm other species.",
