  "instruction": "Construct a system of equations to solve the following problem.",
  "input": "A store sells sandwiches and drinks. There are 6 sandwiches and 5 drinks. Each sandwich costs $3 and each drink costs $2. The total cost is $21.",
  "output": "Let x be the number of sandwiches, and y be the number of drinks. The equation for the total cost can be written as 3x + 2y = 21. To find the number of sandwiches and drinks, we can use the equation x + y = 11, since there are a total of 11 items. Combining these equations, we can get 3x + 2x = 21 and 5x = 21, so x = 4 and y = 7. Therefore, there are 4 sandwiches and 7 drinks, for a total cost of $21.",
