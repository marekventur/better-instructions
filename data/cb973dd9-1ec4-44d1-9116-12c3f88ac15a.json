  "input": "",
  "output": "In the future, the world is a dystopian nightmare. People live in oppressive cities with little access to nature, the air is polluted, and food is scarce. Resources are concentrated in the hands of the few while the majority of people toil away in poverty and struggle to survive. Technology is everywhere, but it is used to further oppress the poor, while the rich use it to perpetuate their power. \n\nThe government is authoritarian, surveillance is rampant, and people have little choice in how they live their lives. Education and healthcare are only available to the privileged few, while the basic necessities of life are out of reach for many. Corruption and inequality are pervasive and a lack of trust has broken down communities. It is a future that is dystopian, fearful, and uncertain.",
