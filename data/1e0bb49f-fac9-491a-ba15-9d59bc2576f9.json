Compare the number of items in each category to find the items with the least number of items.\n3. Estimate the average time it takes to check out each item based on the type of item.\n4. Calculate the total time it would take to check out a single item.\n5. Rank the items according to the total time it would take to check out each item.\n6. Select the item with the lowest time.",
