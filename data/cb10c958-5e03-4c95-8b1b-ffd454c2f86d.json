  "output": "This pirate is a tall, muscular man with an eye patch and a long, braided beard. He wears a frayed red bandana, tattered trousers, and a tarnished brass belt buckle. He carries two swords at his side, and his ship is his prized possession. He is a daring, ruthless captain who commands respect from his crew and fear from his enemies. He is driven by his ambitions and his need for adventure, and nothing can get in his way from achieving his goals.",
