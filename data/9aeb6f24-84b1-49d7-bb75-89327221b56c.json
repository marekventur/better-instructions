  "input": "",
  "output": "Abstract art is a form of art that focuses on shapes, lines, and color, rather than creating a figurative representation of an object. The art relies on the composition, balance, pattern, and witty use of contrasting colors to create feelings and emotions in the viewer. Abstract art usually leaves interpretations up to the viewer, while other art forms may be more concrete in their meaning.",
