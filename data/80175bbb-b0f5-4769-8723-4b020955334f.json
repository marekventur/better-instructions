  "input": "",
  "output": "SSL/TLS is a protocol used to protect data in transit between two systems, while HTTPS is the application layer protocol primarily used to securely transmit data over the internet. SSL/TLS is responsible for establishing the secure connection between two systems, and for encrypting the data that is exchanged. HTTPS, on the other hand, is responsible for maintaining the secure connection and for validating the website's identity to the browser. In addition, HTTPS provides authentication that the website a user is visiting is trustworthy and legitimate.",
