Due to personal circumstances, I haven't been able to dedicate as much time and focus to this course as I had hoped. I am confident that with a bit more time, I will be able to complete the assignment to the best of my abilities.\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you could grant me an extension of 1 week. I understand if this is not possible and I am happy to discuss other alternatives.\n \nThank you for your time,\n[Name]",
