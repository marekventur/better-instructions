  "input": "<no input>",
  "output": "Donating old books to a library is an excellent way to recycle them and help the community. Libraries not only make books available for people to borrow and enjoy, but they also often use the proceeds from book donations to purchase new supplies and keep their collections up to date. Furthermore, donating books helps to reduce landfill waste, as many books that are not sold to recycling centers end up in landfills.",
