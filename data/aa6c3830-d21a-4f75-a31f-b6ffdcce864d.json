  "output": "John was a good father and did his best to ensure his son, Evan, was safe and happy. But one day, John overheard Evan talking to his friends in hushed tones, and occasionally he could hear snippets of their conversations. Evan sounded tense and agitated, and he was often tearful.\n\nSuspecting something was wrong, John asked his son to tell him what was happening, and Evan reluctantly confessed that he was being cyberbullied. John was horrified. He remembered how he had been bullied mercilessly at school as a child, long before the time of computers and smartphones.\n\nJohn took the steps necessary to protect his son, including blocking the bullies from having any contact with Evan online. He also taught him how to deal with the bullies and set him up with a counselor to help him process his feelings and come to terms with his experiences. \n\nJohn promised Evan that he was there for him and would listen anytime he felt vulnerable or scared. He was determined to make sure his son never felt alone again, and to teach him to never be ashamed of asking for help.",
