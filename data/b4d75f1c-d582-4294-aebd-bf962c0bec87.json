  "output": "I recently saw someone do something incredibly generous. I was on a bus with a group of people when a man offered to pay for everyone's fare. This was a huge surprise and everyone was so grateful. He said he wanted to spread a little kindness in an otherwise stressful world. It was a really beautiful thing to witness and I'm still thinking about it days after it happened.",
