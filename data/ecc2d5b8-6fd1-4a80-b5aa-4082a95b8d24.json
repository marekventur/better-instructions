  "input": "",
  "output": "Ecological services, also referred to as ecosystem services, are the benefits to human populations provided by natural ecosystems. These services can include traditional resources such as clean water, timber, and seafood, but also more intangible benefits such as flood control, aesthetic value, climate regulation, and health and recreational benefits. By maintaining or restoring healthy functioning ecosystems and the associated biodiversity, ecological services can be conserved or even enhanced. Healthy functioning ecosystems have the potential to provide increased food sources, better water quality, improved soil fertility, and greater pest control, all of which are important for supporting biodiversity. In addition, ecological processes such as regulation of water flow, water retention, and nutrient cycling are integral processes in maintaining biological diversity. Ultimately, preserving and restoring ecological services will enhance global biodiversity.",
