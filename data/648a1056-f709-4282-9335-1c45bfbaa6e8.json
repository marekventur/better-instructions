  "output": "One example of a problem that artificial intelligence can solve is fraud detection. AI can be used to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions by analyzing data and identifying patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity. AI can also be used to detect fraud in complex areas such as insurance claims and online purchases. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data mining techniques, AI systems can detect fraudulent activities in real-time and provide alerts to the appropriate authorities. This allows businesses to take swift and accurate action in order to protect their customers and assets from fraudulent activities.",
