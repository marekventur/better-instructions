  "output": "The beer brewing process typically consists of the following steps: malting, mashing, lautering, boiling, cooling, fermentation, and packaging. Malting involves germinating barley grains and activating enzymes to break down starch. Mashing converts malt starches into sugars. Lautering is a filtration process that separates the extract from the grains. Boiling sterilizes the beer and removes unwanted bacteria. Cooling prepares the beer for fermentation. Fermentation is a biological process which converts sugars into alcohol. Packaging involves bottling, canning, or kegging the beer.",
