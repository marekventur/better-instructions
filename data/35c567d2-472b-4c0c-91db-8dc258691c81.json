  "instruction": "Elaborate on why students should get involved in their school communities.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Students should get involved in their school communities because it helps to foster a sense of belonging, develop leadership skills, and teach accountability. By being connected to the school, students are more likely to feel like they are part of something bigger. This can lead to increased engagement in their academic work, as they are more invested in their school's success. Additionally, getting involved can help students develop important leadership skills, such as cooperation, communication, and problem-solving. Finally, being involved in school activities can give students a greater sense of accountability, as they take on more responsibilities at the school.",
