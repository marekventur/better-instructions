  "instruction": "Find out and explain the cause of the given natural disaster.",
  "input": "Tornado",
  "output": "Tornadoes are caused by a combination of factors, including warm, moist air near the Earth\u2019s surface and cold, dry air higher up in the atmosphere. Together, these two forces create a strong updraft of air, which rapidly begins to rotate and intensifies as it moves. This upward and rotating air causes the formation of a funnel-shaped cloud, known as a tornado.",
