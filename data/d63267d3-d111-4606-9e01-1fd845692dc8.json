  "input": "Bookshelves are full and disorganized.",
  "output": "An effective strategy for organizing bookshelves is to begin by sorting the books by type (fiction, non-fiction, textbooks, etc.). Next, within each type, sort into categories based on the subject matter (mysteries, biographies, mathematics, etc.). Finally, within each category, arrange the books in alphabetical order by author's last name. This will help you easily locate any book and keep the bookshelf neat and organized.",
