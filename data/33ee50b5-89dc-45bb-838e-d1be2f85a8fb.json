They\u2019re both looking a bit lost, but they\u2019re holding hands, a sign that they\u2019re together and that they\u2019ll make it through.\n\nREBECCA\nIt\u2019s getting late. I think our flight leaves in a few minutes.\n\nJACOB\nI know. I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t have more time.\n\nRebecca smiles and gives his hand a squeeze. \n\nREBECCA\nIt\u2019s alright. We\u2019ll make it.\n\nThey continue walking for a few moments before they spot their gate and hurry towards it. \n\nREBECCA (CONT'D)\nThere it is.\n\nThey get to the gate and the gate agent ushers them in to board the plane. They take their seats, both of them a bit tired, but still ready to take on the world.\n\nJACOB\nReady? \n\nREBECCA\nYeah. Let\u2019s go.",
