She always wanted to ride a horse, but she was too afraid to ask for help.\n\nOne day, she stumbled upon a white horse in the forest and she finally had the courage to ask for help. An old man appeared and said, \"If you want to ride the horse, you must accept the risks that come with it.\"\n\nThe girl was scared but she gathered her courage and accepted his offer. The old man instructed her on how to ride the horse and she finally did it.\n\nThe moral of the story is that you should never be afraid to take risks in life. While it may not always work out, if you are brave and accept the risks you can end up with a wonderful reward.",
