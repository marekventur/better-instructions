  "input": "",
  "output": "An engaging way to teach children about animals would be to use arts and crafts. For example, they could cut out different shapes (such as circles, stars, and hearts) to make pictures of the animals they are learning about, or they can make a collage of pictures of animals found in different habitats. You can also make games out of a piece of paper and a die \u2013 have the child roll the die, and for every number, have them tell you something about the animal that corresponds with the number. For example, if the die lands on 6, you could have them tell you 6 facts about elephants.",
