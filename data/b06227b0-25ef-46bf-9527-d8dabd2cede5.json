  "input": "",
  "output": "The program should use natural language processing to detect offensive or abusive language by analyzing the context and semantic meaning of words or phrases. It should have the capability to flag inappropriate content and alert the moderators of the forum. Additionally, it should also have the capability to detect nuanced language and identify more subtle forms of offensive language, such as sarcasm and coded language.",
