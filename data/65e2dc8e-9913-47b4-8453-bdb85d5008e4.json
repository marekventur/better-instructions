  "output": "A common misconception about the space industry is that it is a \u201czero-sum game.\u201d That is, it is perceived as a purely competitive industry, in which success or failure is determined by who captures the larger market share. However, this is far from the truth. In reality, the space industry is comprised of many different companies and organizations working together, leveraging the strengths of each to achieve common goals. Also, the space industry is highly collaborative and creative, developing novel technologies and services to enable humanity's exploration of space.",
