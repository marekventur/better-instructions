  "output": "In his book Utopia for Realists, Rutger Bregman presents an argument for a guaranteed universal basic income, a fifteen-hour workweek, and open borders. He argues that implementing these measures can reduce inequality, create more free time, increase economic growth, and enhance social and personal well-being. He also details how these principles, in the form of successful experiments, have already begun to be enacted in some parts of the world.",
