  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce global warming is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and increase our usage of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy. Additionally, improving energy efficiency, investing in carbon offsets, and planting trees can also help mitigate the effects of climate change. Finally, changing our everyday habits can also have a large impact on reducing global warming, such as reducing waste, biking, walking or public transit instead of driving, and eating less red meat.",
