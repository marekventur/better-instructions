  "output": "Making chocolate chip cookies is a simple but rewarding process. To begin, preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. In a mixing bowl, mix together 1 cup of softened butter and 1 cup of granulated sugar. Beat in 2 large eggs, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. Slowly stir in 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour until the dough is evenly mixed. Finally, fold in 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. \n\nScoop the cookie dough onto the lined baking sheets and bake for 10-12 minutes. Once the cookies are golden brown, let them cool for 10 minutes before enjoying.",
