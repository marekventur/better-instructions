  "output": "The development of the printing press began with Johannes Gutenberg in the 1440s. He created a movable type machine that allowed for faster and more efficient printing than before. The invention of the printing press had a major impact on communication and knowledge, as printed material could reach a larger number of people than ever before. It also allowed for the replication of books, and the standardization of language and literature.",
