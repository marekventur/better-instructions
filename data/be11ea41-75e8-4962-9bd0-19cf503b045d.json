  "input": "",
  "output": "My idea for a self-driving car is to develop an AI system that uses machine learning to help the car recognize its environment. The AI system will also be able to learn from its mistakes and increase its accuracy. Additionally, the self-driving car will be able to detect potential hazards and warn the driver, or take corrective action if necessary. The car will also be equipped with an emergency button, in case the driver needs to take manual control of the vehicle. Furthermore, the car will be capable of automated parking and will be able to drive itself to a nearby charging station when the battery is low. Finally, the software will be able to connect with smartphones, so the user can access their navigation system and entertainment options even while on the move.",
