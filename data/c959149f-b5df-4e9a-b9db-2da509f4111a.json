He had always wanted to be a knight, but he never felt he was good enough, so he was content with being an everyday person. But one day, he found out that an evil wizard was planning to enslave the people of the kingdom. Even though he was scared, he knew he must do something to save them all. So, he set off on a quest to find the wizard and defeat him.\n\nWith courage and determination, Peter was able to pass through a series of trials and tests that the wizard had put in his way.
