  "input": "",
  "output": "Introverts are usually introspective, quiet, and prefer to spend time alone. They may be seen as thoughtful and creative, but are often shy and uncomfortable in social situations. Introverts are inclined to listen more than they talk and take time to think before responding when speaking with others. They tend to focus on the internal world of their own thoughts and feelings and may not understand the need for small talk.",
