  "output": "To perform the experiment, I would need a beaker, hot plate, metal scoop and chalk powder. First, I would measure 200 grams of chalk powder and pour it into the beaker. Then, I would heat the beaker on the hot plate for 15 minutes. Finally, I would use the metal scoop to carefully remove the chalk from the beaker, and observe the effects. To evaluate the results, I would record the weight, temperature and appearance of the chalk.",
