  "input": "Two people: 80 year old grandparent, 18 year old grandchild\nActivity: Baking",
  "output": "The 80 year old grandparent and 18 year old grandchild were looking for a way to bond. One day, the grandparent suggested they bake something together. Even though they had never baked before, they worked together to create a delicious cake. As they measured out the ingredients, the grandparent shared stories from their childhood, and the grandchild was fascinated to hear about what life was like back then. As they prepared the cake, both were filled with a sense of pride as it came out of the oven perfectly. They then celebrated with some tea and a generous slice of cake. The moment was truly special for both of them.",
