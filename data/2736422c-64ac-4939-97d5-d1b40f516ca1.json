  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to extend the lifecycle of a battery is to make sure that it is kept at a consistent temperature. Keeping the battery in a cool place where the temperature does not fluctuate can help decrease degradation. Also, try to only use the battery when it is at full power or close to full power. Avoid often draining the battery to low levels, as this can shorten its lifespan. Additionally, it is important to keep any contacts clean and free from dust, as this can reduce electrical resistance and reduce the amount of power used.",
