  "input": "",
  "output": "The species is bipedal, with a long and lean body, small limbs, and two large black eyes set in a human-like head. Its skin is smooth and gray, and it has two long antennae on its forehead. It communicates through a high-pitched trill, and is able to adapt to different environments. For example, it can breathe and survive in high pressure, as well as lower-pressure regions. Physically, the alien species is incredibly strong, and has a heightened sense of smell and hearing. Despite its intimidating appearance and strength, it is known for its peaceful and calm nature.",
