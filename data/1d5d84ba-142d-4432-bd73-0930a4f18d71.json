  "input": "\"Death is not the greatest loss, the greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.\" - Norman Cousins",
  "output": "This quote emphasizes that death is not the greatest grief we can experience. Rather, it is the things that die within us while we are alive, such as our hopes and dreams, our spirit, our courage, our openness to love and life, that can be even more devastating. Our willingness to experience life in full and to fully express ourselves is something we must hold onto and nurture over the course of a lifetime.",
