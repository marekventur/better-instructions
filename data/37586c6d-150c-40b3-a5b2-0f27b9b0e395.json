  "output": "Verse 1:\nWhen I look out my window, uncertainty stares back\nThe world is a mystery and the future is a never ending lack\nOh, what lies ahead for me, let its secrets reveal\nTaking each step with caution, I'll follow the path of life\n\nChorus:\nThe path of life, I'm mapping my way\nThe path of life, I'm ready to take it one day at a time\nThe path of life, I'm walking still\nThe path of life, I know it's leading me right\n\nVerse 2:\nLooking ahead, there's hope in my heart\nFacing the fear, I'm ready to start\nMy faith will carry me through this winding road\nMy strength will be renewed, I'm never alone\n\nChorus:\nThe path of life, I'm mapping my way\nThe path of life, I'm ready to take it one day at a time\nThe path of life, I'm walking still\nThe path of life, I know it's leading me right\n\nBridge:\nA bright sky guides my way, what's in store I'm ready to face\nThe curves and turns ahead will help shape my destiny\n\nChorus:\nThe path of life, I'm mapping my way\nThe path of life, I'm ready to take it one day at a time\nThe path of life, I'm walking still\nThe path of life, I know it's leading me right",
