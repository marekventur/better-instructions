  "input": "Prompt:\nIt had been days since she had seen the mysterious figure in the forest.",
  "output": "She had been living in the small village for many years, but had never seen anything quite like the mysterious figure in the woods. She had glimpsed it several times, but never long enough to get a good look. She had never bothered to mention it to anyone out of fear of not being believed - today, however, she decided to take a chance and go looking for it. She was surprised when she eventually found the creature, but it seemed to recognize her, and after just a few moments, it began to open up to her. She soon learnt of many forgotten secrets and tales, and soon formed a bond with the enigmatic figure. Even after days of searching, she could never have expected what the mysterious figure would teach her.",
