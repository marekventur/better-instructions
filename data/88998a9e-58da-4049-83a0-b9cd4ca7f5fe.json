  "output": "Some of the disadvantages of social media include the potential for cyberbullying, the spread of misinformation, user privacy concerns, and an increase in feelings of loneliness and anxiety. Cyberbullying is a serious problem on social media and can lead to real-world consequences such as depression, self-harm, and even suicide. Misinformation can cause confusion, lead to wrong decisions, and erode trust in information sources. Furthermore, user privacy can be at risk and users can be targeted by advertisers or other malicious actors. Finally, excessive use of social media can lead to feelings of loneliness and anxiety as users compare their lives to the seemingly perfect lives of their peers.",
