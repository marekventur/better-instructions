  "output": "KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by taking a dataset of known classes, finding the K nearest data points to the test data, and then using the most common class among these points as the prediction. KNN is an example of instance-based or lazy learning, where the model does not learn from the data but makes predictions based on similarity measurements such as distance measures between the points. It is simple, effective, and widely used in a variety of applications.",
