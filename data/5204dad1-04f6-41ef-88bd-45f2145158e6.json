  "output": "Machine Learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and make predictions. It works by providing computers with data and algorithms which they can use to identify patterns in the data and then identify cause and effect relationships. This allows the computer to behave in a more 'intelligent' way, by making better predictions, or learning from experience. Machine Learning can be used in a variety of applications such as speech recognition, image recognition, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.",
