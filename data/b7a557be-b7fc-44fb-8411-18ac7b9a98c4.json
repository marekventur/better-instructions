  "output": "Despite the wealth in the richest nation in the world, poverty remains pervasive. Even in the wealthiest countries, there are people who struggle to make ends meet, who are unable to secure adequate housing and healthcare, and who are unable to access adequate educational opportunities. Poverty is a complex issue, but it disproportionately affects women, racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, and other historically marginalized groups.",
