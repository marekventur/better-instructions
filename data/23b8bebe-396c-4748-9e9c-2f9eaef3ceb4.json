  "output": "A method for detecting plagiarism in a text can include comparing the text to a database of known plagiarised works. If the text is found to be a substantial match, it can be flagged as likely plagiarised. Furthermore, the text can be analysed for symbols and common phrases, and the author\u2019s writing style can be checked to determine if it is similar to others. Finally, use of online resources, such as copy-and-paste tools, can be identified by monitoring suspicious activity on webpages.",
