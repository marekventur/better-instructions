  "input": "",
  "output": "1. A volcano is an opening in the Earth\u2019s crust created by molten magma, whereas a geyser is a hole in the Earth\u2019s crust from which hot water and steam will periodically shoot. \n2. Volcanoes usually occur on land, whereas geysers typically exist in more remote regions such as New Zealand and Iceland. \n3. Volcanoes are usually associated with molten lava and ash, while geysers are associated with hot water and steam.",
