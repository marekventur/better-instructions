  "output": "The right to education is a fundamental human right. It is essential for the development of individuals, communities, and societies as a whole. Education provides opportunities for people to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to actively participate in the labor market and to enjoy a better quality of life. A lack of education can lead to poverty, inequality, and exclusion from civic life. It leaves individuals vulnerable to exploitation and can prevent them from asserting their rights. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that everyone has access to free, equitable, and quality education that meets their needs and gives them the opportunity to reach their full potential.",
