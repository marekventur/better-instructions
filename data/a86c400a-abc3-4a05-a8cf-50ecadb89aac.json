  "output": "The parrot sat atop the man's shoulder,\nGazing at the world through all its colors.\n\nThe man polished his shoes and took a deep breath,\nHis heart awash with admiration and respect.\n\nThe parrot squawked and chirped with glee,\nAs if it sensed the affection that the man held for it so dearly.\n\nTheir bond was strong and unwavering,\nThe parrot trust in him never wavering.\n\nThe two were inseparable no matter the weather,\nA relationship that brought the parrot's burdens to lighten and feather. \n\nIt flew with him and saw the world, \nLiving its life singing with confidence and twirled.\n\nThe parrot and the man had come a long way,\nHowever, never trying to drive away.\n\nFor although the parrot's journey was near its end,\nThe man knew that together they'd become friends.",
