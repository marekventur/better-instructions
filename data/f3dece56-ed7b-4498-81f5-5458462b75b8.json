Oxygen is by far the most abundant element, making up 46.6% of the total mass. The other elements account for a total of 53.4%, with silicon the second most abundant element at 28%. Aluminum makes up 8.2% of the crust, followed by iron at 5.6%, calcium at 3.7%, sodium at 2.8%, potassium at 2.6%, and magnesium at 2.1%.",
