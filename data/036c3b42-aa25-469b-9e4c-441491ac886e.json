  "output": "Once upon a time there was a witch who had a magical broom. This broom was special because it allowed the witch to fly anywhere she wanted, and it never got tired. Even if it flew for days on end, it would still be ready to fly again the next day.\n\nThe witch used the broom to travel to places near and far and do whatever she wanted. She'd fly through forests and over mountains, visiting quaint towns and bustling cities. Everywhere she flew, she saw something new and exciting.\n\nBut the witch was very careful with her broom. She knew that if it ever broke she'd be powerless and unable to go anywhere. So she kept it well-maintained and always handled it with care.\n\nThe witch and her magical broom continued to explore the world together for many years, until eventually the broom got too old and worn. The witch said goodbye to her beloved broom and commissioned a new one, continuing her travels and adventures.",
