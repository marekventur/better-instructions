  "input": "",
  "output": "Nestled between the rolling hills and the blue horizon of the Pacific ocean, lies a small coastal town. Its inhabitants are warm and friendly, and they are pioneers in preserving the marine environment. The town is surrounded by tranquil beaches and tall pine trees, with fishing boats bobbing on the bay. Wildlife flourishes in the nearby tide pools, and in the summer birdsong fills the air. The town offers a variety of leisure activities, from surfing and hiking to exploring the shops and cafes that line the main street. On a clear night, one can see the stars twinkle in the indigo sky. This small town by the sea is a perfect place for a getaway.",
