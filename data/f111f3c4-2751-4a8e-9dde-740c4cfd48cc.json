  "input": "",
  "output": "The composition fallacy is the belief that the characteristics of a subset of an object must be attributed to the object as a whole. An example of this is the Fallacy of Division, which holds that what is true of the parts of an object must also be true of the object as a whole. For example, claiming that because each student in the class is smart, the whole class must be smart.",
