  "input": "",
  "output": "Electrolytes are essential for the body to function properly. They help regulate the balance of body fluids, regulate nerve and muscle function, and maintain a steady heart rhythm. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals, such as sodium, potassium, chlorine, calcium, and magnesium, which help regulate the amount of water in the body and control the acid-base (pH) balance of cells and tissues. They also play a role in muscle contractions and normal cell functioning.",
