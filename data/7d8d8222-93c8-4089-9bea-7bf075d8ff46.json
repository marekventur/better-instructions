  "output": "The stars lull you to sleep,\nSoft whispers in the breeze,\nAll worries and stress fades away,\nAs darkness envelops me. \n\nThe bed calls out to me,\nA dreamy sweet escape,\nTo a place without worries,\nWhere worries I can't face.\n\nMy eyes grow heavy,\nMy consciousness slips away,\nInto a peaceful slumber,\nI peacefully lay.",
