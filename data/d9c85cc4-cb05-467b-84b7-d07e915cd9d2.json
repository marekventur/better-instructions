Unfortunately, many of the people she encountered were unkind and ungrateful for her efforts. One day, she decided to go in search of a place where she would be welcomed and appreciated. After walking for what felt like days, she found a small village nestled in the mountains. The people welcomed her with open arms and there, Sarah found a true home for the first time in her life. She never felt more content and fulfilled.",
