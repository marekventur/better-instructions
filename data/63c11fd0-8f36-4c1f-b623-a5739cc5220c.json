  "input": "",
  "output": "When resolving a dispute, I have found success by first listening to both sides carefully and patiently before taking action. I then take the time to understand the underlying motives and ascertain the desired outcome for all parties involved. I then formulate a solution that respects those outcomes while taking into account the needs and perspectives of both sides. This helps to create a space where all parties can feel heard and confident that the best solution has been reached.",
