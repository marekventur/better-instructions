  "output": "The basic concept of relativity is that the laws of physics remain the same in all inertial frames of reference, regardless of their relative motion or acceleration. This means that if two observers are in relative motion to each other, they will still experience the same truths of physics. This means that if one observer sees a particular event happen at a certain time, the other observer will also observe that same event at the same time, even if they are in different frames of reference moving at different speeds.",
