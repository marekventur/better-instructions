  "input": "Problem: A team is having communication issues.",
  "output": "One way to solve communication issues within a team is to listen and respect each other's opinions. Encourage an open dialogue, and make sure that everyone has a chance to speak without interruption. Set clear expectations, agree on deadlines and make sure responsibilities are divided evenly. Additionally, ensure that everyone is on the same page with the team's goals and objectives. Finally, practice active listening, which involves repeating the speaker's point back to the speaker to ensure understanding and avoid misunderstandings.",
