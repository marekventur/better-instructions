  "instruction": "Calculate the number of months it will take to double the amount of money in a bank account that earns an annual 6% interest rate.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The calculation for the number of months it will take to double the money in a bank account earning an annual 6% interest rate is approximately 11.5 years. This can be determined by using the rule of 72, which states that 72 divided by the annual interest rate gives the number of years it takes for an investment to double. In this case, 72 / 6 = 12, and 12 years = 144 months.  Therefore, it will take approximately 144 months (11.5 years) for the money in the bank account to double.",
