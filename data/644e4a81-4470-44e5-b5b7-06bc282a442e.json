  "input": "",
  "output": "The key difference between IP over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and IP over Ethernet (Ethernet) is in their basic underlying technology. Ethernet is a packet-switched technology based on CSMA/CD protocol and it uses Ethernet frames for data transmission. On the other hand, ATM is a connection-oriented technology that uses fixed-sized packets called cells for data transmission. \nEthernet works on the principle of broadcasting, wherein data is sent out over all physical wires at the same time. But ATM is a point to point communication system, which means data is sent only to a specific destination. \nEthernet is mostly used for local area networking and it is easier to configure. ATM is mostly used in wide area networking and is more secure than Ethernet.",
