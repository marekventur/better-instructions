  "input": "",
  "output": "A practical solution to the water crisis could include targeting water wastage and encouraging water conservation measures through public awareness campaigns. Governments could also launch initiatives to clean and purify polluted water sources, while also investing in innovative technologies to improve water management, such as desalination plants and rainwater storage systems. Additionally, water pricing policies can be implemented to incentivize efficient use, and taxation systems can be used to mitigate overuse of water resources. Finally, investments should be made in water infrastructure, such as pipes and canals, to ensure that water is accessible for all.",
