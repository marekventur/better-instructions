  "input": "",
  "output": "The scoping rule of a variable is a set of rules that determine the visibility and accessibility of variables inside a program. A variable's scope is the region of the program in which it is visible and can be used. The scope of a variable may be local, meaning it can be accessed in a specific region of the program such as within a function, or it may be global, meaning it can be accessed anywhere within the program. In many programming languages, variables that are declared inside a block of code (for example, within an if statement or loop) are considered to have a local scope and are not visible outside of the block in which they are declared.",
