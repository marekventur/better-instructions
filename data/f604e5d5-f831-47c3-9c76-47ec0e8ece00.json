  "output": "1. Image Classification: Machine Learning is used to classify objects in an image and generate labels for them. Image classification models are trained using a large number of labeled images that are used as input. The model is then used to predict the label of an image based on its features. \n\n2. Natural Language Processing: Machine Learning is used to process natural language, such as in speech recognition, text analysis, and machine translation. The models are trained on tagged text and audio data and then used to generate understanding of natural language content.",
