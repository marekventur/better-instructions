  "output": "Laughter shines like a sunny day,\nFrom its light sorrows flee away.\n\nDelight and joy its melody brings,\nBrightening all life's little things.\n\nIt's a spark to wake the sleepy soul,\nRejoicing all from pole to pole.\n\nBanish doubts and do not fear,\nWith your laughter money can't buy cheer.",
