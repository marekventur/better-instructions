  "input": "",
  "output": "Five ways to reduce energy consumption include: unplugging electronic devices when not in use; turning off the lights when leaving a room; switching to LED or CFL lightbulbs; installing motion-detecting light switches; and using natural light through larger windows and skylights. Additionally, replacing old appliances with energy-efficient models and installing weatherstripping to reduce air leaks can also help to reduce energy consumption. Installing insulation and solar panels, upgrading to a smart thermostat, and reducing water waste can all contribute to a more efficient home and reduce energy usage. Finally, educating oneself on energy conservation and changing habits, such as turning off the tap while brushing one's teeth and washing clothes in cold water, can also help reduce energy consumption.",
