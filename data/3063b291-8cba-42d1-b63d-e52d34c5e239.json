  "output": "I have been on a journey through life,\nSearching for a vision, exploring strife. \nThough it has not been easy, I persevere \nKnowing I will reach my endpoint, come what may here.\n\nWeaving tales cut out of time, \nFilled with darkness with a heavenly shine. \nTo find solace I must continue to sail\nThough I have taken on a consequential trail. \n\nExpectations were never really high \nThough I must find a way to make the sky my alibi. \nIt's a route filled with potholes and crevices,\nBut I must remain steady and seek constant bliss.\n\nIt's been a wild ride, rolling with punches and thrills,\nSeeking out a place that my heart can fulfill. \nI take each day with a sense of calm \nAnd I will make it in the end, come what my journey may hold.",
