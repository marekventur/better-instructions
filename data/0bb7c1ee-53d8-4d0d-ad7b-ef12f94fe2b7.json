  "output": "Gregory was walking through the forest when he stumbled upon a large spider spinning its web between two trees. He grabbed a nearby stick, poking it to see if the spider would move. Suddenly, a shimmering knife appeared in the web and Gregory realised that there must have been some kind of enchantment at work. Curious, he tried to grab it but the spider quickly picked it up with its legs. It then climbed up the tree and dropped it into a hollow within the trunk. When Gregory peeked into the hollow, he saw an old book with a lock on it. He wondered what mysteries the book held inside.",
