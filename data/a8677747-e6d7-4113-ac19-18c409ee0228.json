  "input": "",
  "output": "AI technology can help diagnose a medical condition by analyzing medical images, such as x-rays, CT scans, and ultrasounds. AI can be used to scan images for early warning signs of a condition, such as a tumor or aneurysm, and present the results to a human specialist to confirm the diagnosis. AI can also be used to sift through large amounts of medical data, such as patient records and lab test results, to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate a potential medical issue. Additionally, AI can be used to analyze a patient's symptoms and compare them to known illnesses or diseases in order to assist with a diagnosis.",
