  "instruction": "Generate a design for a modern office layout.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The design of a modern office layout should involve ergonomic furnishings, open spaces and bright colors. Ergonomic furniture should include adjustable computer desks and chairs, which will allow employees to maintain good posture and minimize fatigue. Open spaces provide an office that promotes collaboration and creativity, while bright colors increase productivity and morale. A good office layout should also provide natural light, plenty of storage for documents, and access to amenities such as a coffee machine and a wine fridge.",
