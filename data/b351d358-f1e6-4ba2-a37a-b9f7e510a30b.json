  "instruction": "How would you summarize the process of nuclear fission in four sentences?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a nucleus into smaller nuclei, resulting in the release of energy. It is typically initiated by bombarding a heavier element with neutrons, causing it to split into two lighter elements. Fission can also be triggered by the absorption of gamma rays. During the fission process, neutrons, energy, and radiation are released, which can be used to generate electricity. Nuclear fission can be a source of sustainable energy, but carries a risk of a nuclear meltdown if it is not managed carefully.",
