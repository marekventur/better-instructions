  "output": "The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) brings its own set of advantages and risks, including the potential for the technology to harm humans or have unintended consequences. In order to ensure its safe development, it is necessary to regulate AI. Regulations can ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically, while also protecting people's human rights, creating transparency, and minimizing the potential for abuses. Regulations also can help ensure accountability, promote public trust in the technology, and allow better cross-border cooperation. Government oversight and regulation of AI is essential in order to ensure that its power is used responsibly and ethically.",
