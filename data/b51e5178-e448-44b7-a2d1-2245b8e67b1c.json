  "input": "",
  "output": "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that are often used for storing large amounts of data. They provide an alternative to traditional SQL databases which require a predefined schema and are optimized for handling structured data. NoSQL databases offer greater scalability and flexibility than traditional SQL databases, and are often better suited for applications that require a distributed architecture and/or require high availability.",
