  "input": "",
  "output": "One time I failed was when I was trying to finish a project for school and I always pushed it off until the last minute. I didn't give myself enough time to work on my project and in the end, it was not up to the standard that I should have been producing. I learned from this experience to always start my projects earlier, break them up into smaller tasks, and have a plan to complete them in order to avoid a similar failure in the future.",
