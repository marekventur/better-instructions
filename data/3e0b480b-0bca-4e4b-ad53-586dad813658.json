  "input": "",
  "output": "Keeping your house cool in the heat can be achieved by making use of natural cooling methods. Close curtains and blinds to block the sun from entering your home. Create cross-ventilation by opening windows on opposite sides of the house. Invest in a fan to help circulate the air, or look for ways to increase the shade around your house. To prevent heat from entering your home, consider installing insulation and also make sure your air conditioning unit is running efficiently.",
