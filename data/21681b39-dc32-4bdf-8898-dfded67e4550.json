  "input": "",
  "output": "It is impossible to make a definitive prediction regarding the stock price of Apple Inc. tomorrow, as a variety of factors may affect the value of the stock. We do know that the current price of Apple's stock is $85.99, so there is potential for the stock to rise if market factors remain stable. Factors such as company performance, economic conditions, and investor sentiment will all play a role in the stock price movement. Until then, it is not possible to accurately predict if the stock price will be higher than $90 tomorrow.",
