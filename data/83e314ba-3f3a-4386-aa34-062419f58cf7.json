  "output": "Carnivorous plants are a type of plant that obtain their nutrient by trapping and digesting small animals and insects. They typically have specialized trapping structures, such as leaves that form hollows for trapping small animals, or snap-trap mechanisms that close rapidly when triggered by an animal. They also possess enzymes and bacteria that aid in digestion. Carnivorous plants have adapted to their nutrient-poor habitats, and serve an important role in the food chain by keeping numbers of insect populations in check.",
