In the distance, she saw a dazzling white palace, and before she knew it, she was walking towards it. Beside her, people went about their business, their faces beaming with joy and unfamiliar languages. Livia couldn't contain her sense of wonder as she witnessed the creation of a brand new world and a way of life she had never seen before. As she entered the palace gates, she knew she would never be the same.",
