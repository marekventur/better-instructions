  "output": "The primary contributing factors to climate change include emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, deforestation, and the loss of wetlands and other habitats. Carbon dioxide emissions are primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels and other industrial activities. Deforestation and other land-use changes cause the Earth to absorb less carbon dioxide, leading to an increase in global temperatures. The loss of wetlands and other habitats reduces the planet's ability to absorb carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, exacerbating the climate change problem.",
