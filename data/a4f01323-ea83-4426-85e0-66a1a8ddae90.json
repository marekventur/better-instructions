  "output": "Child obesity has become an increasingly dangerous problem in recent years. One of the major causes is poor diet, especially among young children who are unable to make their own food choices. Unhealthy food is often cheaper, more available, and more appealing than healthy food, making it an attractive choice for parents facing financial pressures. Lack of access to outdoor space and recreational programs can lead to a decrease in exercise and physical activity, leading to increased weight gain. Additionally, the reliance on digital devices has led to an increasing sedentary lifestyle and the use of screens to entertain and occupy children. These factors, in combination with inadequate sleep and an overall lack of awareness regarding exposure to unhealthy food and behaviors, have led to an environment where the prevalence of childhood obesity continues to rise.",
