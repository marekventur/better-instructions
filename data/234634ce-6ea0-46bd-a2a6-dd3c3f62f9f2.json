  "input": "",
  "output": "Capitalism and socialism are two opposite economic systems. In capitalism, the means of production and distribution are privately owned, and the market determines what goods and services should be produced. In socialism, the means of production and distribution are collectively owned and managed by the people, and the government is responsible for managing the economy. Capitalism emphasizes individual achievement and profitability, while socialism emphasizes collective ownership and meeting the needs of all people equally.",
