  "input": "",
  "output": "The phrase \"keeping up with the Joneses\" originated in 1913 as the title of a comic strip by Arthur R. \"Pop\" Momand. In the comic strip, two families, the Smiths and the Joneses, were portrayed as two middle-class families that were constantly competing to one-up each other in possessions and appearances. The phrase has since come to describe the constant striving for material possessions that reflect social class and comparison to one's peers.",
