  "input": "The newly-elected group of representatives have proposed a different approach to trade policy.",
  "output": "The political winds are shifting in Washington, as a new group of representatives are proposing a new approach to the nation's trade policy. This change in philosophy could have a significant effect on how trade agreements are negotiated in the future. This puts emphasis on the importance of consensus-building and collaboration on a global scale. \n\nThe traditional model of trade policy has long been dictated by the interests of powerful nations. Countries with a greater economic heft have been able to use strong-arm negotiating tactics to shape trade policies in their favor. This isn't sustainable as the world is becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent. \n\nThe new approach proposed by this group of representatives looks to involve all nations, regardless of size or economic strength. It seeks to prioritize sustainable economic growth, environmental protection and human rights. This shows an understanding of what's needed to make sure a responsible global economy can function. \n\nWhether or not these policies can be implemented on a global scale remains to be seen, but this group of representatives is showing a refreshing grasp of the issues. They understand that all nations should have a say in forming global trade policies. This should make for a fairer and more equitable trading environment, where all countries benefit from vibrant and sustainable economies.",
