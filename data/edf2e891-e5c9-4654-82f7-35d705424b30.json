  "output": "Three ways to extend the battery life of a laptop are:\n\n- Reduce your screen brightness and adjust the settings so that it will automatically dim itself when not in use. \n- Use the battery saver mode on your laptop to reduce the power consumption. \n- Limit the number of programs running in the background and disable automatic updates. \n- Unplug the adapter when your laptop battery is fully charged. \n- Upgrade the RAM, use solid-state drives, and reduce the number of unnecessary apps. \n- Install energy-efficient software and stop running applications that are not in use.",
