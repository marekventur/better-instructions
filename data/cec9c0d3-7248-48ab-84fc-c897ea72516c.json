  "output": "When it comes to editing text, there are a few mistakes that should be avoided. One of the most common is making changes to the grammar, spelling, and punctuation without paying attention to the context and intent of the text. This can lead to unintentional changes that alter the meaning of the text. Another mistake is focusing too much on syntax, missing out on inconsistencies in the flow or tone of the text. Finally, editing too many times can lead to overwhelming fatigue and sloppy mistakes, so it is often important to take breaks and look back with fresh eyes.",
