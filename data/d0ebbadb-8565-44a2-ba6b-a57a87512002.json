  "input": "",
  "output": "Caring for a houseplant properly begins with selecting a species that is well-suited for the environment. Most houseplants need bright, indirect sunlight and should be watered regularly, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. For most plants, it is best to water with room temperature water and avoid excessive fertilizer. Be sure to keep the plant clean by wiping the leaves with a damp cloth free of any harsh chemicals. The type of potting soil and size of container should be appropriate for the given species. Finally, it is important to monitor the condition of the plant and address any pests or diseases promptly.",
