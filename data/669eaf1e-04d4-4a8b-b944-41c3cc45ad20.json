  "input": "",
  "output": "There are several ways to invest in cryptocurrency. The most common is buying cryptocurrency directly either on an exchange or over-the-counter, or through a broker. Investors can also purchase cryptocurrency tokens during an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and receive tokens in exchange. Another option is to invest in cryptocurrency funds, which pool money from investors and buy multiple cryptocurrencies at once. Investing in cryptocurrency futures and options is also possible, allowing investors to speculate on the cryptocurrency prices without owning the tokens. Finally, investors can invest in start-ups that are utilizing blockchain technology or in companies that accept cryptocurrency payments.",
