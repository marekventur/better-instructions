  "output": "One time I encountered a woman at the grocery store who was in desperate need of diapers for her baby. She had only enough money for herself and was about to leave with nothing for her child. I offered her the money she needed to purchase the diapers and other essential items for the baby. It was an incredibly uplifting experience and I felt privileged to be in a position to help.",
