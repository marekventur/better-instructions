  "instruction": "Prove that the sum of two positive integers is always positive.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The sum of two positive integers is always positive because any two positive integers can be represented by a larger number on the number line. For example, if two positive integers a and b are represented by points A and B, respectively, on the number line, then the sum a+b is represented by the point C, which is further to the right than either A or B. Since the direction on the number line is always the same, and the sum is always farther to the right, the sum of two positive integers is always positive.",
