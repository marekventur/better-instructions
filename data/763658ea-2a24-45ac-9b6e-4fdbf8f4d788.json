  "input": "",
  "output": "The Five Forces Model of Industry Competition was developed by Michael Porter and suggests that there are five forces that affect the profitability and attractiveness of any given industry. These forces are suppliers, buyers, competitive rivalry, threats of substitutions and new entrants. Suppliers and buyers have the power to influence prices and the availability of resources to a company. Competitive rivalry refers to how competitive the industry is and how difficult it is for companies to maintain their market share. The threat of substitutes and new entrants considers how easy it is for consumers to substitute a product or service with another or for new companies to enter the market.",
