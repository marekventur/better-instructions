  "input": "",
  "output": "Robots can be used in hazardous environments to perform dangerous and complex tasks without putting people at risk. They use sensors and teleoperation to collect data or complete tasks in areas that are too difficult or dangerous for humans to operate in. Robots can also be programmed to perform repetitive tasks with accuracy and speed, thereby reducing the amount of time and resources needed. Additionally, robotic systems can operate autonomously, and with precision and accuracy, in high-risk or remote environments that have limited human presence. Finally, robots can be programmed to monitor environment variables, such as temperature and radiation levels, to help reduce the risks of exposure for people working in hazardous environments.",
