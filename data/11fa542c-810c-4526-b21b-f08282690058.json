The people of the kingdom believed that the rainbow held magical power, and that if they looked through the rainbow's seven colors, they may see into the future. \n\nOne night, a brave adventurer decided to find out if the stories were true. He climbed to the top of a mountain and waited for the rainbow to appear. When it did, he closed his eyes and looked directly into the rainbow's seven colors. \n\nThe adventurer was amazed to find that the rainbow opened a portal in time. He was now able to see five years into the future and could help the people of his kingdom prepare for the hardships ahead. \n\nFrom then on, the rainbow was venerated and became a symbol of hope for the people of the kingdom. The adventurer was promised riches for his discovery, but all he wanted was the knowledge that he had helped his people, and this was the best reward of all.",
