  "instruction": "Build a neural network for predicting stock prices in the given market.",
  "input": "Shanghai Stock Exchange",
  "output": "The model would first use financial data (e.g. earnings of a company, business news, prevailing market sentiment) as the input variables. The output would then be a prediction of the stock's future price. To start building the model, we would first explore the data available and clean it for any missing information. We would also perform feature engineering to identify the most powerful features which reliably sink with the price behavior. After that, we would train the model with different neural network models like shallow nn, deep nn, and recurrent nn. On top of the neural network models, hyperparameter tuning should be performed in order to further optimize the models. Once the model is ready, it can be deployed for real-time predictions of the stock in the Shanghai Stock Exchange.",
