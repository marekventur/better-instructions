  "input": "",
  "output": "Poverty is linked to poor health for a variety of reasons. Many people who live in poverty are unable to afford basic necessities such as healthy food, adequate shelter, and medical care, which leads to greater risk of health conditions like obesity and other chronic illnesses. Furthermore, poverty often limits access to education and other opportunities, resulting in less knowledge about healthy habits and higher chances of injury or illness due to environmental factors. Additionally, poorer communities often lack mental health services and resources, which can exacerbate existing health problems.",
