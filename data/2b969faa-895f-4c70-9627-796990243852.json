  "instruction": "Compare and contrast playing an instrument to playing a sport.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Both playing an instrument and playing a sport involve physical and mental activities. Playing an instrument requires an understanding of musical notation, technical ability and a mastery of the instrument itself. It also demands a deep emotional understanding and interpretation of the music. Playing a sport, on the other hand, requires learning basic skills and then honing them to a high level of expertise. It requires discipline, practice, and coordination with other players in order to accomplish goals. Both types of activities involve an intense level of concentration, commitment and dedication.",
