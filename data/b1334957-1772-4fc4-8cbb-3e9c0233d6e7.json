  "input": "",
  "output": "Three different approaches to estimating the effectiveness of an organization's training program include pre- and post-training surveys, observation of employees\u2019 work performance, and comparison of actual performance with training goals. Pre- and post-surveys can be used to compare the knowledge and attitudes of employees before and after the training program, and can provide insights into not just the training program but potentially other aspects of the organization as well. Observation of employees\u2019 work performance can help to identify whether the training program\u2019s content is being applied on the job and whether it is having tangible effects on performance. Comparison of actual performance to training goals provides real-time feedback on the progress of the training program and can be used to identify potential areas for improvement.",
