  "input": "",
  "output": "Security measures that can be taken to protect a connected car include encrypting all of the car\u2019s data communication, constantly patching the car\u2019s software and operating system, firewalling all ports and the car\u2019s internal networks from external access, using secure authentication procedures to access the car\u2019s systems, and monitoring all of the car\u2019s activities for potential threats. Additionally, connected cars can be enabled with endpoint protection that limits the ability of hackers to gain access to its networks, as well as malware prevention programs that can detect and prevent malicious software from executing on the car\u2019s systems. These security measures will ensure that the connected car is securely protected from potential cyber threats.",
