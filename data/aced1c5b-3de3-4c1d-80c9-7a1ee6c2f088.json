  "input": "",
  "output": "The main disadvantage of democracy is that it gives the majority decision-making power, which often leads to mob rule. Additionally, democracy can become corrupted by money and power, which results in unequal access to resources and unequal representation. Furthermore, certain minority groups can often be excluded from the political process and may not get the representation they deserve.",
