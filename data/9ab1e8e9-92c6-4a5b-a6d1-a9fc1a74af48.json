  "input": "",
  "output": "It is best to store fresh produce in airtight containers in the refrigerator. Additionally, most fruits and vegetables should be washed before storing in the refrigerator, as this helps to prevent cross-contamination and spoilage. Some vegetables and fruits should be stored in cool, dry places, such as a crisper drawer, while others should be left on the counter. It is important to check the label on the packaging to make sure you are storing the produce correctly.",
