Environmental Health Perspectives, 120(7), 911-19.\nThis paper discusses the link between climate change and public health with an emphasis on impacts, vulnerabilities, and strategies for adaptation and mitigation. It aims to make impacts more tangible, while also highlighting the need to ensure that adaptive mechanisms are in place.\n\n2. Ebi, K. L. (2008). Human health in a changing climate. Environmental impact assessment review, 28(3-4), 191-198.\nThis article discusses the potential effects of climate change on human health and how it will vary according to the different variables of the environment. It provides an overview of the main diseases that are likely to be impacted, such as malaria and malnutrition. \n\n3. Friel, Sharon & M\u00fcller-Nordhorn, Jochen & McMichael, A.J.. (2008). Impacts of climate change on the health of populations: an example from SE Asia. Environmental Impact Assessment Review. 28. 573-586. 10.1016/j.eiar.2008.04.001.\nThis paper provides an example of how climate change can affect human health in Southeast Asia, as well as how local health infrastructure can be adapted and used to minimize its consequences. \n\n4. Lemmen, D. S., Warren, F. J., Lacroix, J. A., & Taylor, M. G. (2008). From Impacts to Adaptation: Canada in a Changing Climate 2007. Ottawa, ON: Government of Canada.\nThis report from the Government of Canada examines how climate change can affect human health on a local level in Canada. It focuses on the direct and indirect impacts which can result from changes in temperature, ozone levels, and air pollution.\n\n5. Le Six et al. (2009). Health Implications of Climate Change in Canada. CMAJ: Canadian Medical Association Journal,180(11), 1151\u20131156. https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.090005\nThis paper examines how climate change can cause health issues in Canada. It describes how population density, geographic location, and socio-economic status influence the degree of health risk due to climate change. \n\n6. Matz, M. & Rumble, C. & Rocklov, J. (2010). Climate change, human health and infectious diseases. International Journal of Public Health. 55. 327-335. 10.1007/s00038-010-0172-7.\nThis article provides an overview of how climate change is likely to affect the spread of infectious diseases, as well as how public health interventions can be implemented to reduce the impact of these diseases.\n\n7. Patz, J.A., Campbell-Lendrum, D.H., Holloway, T., Foley, J.A. (2005). Impact of regional climate change on human health. Nature. 438 (7): a30-a33. doi:10.1038/nature04188\nThis paper examines the potential impacts of regional climate change on human health, with a focus on temperature, humidity, and changes in precipitation. It explores how these changes could lead to an increase in the spread of certain diseases.\n\n8. Reid, P., Brown, M., & Moser, S. (2007). Human health and climate change: assessing the evidence. Health risks of climate change: an assessment of the evidence. London: Department of Health.\nThis report examines how climate change can affect human health in the UK. It provides a comprehensive overview of the evidence on the impacts of climate change, in order to inform public health interventions.\n\n9. Shindell, D., Schmuck, R., & Stone, D. (2013).

International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 10(1), 443-73. doi:10.3390/ijerph10010443\nThis paper examines the health risks posed by climate change in the United States, focusing on air and water pollutant concentrations, vector-borne diseases, vegetation-related allergies and infectious diseases, and floods and heat waves.\n\n10. WHO (2007). Impacts of climate change on human health - Setting the World Health Organization agenda in the 21st Century. World Health Organization.\nThis report outlines the potential health impacts of climate change and ways to mitigate them. It provides a review of evidence and recommendations for public health intervention, in order to reduce the health risks posed by climate change.",
