  "input": "",
  "output": "Once upon a time, there was an old man who lived on the edge of a lake. Every morning, he would take a walk along the lake's edge, enjoying the peace and tranquility the lake provided. \nOne day, the man threw a pebble into the lake, and watched as the pebble created ripples that slowly spread across the lake's surface. As he watched the waves go out further and further, he realised that his small action had had a much bigger impact than he expected.\n\nThe man smiled as he thought about how the same principle for ripple effects applied to his actions in his everyday life. He knew that the decisions he made, no matter how seemingly small, had consequences that could reverberate out infinitely into the future. He felt a sense of responsibility and realised the importance of looking at the long term impact of his actions before making a decision.",
