  "input": "Movie: Finding Nemo",
  "output": "The main characters in Finding Nemo are Marlin, an overly protective clownfish father to Nemo, and Dory, an endearing but forgetful blue tang fish. Marlin is a loving father, but is more fearful of the dangers of the ocean because of the loss of his wife and most of their eggs. Meanwhile, Dory is optimistic and adventurous, but her short-term memory loss makes it difficult for her to remember important things.",
