  "output": "Two key challenges faced in developing artificial general intelligence are the ability to process natural language and the ability to make decisions in complex, real-world tasks. Natural language processing requires the ability to understand spoken or written words, and to interpret the meaning in order to carry out a task. Decisions in complex tasks require the AI system to assess multiple variables, understand the ethics associated with the outcome, and be able to adjust those assessments as needed.",
