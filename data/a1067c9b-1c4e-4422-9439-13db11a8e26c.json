  "output": "The water cycle is a never-ending process of evaporation, condensation and precipitation which keeps the water on Earth in circulation. In the process, water evaporates from bodies of water such as oceans, lakes and rivers into the atmosphere. Then, the water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into clouds, which then release moisture through precipitation back onto the surface of the Earth. This precipitation flows into bodies of water, and the cycle continues.",
