  "input": "",
  "output": "Blockchain-based networks can be used to solve the double spending problem because of their distributed ledger technology. A blockchain is a decentralized system where all transactions are recorded in a publicly distributed ledger, making it impossible to perpetrate a double spend attack. In addition, a blockchain also prevents cheating by using cryptographic algorithms to secure the network and verify transactions. This ensures that the blockchain is immutable, meaning that all records on the ledger are permanently stored and cannot be tampered with. As a result, blockchain systems are highly secure and offer enhanced protection against double spending.",
