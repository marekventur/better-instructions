  "input": "",
  "output": "In Java, a statement is a language construct that is executed when the program runs. A statement is a logical instruction that tells the computer what action to take when it runs a program. Examples of statements include assignment statements, control flow statements, and declaration statements. An assignment statement assigns a value to a variable or an expression. Control flow statements are used to make decisions or loop through code blocks. Declaration statements declare variables and types. All of these statements make up the syntax of a Java program.",
