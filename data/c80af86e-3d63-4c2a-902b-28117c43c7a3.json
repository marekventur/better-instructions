  "input": "",
  "output": "It takes between 10 and 12 weeks to grow potatoes, depending on the variety. The potatoes need to be kept in the ground at least 7 weeks after they have flowered to reach full maturity. The soil temperature also plays an important role in the growth rate of potatoes. The ideal soil temperature range is 50-60 \u00b0F (10-16 \u00b0C). Warmer temperatures speed up the process and cooler temperatures slow it down.",
