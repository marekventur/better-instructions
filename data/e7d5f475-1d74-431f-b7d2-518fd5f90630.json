  "input": "",
  "output": "Deferred taxation is an accounting concept in which taxes are postponed to a future period, rather than paid during the current tax period. This can be done to take advantage of advantageous tax rules or to avoid taxation entirely. The implications of deferred taxation often rely on the entity's tax liability and the amount of the tax deferral. This concept can create a large advantage or disadvantage, depending on the type of business and tax rate.",
