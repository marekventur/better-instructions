During the planning stage, stakeholders define the requirements for a software system. During the design stage, developers create the architecture for the software system. During implementation, the code is written, tested and debugged. During the testing stage, developers check the functionality and quality of the code. During the maintenance stage, developers enhance the system and address any issues that arise.",
