  "output": "A romantic dinner setting might include a beautiful table draped with a white cloth, adorned with two sets of fine china and crystal glasses. A selection of tantalizing appetizers, fine wines and delicious entrees could also be arranged. A vase of freshly picked roses could be added for a final touch of elegance. Candles and a soft music playing in the background will provide a peaceful atmosphere.",
