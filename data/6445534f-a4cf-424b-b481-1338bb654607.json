  "output": "Birds and mammals are both classifications of animals, but they have several distinct differences. Birds have feathers, wings, and hollow bones, and some are able to fly. Mammals have fur or hair, mammary glands, and four limbs that are specialized for walking, running, and swimming. Birds reproduce via eggs, whereas mammals reproduce via live young. Additionally, birds are endothermic and mammals are warm-blooded.",
