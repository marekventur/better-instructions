  "output": "One example of an allegory is Animal Farm by George Orwell. In this book, the characters of the animal farm stand for the individuals and factions within the Russian Revolution. The rebellion of the animals against their human master, Mr. Jones, corresponds to the revolution of the proletariat against their bourgeois rulers. The pigs in particular represent the Bolshevik party of Vladimir Lenin.",
