  "output": "I would propose a new beauty product line formulated for millennials. The product line would offer natural and organic skin care, hair and makeup items that are both affordable and easy to use. The packaging would be eco-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. The brand would emphasize ethical sourcing and aim to empower young people, both men and women, to focus on self-care and feeling their best. The product line will include items such as affordable sheet masks, highlighting palettes, vegan makeup and skin care sets, and a line of all-natural body butters and soaps.",
