  "input": "Rising temperatures in our planet\u2019s atmosphere have many effects on the Earth\u2019s environment, including disruption of ecosystems, declining crop yields, species extinctions, and increased extreme weather events, such as floods and heat waves. This global-scale disruption is caused by increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-absorbing gases originating from human activity, such as burning fossil fuels. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as climate change.",
  "output": "Climate change is caused by humans burning fossil fuels, resulting in increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-absorbing gases in the atmosphere.
