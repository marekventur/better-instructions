  "input": "",
  "output": "Single-use plastics can have devastating effects on our environment. They are not biodegradable and take hundreds of years to break down. This means they are around for a long time, acting as pollutants and filling up landfills. Single-use plastics also contribute to global warming and can have a serious effect on our oceans and the animals that live in them. By avoiding single-use plastics we can significantly reduce our carbon emissions and help preserve the planet for future generations. We all have a responsibility to reduce our plastic footprint. Let's make a conscious effort to limit our use of single-use plastics and make sure that we are doing our part to help save the planet.",
