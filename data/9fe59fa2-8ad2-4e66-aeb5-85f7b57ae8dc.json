  "input": "",
  "output": "Online education can help students of low-income families by providing greater access to education at a much lower cost. Online courses and virtual classrooms can be used to bridge the digital divide due to lack of physical access to educational institutions and the lack of financial resources. Online education also allows students to have more flexibility with their studies, since classes can be taken at any time, from any place. Additionally, online courses enable educators to tailor the curriculum to individual student's needs, as well as give personal attention to each student. Finally, online education can help low-income students gain access to engaging materials, such as interactive videos, podcasts, e-books, and other visual tools. This can be especially beneficial for those students who have difficulty understanding the material in a traditional classroom setting.",
