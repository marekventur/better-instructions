  "instruction": "Predict what will happen if the government implements a full lockdown due to the ongoing pandemic.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "If the government implements a full lockdown, it is likely that the spread of the virus would be reduced drastically. This means that businesses and schools would be closed, people would be impacted financially, travel restrictions would be in place, and families and friends would not be able to visit one another. It is likely that this would cause a great deal of stress and anxiety for individuals and would lead to an increase in mental health issues. On the other hand, implementing a full lockdown would also reduce the number of people who contract the virus, save lives, and give us the opportunity to flatten the curve.",
