  "output": "I can\u2019t believe I'm so far from home. It seems like it was just yesterday that I was in my favorite spot on the hill in my hometown. I\u2019d walk to the top, kick off my shoes, and just look out over everything. That view was so comforting to me, especially on days when I was feeling overwhelmed or homesick.\n\nNow I\u2019m hundreds of miles away at college and the thought of being so far from home feels like a crushing weight on my chest. I miss the familiar faces, the smells, the sounds, and the unique rhythm of home. \n\nI never thought I'd miss it as much as I do now. I always assumed I\u2019d view myself as an adventurous, independent person, but here I am\u2014homesick and wishing I was in my hometown again.",
