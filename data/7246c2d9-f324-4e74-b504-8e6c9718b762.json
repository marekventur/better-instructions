  "instruction": "Describe the concept of media framing.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Media framing is the practice of emphasizing certain aspects of an issue to influence the way people think about the topic. It involves choosing particular words and images to shape the public's perception of an event or situation. For example, a news network might cover a political scandal by focusing on the deceptive or damaging behavior of the involved parties rather than their effort to address the situation and repair any harm caused. This type of coverage would be considered a media frame. Media frames can be used to create a certain emotion or attitude in the reader and guide them to interpret an issue in a certain way. Media framing is an important tool for journalists and media outlets to shape public opinion.",
