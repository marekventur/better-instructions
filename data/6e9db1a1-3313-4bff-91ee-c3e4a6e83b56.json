  "output": "To boil an egg, start by filling a pot with cold water and adding the egg. Bring the pot to a boil and set a timer for the desired level of doneness (e.g. 3 minutes for a soft cooked egg, 8 minutes for a hard-boiled egg). When done, turn the heat off and let the egg sit in the hot water for a few more minutes. Lastly, remove the egg and run cold water over it to stop the cooking process.",
