It is characterized by the use of a variety of spices and herbs that give Indian food its unique flavor. Common ingredients used in Indian cuisine include cumin, turmeric, coriander, chili pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, garlic, nutmeg, and mustard. Indian cuisine is largely vegetarian and includes dishes such as dal and curries as well as rice or a bread-based accompaniment.
