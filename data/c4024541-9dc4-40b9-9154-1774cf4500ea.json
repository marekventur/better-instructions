  "output": "A SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module card) is a small plastic card that contains a memory chip and is used in cell phones and other devices to identify and authenticate subscribers on mobile networks. It typically contains a unique serial number, an international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number, the subscriber\u2019s personal identification number (PIN), network-specific information, and a list of the services the user has access to. Some SIM cards, such as those for dual-SIM devices, also store applications and phone book information.",
