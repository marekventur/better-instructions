  "instruction": "Explain how an electric motor works",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An electric motor works by using an electromagnet to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. It works by using an electric current to create an electromagnetic field around the motor's coil. When this field interacts with the permanent magnet it creates a force that causes the coil to rotate. This rotating motion can then be used to power a variety of machines.",
