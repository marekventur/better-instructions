  "instruction": "Describe the gravitational force between two objects with given mass and distance.",
  "input": "mass = 20 kg and distance = 2 meters",
  "output": "The gravitational force between two objects with mass 20 kg and distance 2 meters is equal to 0.0016 Newtons. This is calculated using the formula F = G x (m1 x m2) / d2, where G is the gravitational constant (6.67 x 10-11 N m2 / kg2).",
