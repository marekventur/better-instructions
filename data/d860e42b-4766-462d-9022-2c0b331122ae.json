  "input": "The natural gas transportation industry is experiencing great change. Natural gas transportation is becoming much more efficient through the use of pipelines and compression technologies, allowing for rapid transfer of natural gas from producers to consumers. This increased efficiency has allowed producers to increase the amount of gas produced and transported, leading to lower energy costs for consumers.",
  "output": "The natural gas transportation industry is making great strides in efficiency and cost savings. Through the use of pipelines and compression technology, natural gas is able to be quickly transported from producers to consumers, resulting in increased production, lower energy costs and overall improved efficiency. This increased efficiency has allowed natural gas to become a much more cost-effective form of energy, allowing for lower energy costs for consumers.",
