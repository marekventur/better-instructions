  "instruction": "Propose a solution to decrease pollution in the city",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One solution to decrease pollution in the city is to encourage the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. Providing incentives such as grants, tax breaks, and loans can help households and businesses transition away from the use of fossil fuels while still having access to reliable energy sources. Additionally, increasing funding for public transportation and encouraging people to carpool or bike more can reduce the demand for cars, thereby lowering pollution. These solutions can be simultaneously implemented to create a cleaner and healthier environment for the citizens of the city.",
