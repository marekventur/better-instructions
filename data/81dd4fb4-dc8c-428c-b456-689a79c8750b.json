  "output": "A knight in shining armor is a tall and brave figure dressed in a full suit of armor, a helmet, and often a cape, shining with a metallic luster. They are usually depicted on horseback, riding into battle with weapons drawn. They also often carry a shield with a coat of arms or a flag, and often wear a longsword at their belt. The knight exudes an aura of strength, courage, and loyalty, and often fights for justice and the protection of the weak.",
