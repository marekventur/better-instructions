  "input": "",
  "output": "Deserts and temperate forests are two distinct biomes that differ in a variety of ways. Deserts are characterized by arid, desert-like conditions that lack abundant vegetation and precipitation. Temperate forests are characterized by more moderate conditions with higher levels of vegetation and precipitation. Deserts are typically warmer than temperate forests and have greater temperature fluctuations between the day and night. Temperate forests typically have more diverse wildlife than deserts, including species such as deer and birds. Deserts are typically composed of hardy, drought-tolerant plants like cacti, while temperate forests may contain a mix of deciduous, evergreen, and coniferous trees.",
