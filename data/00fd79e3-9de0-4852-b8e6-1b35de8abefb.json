  "input": "",
  "output": "It is important to understand basic geometry in AI because basic geometric shapes, such as lines, circles, and triangles, are used to represent data in many applications. For example, in computer vision, basic shapes are used to detect objects in an image or to recognize facial expressions. Basic geometry is also used in some AI algorithms, such as those in artificial neural networks which use basic geometric shapes to approximate functions. Without understanding basic geometry, it is difficult to effectively implement and understand many AI technologies.",
