  "instruction": "Describe the behavior of a prodigal son",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A prodigal son is someone who leaves their home and wastes their inheritance in reckless, indulgent behavior. This includes spending money on luxurious things, overindulging in alcohol or other vices, and engaging in any activity that brings them pleasure without regard for any sort of responsibility. They may be unwilling to take responsibility for their actions or suffer from an inflated sense of entitlement. Ultimately, the prodigal son wastes their inheritance and causes harm to those around them before eventually returning home in distress.",
