  "input": "",
  "output": "Computer programs need debugging because they often contain errors or bugs that can prevent the program from running properly. Debugging is a process of finding and fixing these errors or bugs so that the program can run as expected. Debugging allows programmers to identify logical errors, syntax errors, memory issues and other issues that may prevent the program from functioning as intended. Without debugging, programs can produce incorrect or unexpected results or may crash completely.",
