  "output": "The potential implications of artificial intelligence and automation in the future are vast. As automation increases, there could be large-scale job displacement as many manual labour and administrative tasks become automated. Additionally, ethical issues could arise, such as the question of whether or not to grant artificial intelligence rights and autonomy. Finally, it could also be beneficial as it could improve many aspects of people's day-to-day lives and make it easier to accomplish tasks.",
