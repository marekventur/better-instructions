  "output": "The global economy is still suffering from the impacts of COVID-19. In 2020, the global economy saw its worst decline since the Great Depression, with global GDP dropping by 4.3%. In 2021, the outlook is more promising, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting that global GDP will grow by 5.5%. \n\nIn the US, the economy has recovered somewhat, with the unemployment rate decreasing from its peak of 14.7% in April 2020 to 6.3% as of February 2021. Consumption and investment have also been on a steady increase. However, continued government spending to support the economy remains an issue, as the US government debt exceeds $28 trillion.\n\nIn Europe, the situation is more mixed. while Germany, France, and Russia have seen some signs of recovery, the UK is still in recession. The pandemic has also hit emerging markets especially hard, with countries such as Brazil, India, and Nigeria seeing steep declines in GDP.\n\nOverall, the global economy is slowly recovering, but there is still a long way to go.",
