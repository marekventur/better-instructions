  "input": "",
  "output": "The difference between first and third person point of view is the perspective from which the story is told. In first person point of view, the story is told using \"I\" or \"we\", while third person point of view uses third person pronouns such as \"he/she\" or \"they\". Additionally, first person point of view gives the reader a more intimate and personal perspective into the story, while third person point of view gives the reader a more omniscient and detached perspective.",
