  "input": "",
  "output": "The three main differences between humans and animals are:\n\n1. Cognitive Ability: Human beings have advanced cognitive abilities such as problem solving, abstract thought, and language. Animals possess only basic cognitive abilities.\n\n2. Self-Awareness: Humans are self-aware, meaning they are aware of their own existence and can recognize themselves in a mirror. Animals do not possess this ability.\n\n3. Cultural Development: Humans have the capacity to create and develop complex cultures and societies. Animals, on the other hand, lack the capacity for such development.",
