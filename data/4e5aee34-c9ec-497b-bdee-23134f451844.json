  "input": "",
  "output": "You would see incredible multicolored cliffs of red, orange, and brown that have been carved by the Colorado River over the centuries. The landscape is breathtaking, made up of deep ravines, narrow side canyons, limestone plateaus, and hidden valleys. Looking across the canyon, you would see sheer walls of rock stretching for miles, surrounded by a vast expanse of deserts, sandstone hills, and coniferous forests.",
