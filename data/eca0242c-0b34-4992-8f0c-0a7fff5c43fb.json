  "output": "Vincent Van Gogh's 1888 masterpiece, \"Starry Night,\" is an oil painting on canvas depicting a sleepy, moonlit village scene beneath a swirling night sky filled with stars. His use of shades of blue, violet, and cyan poetically capture the peaceful yet dreamlike atmosphere beneath the stars. He also used distinct lines and curves to create a layered composition of mountains, trees, and stars that seem to rise and move through each other to create the illusion of texture and depth. The painting has become an icon of the post-impressionist movement, and continues to inspire viewers to this day.",
