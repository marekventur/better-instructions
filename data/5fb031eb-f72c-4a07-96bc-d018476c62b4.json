  "output": "The industrial revolution was a period of dramatic change from the mid 18th century to the 19th century. It led to a massive rise in factory production, rapid urbanization, and the emergence of a largely-urban working class population. It was driven by advances in technology such as the invention of steam power and the use of new sources of energy such as coal. It fundamentally changed how people lived and worked, as well as how goods and services were produced.",
