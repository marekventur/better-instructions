  "input": "Air pollution",
  "output": "A plan to reduce air pollution should include measures such as the adoption of renewable energy sources, the development and adoption of cleaner technologies and vehicles, the implementation of stricter emission standards for industry, and the promotion of public transportation and energy-efficient behaviors. Policies should also be put in place to encourage reforestation, reduce agricultural and industrial runoff, and decrease urban sprawl. In addition, air pollution must be monitored to ensure that standards are being met and to identify areas where emissions are particularly high.",
