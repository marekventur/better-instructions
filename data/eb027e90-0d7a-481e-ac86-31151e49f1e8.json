  "output": "The fossil record provides evidence for the evolution of the horse. Fossil remains show that horses have been gradually adapting to their changing environment over time, resulting in the modern-day horse. The earliest known horse fossils date back to around 55 million years ago. Over the course of time, horses have evolved in size and shape. For example, ancient horses had four toes on each front foot, whereas the modern horse only has one. This is due to the horse's gradual adaptation to its environment, enabling the horse to better run and live on the plains.",
