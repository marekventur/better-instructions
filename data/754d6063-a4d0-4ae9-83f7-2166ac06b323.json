  "input": "",
  "output": "Once a bountiful ocean teeming with life, the sea is now facing the devastating effects of overfishing. Fish stocks are being depleted, entire species are on the brink of extinction, and ocean ecosystems are in jeopardy. As fish populations decline, fisheries are forced to take desperate measures such as illegal fishing, habitat destruction, and fishing with destructive methods like bottom trawling. Resulting in coral death, deeper ocean acidification, and further environmental degradation of the fragile marine life. Unless decisive action is taken soon, the consequences of overfishing will be catastrophic.",
