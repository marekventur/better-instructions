  "input": "",
  "output": "The main cause of the 2008 stock market crash was the collapse of the U.S. housing market, which triggered a financial crisis. Subprime mortgage defaults caused banks to lose large amounts of capital and investors to lose confidence in the stock market. Rising unemployment and declining consumer confidence also contributed to the crash.",
