  "output": "Reducing waste is an important task that we as a society must take on. One way to do this is to reduce the use of plastic, as plastic waste is a major contributor to global pollution. Reusing materials, such as using the same bag for shopping or using glass bottles multiple times, is also an important way to reduce our consumption of resources. It is only by taking these actions that we can hope for a sustainable future.",
