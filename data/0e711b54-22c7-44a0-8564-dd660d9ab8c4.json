  "input": "",
  "output": "A computer can be used to control a manufacturing process by monitoring inputs and outputs along the assembly line, adjusting settings and parameters based on real-time data, and controlling the movement of objects on the assembly line. For example, a computer can be used to control the speed of a conveyor belt, the movement of robotics arm, the speed of a drilling machine, and the temperature of a welding machine.",
