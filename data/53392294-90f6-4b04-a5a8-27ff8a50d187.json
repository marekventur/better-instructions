  "output": "Showing leadership involves more than just being in charge. It involves taking initiative, being mindful of how others perceive your actions, and being willing to take risks to make improvements. Being seen as a leader involves being assertive, but not too aggressive, in order to make sure your ideas are heard, while still showing respect for the opinions of others. Additionally, listening to feedback is essential in order to understand how colleagues perceive your thoughts and ideas. Leadership involves being open to constructive criticism and working with others to come up with solutions.",
