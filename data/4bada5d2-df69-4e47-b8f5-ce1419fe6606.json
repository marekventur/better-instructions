  "input": "The article is about how artificial intelligence (AI) could revolutionize the healthcare industry. AI can process large amounts of data quickly, allowing medical professionals to spot trends quickly and make decisions based on accurate, up-to-date information. By using AI, healthcare professionals can largely automate the process of keeping track of the vast number of medications, dosages and side effects for each patient. AI can also help automate the process of identifying diseases by analyzing medical records, CT scans and MRI scans quickly and accurately. In addition, AI can be used to diagnose mental health conditions, freeing up more time for clinicians to focus on individualized treatment plans for their patients.",
