  "instruction": "Look up the boiling point of water.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The boiling point of water is 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F), at standard atmospheric pressure. When heated at higher pressures, water's boiling point increases. For example, water will boil at a temperature of 115\u00b0C (239\u00b0F) at an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar. At higher pressures, such as those experienced at the bottom of the ocean, the boiling point of water can be as high as 374\u00b0C (705\u00b0F).",
