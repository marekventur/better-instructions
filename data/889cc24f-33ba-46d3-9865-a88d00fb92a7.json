  "output": "A chef was making his signature dish for a group of pretentious food critics. As he served them the delicious dish, he realized he had forgotten to sprinkle on the finishing touches - he had forgotten to put salt on it. The food critics proceeded to eat the dish, with the chef wincing at every bite, waiting for their reactions. After they finished, they gave it rave reviews, claiming it was one of the least salty dishes they had ever tasted.",
