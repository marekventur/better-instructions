  "output": "The stock market is like a giant marketplace where people buy and sell pieces of ownership of companies. You can think of these pieces of ownership as shares. Companies want people to invest in them so they can use the money to build their business and grow. When people invest in a company, they are hoping the company will do well and their shares will go up in value, so they can sell them and make money.",
