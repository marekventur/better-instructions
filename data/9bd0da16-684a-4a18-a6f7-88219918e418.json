  "input": "",
  "output": "The economic impact of Brexit has yet to be fully realized, but the UK economy is expected to be worse off after Brexit. The UK's economic growth is expected to be weaker post-Brexit due to trade barriers, lack of access to European labor markets, weak investment, and higher costs of goods and services. The decline in the value of the British pound could lead to higher prices of imported goods, which will negatively affect businesses and households. Furthermore, uncertainty over future trade and regulatory relations with the EU could further negatively affect the UK's economy in the years to come.",
