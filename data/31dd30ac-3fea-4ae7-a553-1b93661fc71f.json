  "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use energy from the sun, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose, the main energy source for cellular processes. During photolysis, the energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll, which separates the hydrogen from the oxygen in water molecules. The oxygen is then released back into the atmosphere, while the hydrogen and carbon dioxide are combined to form glucose. The glucose is then further converted into other forms of energy, such as starch and fats, which are used by the cells for growth and development.",
