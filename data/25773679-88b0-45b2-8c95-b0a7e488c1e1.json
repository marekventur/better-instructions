  "instruction": "What is the difference between linear regression and logistic regression?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Linear regression is a type of regression analysis which is used to predict the value of a dependent variable by fitting a linear equation to a dataset. It assumes the relationship between independent and dependent variables to be linear and the model is trained using a least-squares optimization algorithm. On the other hand, logistic regression is a type of classification technique used to predict the probability that an instance belongs to a certain class. It is used when the dependent variable is binary and the independent variables are continuous. It is trained using a logistic/sigmoid function so that the output probabilities are between 0 and 1.",
