  "output": "The cause of the internet outage could be due to a variety of reasons, including physical damage to infrastructure such as cable lines, excessive congestion of data traffic, or a disruption with the provider's network. It could also be due to a software or hardware problem with the router and modem, such as an outdated firmware.
