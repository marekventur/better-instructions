  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a witch, a werewolf, and a friendly ghost in a mysterious forest. Every night, the werewolf howled at the moon and roamed the forest, while the witch brewed her magical potions and the ghost looked for mischief. One night it rained cats and dogs, flooding the forest. The witch's potions were ruined, the werewolf was lost, and the ghost was feeling terribly lonely. As luck would have it, the werewolf found shelter at the witch's cabin while the ghost stumbled upon a bright, silver-colored boat. The ghost took the boat and invited the werewolf to join him. The witch, too, joined in believing it would help her make her potions in the future. They sailed the boat across the murky waters, with the ghost leading the way. In time, they realized they had a special bond, like a family. They decided to stay together and eventually became quite famous for their special talent.\nSource:https://www.morethanastory.com/stories/werewolf-witch-ghost-story/2839/1/0/0",
