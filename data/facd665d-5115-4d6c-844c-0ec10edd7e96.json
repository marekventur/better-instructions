  "input": "Tic-tac-toe",
  "output": "To win at tic-tac-toe, you must create a strategy to get three in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. It's important to think ahead and block your opponent's moves. To make sure that your opponent can't make a line of three in a row, you must stay one step ahead of them by setting up your own opportunities for victory.",
