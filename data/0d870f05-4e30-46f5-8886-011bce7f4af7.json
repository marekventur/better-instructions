  "input": "My computer keeps freezing",
  "output": "If your computer keeps freezing, the first step you should take is to make sure your computer has all the latest updates installed. You can check for updates by opening the \"Settings\" menu and searching for \"Check for Updates.\" If you find updates, install them and then restart your computer. You should also try to clean up the hard drive, if possible. You can do this by opening the \"Disk Cleanup\" menu and selecting files that you don't need to delete. Finally, you should check the system logs to see if there are any issues that can be traced back to a driver, software, or hardware problem.",
