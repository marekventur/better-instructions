  "input": "Alone together",
  "output": "An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two seemingly contradictory words or concepts. In this case, \"alone\" refers to being isolated and \"together\" refers to being a part of a group. Therefore, being together while being alone is a contradiction, making the phrase an oxymoron.",
