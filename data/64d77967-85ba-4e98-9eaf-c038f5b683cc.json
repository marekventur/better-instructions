  "input": "",
  "output": "Developing a prediction model to predict stock prices of company X requires thorough data analysis and understanding of the company's market action. First, collect data related to related market indices and put them in a time-series dataset. Then use a regression model such as a linear regression or an Artificial Neural Network to create a prediction model. Exploratory data analysis should be conducted to identify factors affecting the stock prices, such as company news, macroeconomic conditions, or other stocks in the same industry. Feature engineering can also be used to create new variables from existing ones, which can improve the model. Finally, use the model predictions to make investment decisions.",
