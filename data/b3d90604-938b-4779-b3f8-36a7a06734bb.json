  "output": "Climate change is having an increasing impact on the global economy. It is estimated that by 2030, the cost of climate change will be between $150 to $300 billion. The sectors that will be the most impacted are agriculture, tourism, and infrastructure. As temperatures rise and extreme weather events become more frequent, crops are damaged, properties are destroyed, and industries are disrupted. Rising sea levels also lead to coastal flooding and the spread of diseases, further adding to economic losses. Additionally, extreme weather events can bring about the forced displacement of millions of people. All of these factors can result in an economic downturn.",
