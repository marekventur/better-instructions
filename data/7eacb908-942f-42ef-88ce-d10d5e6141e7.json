  "output": "Evolution can be likened to a giant game of rock-paper-scissors. Species are constantly trying to top one another as they adapt to their ever-changing environment. Some creatures use their strong exoskeletons for protection, much like a rock that cycles past its opponents. Others use their camouflage to remain hidden and evolve quietly, similar to a paper that wins by surprise. Still, other species excel at agility and movement, slipping by their adversaries with the same finesse as a pair of scissors.",
