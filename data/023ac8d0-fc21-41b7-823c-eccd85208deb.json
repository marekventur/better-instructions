  "instruction": "Create an algorithm for predicting the winner of a sports match.",
  "input": "The two teams playing are Manchester United and Arsenal.",
  "output": "The algorithm should consist of data-driven and statistical models to provide insights into the performance of each team and compare them to reach a conclusion. First, the algorithm should access and analyze match statistics of the two teams such as total wins, goals scored, losses, average goals per match, etc. Additionally, the algorithm can take into account individual player statistics such as goals scored, assists, passes, etc. It should then compare the overall performance of each team and identify key aspects of strengths and weaknesses for each. Based on this analysis, it should also factor in external variables, such as a team's morale, recent injuries, form and more, to reach a prediction. It should then apply a probability model to assign weights to the inputs and calculate a probable outcome - with Manchester United or Arsenal as the winner of the match.",
