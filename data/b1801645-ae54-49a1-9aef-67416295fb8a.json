  "output": "Some of the advantages of using a pre-trained language model include the ability to leverage existing training data which results in faster and more cost effective development, the ability to generate state-of-the-art results for a wide range of tasks, the ability to get more accurate results for rare word types, and the ability to fine-tune models for specific tasks such as speech recognition. Pre-trained language models also make it easier to develop applications by acting as a plug-and-play model for your application. Additionally, pre-trained models are often more interpretable than models trained from scratch.",
