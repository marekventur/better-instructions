  "output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broadest term, referring to the ability of machines to simulate human intelligence. Machine learning is a subset of AI, involving the use of algorithms to analyze data and draw conclusions from it. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, involving the use of neural networks to make more complex predictions than could be done with traditional machine learning algorithms. All three technologies are essential components of modern computing and have the potential to drastically change lives.",
