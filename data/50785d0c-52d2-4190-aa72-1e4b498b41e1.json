  "output": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that focuses on building computer systems that learn by themselves. These systems don\u2019t require explicit programming to create models or perform tasks; instead, they use large datasets to make predictions and automate tasks. By ingesting data and mining patterns, machine learning algorithms can detect complex relationships and iteratively improve their predictive accuracy.",
