  "input": "",
  "output": "Quantum computing works by exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics to store and process information. It uses quantum bits, or qubits, instead of traditional computer bits, which can represent multiple values at once. These qubits are linked to one another using sophisticated mathematical algorithms, allowing for complex computational operations to be performed. By leveraging the principles of quantum entanglement, superposition and interference, quantum computers are able to solve problems much faster than conventional computers.",
