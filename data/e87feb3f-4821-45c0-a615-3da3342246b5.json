  "instruction": "Identify a target audience for a documentary",
  "input": "Documentary: Human trafficking",
  "output": "A potential target audience for a documentary on human trafficking could be school-aged children. As they are more likely to be unaware of the issue and its risks, they are highly vulnerable to become victims or even perpetrators of trafficking. Additionally, this documentary could be used as an educational tool in classrooms to increase awareness and understanding of the issue. It could also be used to plant seeds of empathy and understanding in students.",
