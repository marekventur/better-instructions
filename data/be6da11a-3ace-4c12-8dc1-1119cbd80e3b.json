  "input": "",
  "output": "A blockchain is different from a database in that it is a distributed, immutable ledger of records. Whereas a database is stored centrally and managed by a single entity, a blockchain is owned by multiple entities. Additionally, data stored on a blockchain is encrypted and verified by a network of computers, ensuring its authenticity and integrity, which is not the case for a database.",
