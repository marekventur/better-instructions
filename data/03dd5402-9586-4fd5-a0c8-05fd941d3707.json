  "input": "No input.",
  "output": "Machine learning and artificial intelligence are two related fields of study that both focus on developing computer systems that can carry out tasks without being explicitly programmed. The two are related, but they are not interchangeable. Machine learning is focused on enabling machines to independently learn and improve on the data they are given, whereas artificial intelligence is focused on developing computer systems that can mimic human cognition. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on using algorithms to automate the learning process, while artificial intelligence expands on that to create systems that are able to understand and reason about the data they are given.",
