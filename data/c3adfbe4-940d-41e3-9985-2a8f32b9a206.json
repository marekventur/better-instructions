  "output": "Love is like a butterfly,\nBeautiful and free.\nIt flutters in the sky,\nAn ethereal sight to see.\n\nLove is like a river,\nFlowing strong and wide.\nIt takes what it wants,\nNo matter where one tries to hide.\n\nLove is like a rose,\nIts petals open up and bloom.\nIt fades away with time,\nInto a life of eternal gloom.\n\nLove is like a mountain,\nUnmoving and tall.\nIt stands against the ages,\nWithstanding any storm, heedless of their call.\n\nLove is like a star,\nA twinkling light in the night.\nIt's by our side until the end,\nTo protect and guide us in the twilight.",
