  "output": "To prepare a cup of herb tea, start by bringing a small pot of water to a boil. Then add the desired herbs in to the boiling water, and let the mixture steep for about 5 minutes before straining the tea into a cup. For best results, use a tea infuser to hold the herbs while steeping. Add a bit of honey, sugar, or lemon juice to the tea to enhance the flavor, and enjoy!",
