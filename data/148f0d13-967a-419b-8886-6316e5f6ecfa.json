  "instruction": "How would you describe a law of thermodynamics?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A law of thermodynamics is a fundamental physical principle describing the behavior of energy and matter. For example, the first law of thermodynamics states that energy is always conserved, meaning that the total amount of energy in a system remains constant. The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy, or the amount of disorder in a system, always increases over time, thus leading to a decrease in the overall amount of usable energy in the system.",
