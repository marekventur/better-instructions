  "output": "One creative way to decorate a room with plants is to hang plants on the wall. Get creative with the layout and create an eye-catching pattern by adding different sizes and varieties of plants. If the plants are light enough, you can use nails or hooks for hanging. For heavier plants, use strong adhesive hooks. You can also hang the plants from the ceiling or use shelves to create a natural wall feature.",
