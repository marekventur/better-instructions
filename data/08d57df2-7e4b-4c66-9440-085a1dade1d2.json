  "output": "The biggest risk of information security is data breaches and cyberattacks. Without proper security measures in place, malicious actors can access confidential or sensitive data stored on networks, leading to financial and reputational damage. The unauthorized access and misuse of data can also have a devastating impact on an organization\u2019s operations and customer\u2019s trust. Therefore, organizations should have a comprehensive security policy to protect their data from potential threats.",
