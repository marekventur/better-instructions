  "input": "Vegetarianism is the only way to live a truly ethical life.",
  "output": "This argument is questionable as vegetarianism may not be the only way to live an ethical life. There are many other ways that promote a more ethical lifestyle such as reducing waste, being mindful of consumerism, and eating sustainably. Eating vegetarian may be one way to live a more ethical life, but it is not necessarily the only way to do so.",
