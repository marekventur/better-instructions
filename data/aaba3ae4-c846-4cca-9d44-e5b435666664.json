  "input": "",
  "output": "Performance monitoring and evaluation of a GPT model is typically done by measuring the accuracy of its output. This can be done by comparing the model's output against ground truth data, or by testing its performance on specific tasks designed for the model. Additionally, performance can be measured using metrics such as perplexity (the likelihood of correctly generating a sentence) and precision (the percentage of correctly generated sentences). Other methods of evaluation include human-based tests, such as annotator studies, which allow humans to evaluate the model's accuracy and how well it performs the intended task.",
