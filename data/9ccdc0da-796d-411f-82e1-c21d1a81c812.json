  "input": "",
  "output": "In recent years, the prevalence of social media has revolutionized the way people communicate, interact, and connect with one another. It has allowed people to build networks throughout the world, share their ideas and opinions, and access information in ways that would have been impossible before its advent. However, it has also posed new challenges and had a profound impact on the lives of its users. From creating an unhealthy obsession with comparing oneself to others, to leading to an addiction making it difficult to disconnect, to politics and other divisive issues, social media has had both positive and negative impacts on our lives. All in all, although its effects have been both beneficial and detrimental, its presence and influence are only likely to grow in the coming years.",
