  "instruction": "What is the kinetic energy of an object with a mass of 3kg and a speed of 15m/s?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The kinetic energy (KE) of the object is calculated using the formula KE = 0.5 * mass * speed^2. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the object with a mass of 3kg and a speed of 15m/s is 675 Joules.",
