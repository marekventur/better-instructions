  "output": "There are a number of active measures that can be taken to combat climate change. Individuals can reduce their own carbon footprints by consuming less energy, recycling, and relying more on renewable energy sources. Governments can implement carbon pricing, invest in energy-efficiency programs, and reduce emissions from industry. Businesses and organizations can invest in energy-efficient technologies, utilize renewable energy sources, and offset their emissions by investing in sustainable development projects. We can also incorporate sustainable agricultural practices and support sustainable land management in order to reduce emissions and increase carbon sequestration.",
