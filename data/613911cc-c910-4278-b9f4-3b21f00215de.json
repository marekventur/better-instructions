  "input": "Noinput",
  "output": "A friend's act of kindness can be seen in many ways. They can offer a helping hand with any problems you may have, lend an ear to listen when you need it, or simply provide their presence when you need it most. The kindness of a friend is something that can never be replaced; it is a gift that reinforces the bonds of friendship.",
