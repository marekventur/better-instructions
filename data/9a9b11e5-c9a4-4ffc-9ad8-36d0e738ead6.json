  "instruction": "Explain the implications of the given information.",
  "input": "A recent study suggests that teenagers are spending too much time on social media.",
  "output": "The implications of this study are clear: Teenagers are prioritizing social media over other aspects of their lives, such as socializing, studying and exercising. This could lead to negative mental health effects such as depression and anxiety, as well as physical health harms such as weight gain and social isolation. It is therefore important that parents, teachers, and other adults help teenagers to learn how to manage their online time in a healthy and balanced way.",
