  "input": "",
  "output": "The scientific method involves making an observation or identifying a problem, forming a hypothesis or a potential solution, conducting experiments to test the hypothesis, analyzing the data, and forming a conclusion based on the results. This process can be used to solve real-world problems by gathering data, running experiments, and producing reliable outcomes. For example, exploration of a new medical treatment could involve first making an observation, then forming a hypothesis, running experiments to test the potential solution, analyzing the data, and then forming a conclusion.",
