  "output": "Alice had been an adventurous soul since she was just a child, but as she grew older she had to give up on many of her pursuits in order to focus on her career. But one summer, she decided to take a chance and played a dangerous game of chance at a casino on a holiday. She won a large sum of money, but the adrenaline rush left her with an unforgettable memory of the moment and she knew she had to forget it ever happened. \n\nYears later, she had made a good life for herself and was leading a comfortable life. Until one day when she heard a jingle of the casino's music and suddenly remembered the whole casino experience and the feeling of winning it all. She knew she had to immediately put it behind her and forget about it, which she did. But it was still a reminder that she should always be careful with her hard-earned money.",
