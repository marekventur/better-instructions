  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. Human-caused emissions are having a profound impact on our planet, and the effects are becoming increasingly visible as the years pass. Rising global temperatures, large-scale shifts in weather patterns, increases in extreme weather events, and the acidification and warming of oceans are all issues that cannot be ignored any longer. Climate change affects not only the environment, but also the health and wellbeing of humans and all species around the world. It is an urgent issue that must be treated with immediacy, as the consequences of inaction are dire.",
