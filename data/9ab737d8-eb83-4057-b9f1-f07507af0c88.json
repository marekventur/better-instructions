  "output": "Animations can enhance the user experience on a website, making it more interactive and engaging. To add animations to a web page, you'll need to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. \n\nFirst, you'll need to create your animation. You can do this by writing HTML and CSS code that defines the elements and animation you want to use. Once you have the HTML and CSS code in place, you can add JavaScript code to control the animation. This code will define the timeline and keyframes of the animation.\n\nOnce the animation is created and coded, you can add it to your webpage. This can be done by using the HTML <script> tag to add the JavaScript code, or you can use a library such as jQuery or Velocity.js. Additionally, you can use a tool such as Animate.css to add pre-made animations to your webpage. \n\nWith the right code and libraries, you can easily add animations to your webpage and make it more interactive and engaging.",
