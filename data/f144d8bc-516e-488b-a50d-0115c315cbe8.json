  "output": "Animal Farm is a satirical fable about animal rebellion and a critique of totalitarianism. The novel tells the story of a group of animals living on a farm run by humans, who are eventually overthrown by the animals. The book follows the animals as they attempt to construct a society run by animals, and follows the rise and fall of their new leadership. The story is a cautionary tale about the consequences of unchecked power, personalized corruption, and other forms of tyrannical manipulation. In the end, the animals have to come to terms with the fact that they have created a system with the same problems as the one they overthrew.",
