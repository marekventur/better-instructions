  "output": "Cellular respiration and photosynthesis are two processes that take place in the cells of living organisms, but they serve different functions. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down organic molecules, such as glucose, to produce energy. Photosynthesis is a process that uses light energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic molecules such as glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. Although they have different functions, these processes are closely intertwined as the products of one are used as inputs for the other.",
