  "instruction": "Given a scenario, devise a plan to address it.",
  "input": "Your neighbor is hosting a loud party and it's keeping you up.",
  "output": "To address the situation, I would first attempt to talk to the neighbor politely and ask them to keep the volume down. If that fails, I would inform the landlord or the local police to take appropriate action. If I am unable to take those measures, then I would invest in soundproofing materials to minimize the noise coming from the neighbor's side.",
