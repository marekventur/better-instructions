  "instruction": "Using the input provided below, develop a website design that visually displays data.",
  "input": "We recently acquired data from a survey we conducted regarding people's preferences for food delivery.",
  "output": "My proposed website design would incorporate charts, graphs, and other visual elements to display data from the survey. The website design would include an interactive dashboard with interactive graphs and tables that can be used to explore the data in more detail. For example, the dashboard could display bar graphs or pie charts to indicate the percentage of people who prefer food delivery from each company or the average ratings for each company. Additionally, the dashboard could also incorporate a map element to display the geographical spread of survey respondents. This website design would allow for the data to be presented visually, making it easier for users to analyze and understand the results of the survey.",
