  "output": "A small business is being imagined that would bring fresh, homemade baked goods to the local community. The small business would offer a variety of cakes, cookies, pies, donuts, muffins, and other treats, all prepared daily in a small kitchen and delivered to local shops and homes. Future plans to expand the business include creating an online storefront and eventually hosting baking classes and workshops.",
