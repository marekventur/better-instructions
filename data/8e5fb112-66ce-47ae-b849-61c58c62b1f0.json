  "output": "Hey [Friend],\n\nCongrats on graduating! I know it can be overwhelming to start looking for a job, especially in this time of uncertainty. My advice to you is to stay organized and disciplined in your job search.\n\nStart by making a list of companies you are interested in and researching each one thoroughly. Take advantage of online platforms to apply and connect with potential employers. Reach out to your contacts and ask them if they know of open positions. \n\nMake a schedule for yourself and try to allocate at least a couple of hours a day to your job search. You can use this schedule to create a timeline and break down your job search into smaller tasks. This also allows you to track your progress and can help you stay motivated. \n\nGood luck with your search! Feel free to reach out if you ever need help.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",
