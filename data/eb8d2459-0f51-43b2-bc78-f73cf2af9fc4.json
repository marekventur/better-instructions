  "output": "To make battered apple pie, begin by preheating your oven to 350\u00b0F. Peel, core, and slice two large apples, then set aside. In a medium bowl, mix together 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/4 cup of butter, cut into small pieces. Slowly add 2/3 cup of milk and stir until a thick batter forms. Grease a 9-inch pie dish, then spread the batter in the dish. Place the apples in the batter and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. Bake for 40 minutes, then cool before serving.",
