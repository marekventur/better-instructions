  "input": "Raising the minimum wage",
  "output": "Increasing the minimum wage could have a positive impact on the economy. A higher minimum wage would give workers more purchasing power and enable them to spend more money on basic necessities, generating economic activity. Furthermore, research has shown that higher wages lead to reductions in worker turnover, which would save businesses money on the costs associated with hiring and training new employees. Higher wages also give workers more of an incentive to look for higher-paid jobs, helping to fill vacancies for better-paying positions.",
