  "output": "The process of selecting a document from an inverted index involves accessing the index to search for relevant documents. The search query is compared to the inverted index and the documents that contain the words from the query are retrieved. The retrieved documents are then ranked according to relevance and returned to the user. The most relevant documents are selected for further analysis. In order to provide the most relevant documents, parameters such as frequency, location, and document length are taken into account. The relevance score for each document is calculated using these parameters and the documents with the highest relevance score are selected for the user.",
