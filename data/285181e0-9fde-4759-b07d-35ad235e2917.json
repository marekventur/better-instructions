  "input": "",
  "output": "Organic food is produced without the use of pesticides, artificial fertilizers, growth hormones, or genetic modification. It is grown in a way that preserves the environment, with sustainable practices that promote nutrient cycling and soil health. Non-organic food, on the other hand, may be grown with chemicals, pesticides, and fertilizers and often is heavily processed, with some nutrients depleted in the process. Organic food is often fresher and can have more flavor than non-organic food. Additionally, organic food may contain higher levels of vitamins and nutrients than their non-organic counterparts.",
