  "input": "",
  "output": "Capitalism and socialism are two different economic systems. In a capitalist economy, the production and distribution of goods and services are primarily determined by the laws of supply and demand in the market. In a socialist economy, the production and distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by a central government. Capitalism presents more opportunities for innovation and creativity, while socialism encourages more social equity. Capitalism provides more personal freedoms while socialism places restrictions on individual freedoms in pursuit of collective goals.",
