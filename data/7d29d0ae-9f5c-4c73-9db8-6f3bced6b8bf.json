  "output": "A Turing test is an attempt to evaluate a machine's ability to demonstrate intelligence. It is a type of test developed in 1950 by Alan Turing that is commonly used to determine whether an AI (or natural language processing) can display a level of intelligence equal or greater to that of a human. A Turing test typically consists of a judge conversing with a human and a machine via text, with the purpose of determining which is which. If the judge cannot determine which is which, then the machine has successfully passed the Turing test.",
