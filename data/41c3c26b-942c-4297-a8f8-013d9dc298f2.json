  "instruction": "Construct a matrix that provides a comparison between two different products.",
  "input": "The two products are a vacuum cleaner and a robot vacuum cleaner.",
  "output": "A matrix comparing a standard vacuum cleaner and a robot vacuum cleaner would include criteria such ease of use, effectiveness, cost, and noise level. The matrix would rate each criteria on a scale of 1-5 for both products, thus providing a clear comparison between the two products.\n\nVacuum Cleaner | Robot Vacuum Cleaner\n--- | ---\nEase of Use | 4 | 5\nEffectiveness | 4 | 5\nCost | 3 | 4 \nNoise Level | 2 | 1",
