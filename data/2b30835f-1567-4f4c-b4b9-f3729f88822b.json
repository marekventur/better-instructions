  "output": "Global warming is causing the planet to become warmer, resulting in rising sea levels, disappearing glaciers and polar ice caps, and more frequent and intense extreme weather events. It is also leading to an increase in ocean acidity, coral reef destruction, and disruption of natural habitat. Many species are now threatened with extinction due to the global climate crisis.",
