  "output": "Tsar Nicholas II (1868-1918) was the last emperor of Russia. He reigned from 1894 to 1917 and led a tumultuous reign during the rule of the Romanov family. He attempted to grant more rights to the people, but his advice was met with relentless opposition. When he refused to abdicate the throne during the Russian Revolution of 1917, his family was captured and executed by the Bolsheviks. Nicholas II\u2019s reign ended in tragedy, but his legacy as the last tsar of Russia continues to captivate the public imagination.",
