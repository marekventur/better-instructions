  "output": "Piracy in the digital age refers to the unauthorized copying, distribution, and sale of copyrighted material (such as computer software, films, music, and e-books) over the internet. It is typically done for financial gain, or for free distribution on file-sharing websites. Piracy of digital materials is done through a variety of different techniques, from the downloading and sharing of files from a variety of unauthorized sources, to the creation of large networks through which these materials can be easily and quickly distributed. The problem has become an increasingly large one in recent years, leading to the creation of various measures to combat it.",
