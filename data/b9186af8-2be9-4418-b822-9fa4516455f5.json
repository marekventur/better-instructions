  "output": "Wearing a helmet is an important safety measure for bike riders and should always be done whenever you are on your bike. Bike helmets are designed to help protect your head from serious injuries in the event of an accident or fall. The helmet absorbs and disperses impact energy, which prevents it from being transferred to the head and brain. Research has indicated that wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of a fatal head injury by as much as 88%, so it is clear that wearing a helmet can save lives. Furthermore, bike helmets can also protect the face, which can help reduce serious facial injuries. Wearing a helmet is a simple step that can make a huge difference in preventing serious head injuries.",
