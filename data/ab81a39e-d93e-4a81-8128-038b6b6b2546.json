  "instruction": "Devise a feasible plan for a sustainable city.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A sustainable city requires the integration of numerous potential solutions to conserve resources and reduce environmental impacts. These solutions include enforced green practices such as reduced waste, increased recycling and composting, efficient energy and water usage, and green transportation practices. \n\nIn terms of energy, solar panels and wind turbines could be used to generate electricity to power public spaces, as well as fuel electric busses and other green forms of transportation in the city. Alternatively, energy efficient buildings and appliances could be used to reduce energy usage, such as LED lighting, energy efficient appliances and double glazing windows, as well as insulation.\n\nFurthermore, the city should prioritize green waste management solutions, such as improved waste segregation, increased composting efforts and increased recycling. Finally, green infrastructure should be developed and integrated into the city, such as parks and green spaces, to reduce pollution, improve air quality and enhance biodiversity.",
