  "instruction": "Design an algorithm that can be used to detect spam emails.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "This algorithm should be able to detect spam emails based on the content of the email, including identifying key words and phrases, evaluating the email for suspicious links and attachments, looking for signs of spoofed email addresses, and scanning for other suspicious behavior such as previous reportings or complains from users. Additionally, the algorithm should also take into account the email's sender, frequency, format, and context.",
