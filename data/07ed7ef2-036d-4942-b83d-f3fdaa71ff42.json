  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to differentiate between a butterfly and a moth is to look at the antennae. Most butterflies have antennae with knobs at the end, while moths have straight or feathery antennae. Additionally, butterflies are usually more colorful and often rest with their wings folded vertically, while moths tend to blend in with the background and rest with their wings laid flat.",
