  "input": "",
  "output": "The three different classes of neurons in the human brain are interneurons, motor neurons, and sensory neurons. Interneurons are involved in the processing of signals within the brain and act as a relay between sensory neurons and motor neurons. Motor neurons are responsible for the transmission of signals from the brain to muscles, while sensory neurons are responsible for the transmission of external signals to the brain.",
