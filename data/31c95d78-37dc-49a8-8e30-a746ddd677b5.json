  "instruction": "How is Deep Learning different from Machine Learning?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Deep learning and machine learning are both AI-based technologies, but they differ in how they process data. Machine learning relies on numerical data such as structured data or even unstructured data, whereas deep learning takes advantage of layered neural networks to process data. Machine learning algorithms take data sets, recognize patterns, and then output predictions. Deep learning, on the other hand, relies on large sets of data and algorithms related to neural networks which, in turn, draw conclusions from the data via the relationships and similarities between them. Deep learning is deeper and more powerful than typical machine learning algorithms, as it can detect even the most subtle nuances and hidden patterns from data. Additionally, deep learning can be used for more complex tasks, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and autonomous robotics.",
