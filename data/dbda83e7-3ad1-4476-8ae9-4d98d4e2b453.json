  "output": "For a person looking to stay fashionable while protecting their skin from the sun at the beach, the best clothing option would be to opt for light, airy, and breathable materials such as linen, cotton, or hemp. A hat and sunglasses are essential for protecting the face from the sun's harsh rays. Moreover, for extra sun protection, a long-sleeved lightweight cardigan can be worn over a bathing suit or tank top. A pair of sandals or flip-flops is recommended for convenience and comfort, and a beach bag is ideal for carrying all beach gear.",
