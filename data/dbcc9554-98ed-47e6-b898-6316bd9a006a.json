  "input": "",
  "output": "One way of motivating oneself to work on difficult tasks is to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks. Focus on one task at a time and reward yourself with something small when you complete a step, such as listening to your favorite song or taking a break. Additionally, setting goals and creating a timeline can help keep you motivated and on track.",
