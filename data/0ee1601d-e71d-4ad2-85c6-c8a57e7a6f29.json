  "output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, from diagnosis and treatment to drug development. AI-powered technology can be used to more accurately diagnose diseases, analyze images and scans, track health data and develop new drugs that are more effective and have fewer side effects. It can be used to improve patient experience and increase access to healthcare, especially in rural and underserved areas. AI can also assist medical professionals by providing decision support and helping to prevent medical errors. While AI is still in the early stages of development, the potential is there for it to have a significant impact on healthcare in the near future.",
