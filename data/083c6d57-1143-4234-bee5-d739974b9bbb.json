  "input": "",
  "output": "A hermit's lifestyle is one of solitude and self-sufficiency. Hermit's tend to focus on spiritual and personal growth, rejecting material possessions and societal conventions. They spend most of their time in quiet contemplation, spending their days reflecting on the world around them and pursuing spiritual enrichment. Hermit's typically live in small homes deep in the woods, often living off the land and crafting basic items that they need. They often prefer to live in vibrant and isolated locations to remain at peace.",
