  "output": "Life is a roller coaster, \nFull of laughter and tears. \nEndless possibilities,\nIn each and every year. \n\nThe ups, the downs, the loops,\nThe dizzy and the spins,\nThe unexpected feelings,\nOf all life's infinite wins. \n\nSometimes a feeling of joy,\nSometimes a feeling of pain.\nSometimes you climb so high,\nAnd sometimes it all seems in vain. \n\nLife can be a mystery,\nI guess that's why they say,\nGo with the flow and embrace it,\nLet each day lead the way.",
