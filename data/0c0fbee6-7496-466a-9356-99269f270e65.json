  "input": "",
  "output": "My ideal virtual assistant would be able to manage calendar events and reminders, as well as schedule meetings with other people. It should be able to take notes and store important documents. I would also like for it to be able to track my tasks, prioritize my to-do lists, and even research topics for me when necessary. It should also be able to interact with other smart devices like my phone, television, and lighting systems. Finally, I would like the virtual assistant to be sensitive and responsive to my needs.",
