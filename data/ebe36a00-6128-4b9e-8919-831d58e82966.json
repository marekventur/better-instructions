  "input": "",
  "output": "I propose a customer segmentation model that uses predictive analytics to group customers into distinct segments. The model will consider factors such as customer demographics, purchase history, website browsing data, and other customer data sources. The model will identify common trends, patterns, and behaviors among customers, and these insights can then be used to create personalized marketing campaigns, tailor product offerings, and optimize customer service.",
