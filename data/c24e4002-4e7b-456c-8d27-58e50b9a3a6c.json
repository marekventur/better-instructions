  "output": "Hamsters are an ideal pet choice; they are incredibly cute, social, and relatively low-maintenance. Plus, they require a small cage and can thrive on a diet of vegetables, fruits, and specially formulated kibble. Hamsters also make great companions for children, as they are friendly, curious, and will happily sit with their human for hours.",
