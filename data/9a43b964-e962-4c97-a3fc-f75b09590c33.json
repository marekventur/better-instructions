  "output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to help people with disabilities in a variety of ways. AI-enabled devices can use speech recognition technology to allow people with limited mobility to interact with computers. AI applications can also utilize computer vision algorithms to allow people to better interpret their environment. Additionally, AI can provide assistance with daily tasks such as navigating public transportation or reading texts. Finally, AI can be used to identify and provide more personalized support for people with disabilities, such as helping with job searches or providing more tailored healthcare advice.",
