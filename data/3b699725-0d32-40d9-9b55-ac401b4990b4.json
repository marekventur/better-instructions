  "output": "A great Halloween costume for a 10-year-old is a superhero. Costume accessories can include a cape, mask, gloves, and boots. They can also accessorize with a utility belt and props like light-up swords or laser guns. If they want something a bit more mythical, they can be a wizard, complete with a robe and wand, or even an alien with a space helmet and a face paint mask.",
