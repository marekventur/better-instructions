  "output": "One easy activity that everyone can do to help the environment is to reduce their energy consumption. This can be done by making sure to turn off lights and electronics when not in use, using less water when showering and doing laundry, and using energy efficient appliances. Another thing people can do is reduce the amount of waste they produce by using reusable products and properly disposing of items that can't be recycled or reused. Finally, people should also make an effort to use public transportation and carpool more to reduce their carbon footprint.",
