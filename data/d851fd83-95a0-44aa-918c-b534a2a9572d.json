  "output": "John had always been an ordinary person. He worked hard but never seemed to get ahead. He was content with his life but wished for more. One night, he had a strange dream. In it, he discovered an ancient map that led to a treasure. He saw himself sailing across a great ocean and finding a hidden island with a pile of gold and jewels.\n\nWhen he woke up, he knew that he had to follow his dream. He quit his job, sold all of his possessions, and set out on a great adventure. With a lot of luck, he found the island and the treasure. Finally, he was a rich man.\n\nJohn used his wealth to do many good things. He built a school for children in the poorest neighborhoods, established a local hospital, and donated to a number of charities. His life had changed drastically because of his dream and he was proud of the difference he was making in the world.",
