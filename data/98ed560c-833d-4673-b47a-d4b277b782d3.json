  "input": "",
  "output": "Online education and traditional education both offer unique benefits. Traditional education tends to create more of a structured learning environment with classes that meet in physical spaces and have a more intimate connection between professors and students. Online education on the other hand allows students more flexibility with course schedules and a more individualized approach to learning with the ability to focus on topics of interest. Both methods also offer audio and visual content, as well as access to course materials, forums, and other students.",
