  "instruction": "Create an algorithm to determine the shortest route from point A to point B.",
  "input": "Point A - (1,1), Point B - (6,7)",
  "output": "The algorithm would first determine the Euclidean distance between Point A and Point B, which is 8. It would then calculate the shortest path between the two points, taking into account obstacles, landmarks and other considerations. The algorithm would then outputs the optimal path between Point A and Point B.",
