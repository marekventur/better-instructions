  "input": "",
  "output": "The industrial revolution and the digital revolution were two major shifts in the way goods were produced, consumed and distributed. The industrial revolution led to a shift from manual production to more automated forms of production, while the digital revolution changed the way data was collected, used, and shared. The industrial revolution was driven by new sources of energy, mechanization, and increased productivity and trade, while the digital revolution was driven by the development of computing technologies and the internet. The industrial revolution led to an increase in production, the growth of cities, and the rise of the middle and working classes. The digital revolution has created new socioeconomic opportunities, increased access to information, and opened up new markets for goods and services.",
