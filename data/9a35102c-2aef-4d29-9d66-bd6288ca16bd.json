  "input": "4000 lbs of goods, shipping time is 10 days, shipping cost must not exceed $5000",
  "output": "The most cost effective way to ship these goods from China to the United States would be to send them by ocean freight with a consolidator, as this will provide the best balance between cost, time and reliability. The estimated cost for shipping 4000 lbs for 10 days is about $3000-$4000, which is well under the stated budget of $5000.",
