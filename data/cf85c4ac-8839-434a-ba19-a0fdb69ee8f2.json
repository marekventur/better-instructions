  "input": "",
  "output": "AI is an umbrella term used to describe computer systems that demonstrate human-level intelligence and are capable of accomplishing complex tasks, while machine learning is a type of AI that leverages algorithms to learn from and improve upon the data it is given. AI and machine learning both involve the use of algorithms to automate tasks and make decisions, but AI is more general and is used to also describe systems that possess general intelligence, while machine learning is more specific and focuses on the use of algorithms to learn and make decisions.",
