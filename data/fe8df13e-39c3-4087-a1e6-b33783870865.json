  "input": "",
  "output": "When carbon dioxide (CO2) is released into the atmosphere, it acts as a blanket that traps heat from the sun. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect, and it is the primary cause of global climate change. Increasing levels of CO2 can lead to higher temperatures and rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and changes in global precipitation patterns. These changes can affect water availability, food security, human health, and lead to increased global poverty.",
