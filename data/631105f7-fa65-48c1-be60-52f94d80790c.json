  "input": "",
  "output": "Zero gravity is the condition of weightlessness experienced while in freefall. In zero gravity, there is no sensation of weight because the gravitational force from the earth is completely canceled out by the equal and opposite force of freefall. When in freefall, gravity will pull on any object equally, regardless of its mass or density.",
