  "output": "The main difference between an AI model and a Machine Learning Model is the scope of tasks they are designed to complete. AI models are made to mimic human intelligence in order to solve problems autonomously and is more advanced when it comes to decision making. Machine Learning models are usually used to interpret large datasets made up of many detailed variables and to make predictions based on them. AI is often underpinned by Machine Learning, but provides a more complex, human like thinking capability, while Machine Learning is more focused on analyzing data and providing a prediction or result.",
