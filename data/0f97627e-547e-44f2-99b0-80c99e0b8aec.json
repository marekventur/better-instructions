  "input": "",
  "output": "The cost of refurbishing a 100-year old Victorian house can vary depending on the size of the house, the extent of the work needed, and the quality of materials being used. Generally, the cost of refurbishing a Victorian house can range from $30,000 to $150,000 or more. Some specific tasks that could be included in a refurbishment project are replacing outdated electrical wiring, updating plumbing, replacing or restoring woodwork, weatherizing walls and windows, replacing roofing, and correcting any structural issues. Additionally, cosmetic tasks such as repainting, staining, or refinishing can further increase the cost.",
