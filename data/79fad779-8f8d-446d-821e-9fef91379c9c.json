  "input": "",
  "output": "A mirage is a naturally occurring atmospheric optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. It is most commonly seen on hot days, when a distant object appears to shimmer above the horizon. It is caused by the refraction of light trough layers of air at different temperatures, creating an optical illusion.",
