  "input": "",
  "output": "To debug an AI model, I would first identify the problem by looking at the evaluation metric, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Once I have identified which metric is not meeting the desired level, I would analyze the data to see what kind of errors the model is making. After this, I would examine the model and any associated code for errors. Finally, I would use various tools and techniques, such as hyperparameter tuning, to further refine and improve the model.",
