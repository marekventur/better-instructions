  "input": "",
  "output": "Neurons are electrically excitable cells responsible for transmitting signals, while glial cells are supportive non-excitatory cells that provide structural and metabolic support to neurons. Additionally, neurons generally have long axons and several short dendrites, while glial cells may have short projections, but do not conduct electrical signals.",
