  "instruction": "Implement a binary search algorithm to find a given number in a sorted array.",
  "input": "Sorted Array = [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12]\nNumber to search = 8",
  "output": "The algorithm should first check the middle element (7). Since 8 is greater than 7, the algorithm should discard the left part of the array and search for 8 in the right part of the array [8, 10, 12]. Then it should check the middle element which is 10 and discard the right part of the array as 8 is smaller than 10. Finally, it will check the last element which is 8 and return the index where 8 is found i.e., 4.",
