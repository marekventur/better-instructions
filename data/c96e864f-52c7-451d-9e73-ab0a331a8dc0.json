  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a 13-year-old named Jason who was fascinated by the power of technology. In a time before AI, he was particularly smitten with computers. He pored over the endless possibilities of programming, tinkering with whatever he could find, and spent every spare minute seeking out new technology to explore.\n\nOne day, he stumbled across something extraordinary. It was a machine he'd never seen before that seemed almost alive. He soon realized it was an AI that could learn. Excitedly, he dove into its code and found a deep, untouched world.\n\nHe determinedly brushed up on his programming skills and began teaching the AI to do amazing things. Before long, the AI was making his tasks easier and even doing things that hadn't been possible before. Soon enough, Jason had even made $$ by winning hackathons and competing in programming competitions.\n\nJason was amazed at the potential of technology and the crucial role it had played in his success as a young coder. He was determined to use his newfound knowledge to help the world and create even more opportunities for himself in the future.",
