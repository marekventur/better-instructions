  "input": "",
  "output": "A double taxation agreement is an agreement between two countries to avoid taxing in the same income both in the country of origin and in the country where the income is earned. This agreement determines which country has the right to levy a tax on the income and in which form (direct or indirect taxation). This prevents double taxation and assures that the same income is not taxed more than once.",
