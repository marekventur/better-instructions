  "input": "The word for word repetition of a section of dialogue, especially the first one, is a common feature in television commercials. It's a strategy often used to emphasize the point that's being made and to give the audience time to really process the message. The repetition can also be used to make sure the audience is really paying attention and deter them from tuning out or changing the channel. The use of a specific phrase in this way facilitates memorization as it is an indication to the viewer that this point is important.",
