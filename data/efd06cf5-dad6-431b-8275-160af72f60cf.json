  "output": "Being a student in my high school French class has been an illuminating experience. Before taking this class, I had only a basic understanding of French grammar, but since then I have become much more confident in my abilities. The lessons have been interesting and engaging, and I have been able to practice my comprehension and production of the language. The teacher is knowledgeable and patient, and I always look forward to Thursdays when the class meets.",
