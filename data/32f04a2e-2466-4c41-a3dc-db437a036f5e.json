  "input": "",
  "output": "Once a successful entrepreneur, this character's life is now in gradual decline. They have seen the wealth, influence and power they used to enjoy slip away, and despite their best efforts, they can't seem to gain back the success they once had. They try to put on a brave face, but everyone can see that underneath their facade of optimism, they are overwhelmed by feelings of sadness and loss.",
