  "output": "A valid will is an important legal document that ensures that one's wishes are taken into consideration in the event of their death. It allows one to specify exactly how they want their finances and possessions to be distributed after their death, as well as any other instructions they may want to leave behind. Having a valid will can also ensure that any legal processes to be undertaken after one's death are accomplished in an efficient, economical, and above all, stress-free manner, both for oneself and one's loved ones.",
