  "instruction": "Write a creative poem, with no less than 24 lines, about a turtle.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Slowly and steadily he moves along,\nThe steady steps of the turtle strong.\nThrough sun and rain, the turtle perseveres,\nNo matter what nature throws his way\n\nWherever he goes, he leaves behind\nA small pattern mapped in his mind.\nSearching the world without pause or speed,\nFollowing the world's hidden needs.\n\nComforting those found in despair,\nHelping the lonely in their despair.\nThrough nights of fear and days of pain,\nAway from the worries of life he gains.\n\nAnd though some may mock his slow steps,\nIt still serves a purpose found in depths\nFor only with patience can the true change be seen,\nThe need for patience oft burned in dreams.\n\nWith no destination nor time at stake,\nHe meanders down the path he takes.\nListening to himself alone,\nThe turtle makes his way home.",
