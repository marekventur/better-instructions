Meanwhile, a student that she had previously tutored, Alex, was also in the library trying to find a book for a project. \n\nSuddenly, Alex spotted Ms. Yang and immediately thought of the help she had given him before. Excitedly, he rushed up to her and warmly greeted her. \n\nMs. Yang was surprised to have seen Alex, and asked him what he was doing in the library. He told her about the project he and his classmates were working on, and that he was looking for a book pertaining to the subject. \n\nMs. Yang was pleased to see him be so passionate about his studies and promised to lend him the book that he needed. The two had a pleasant conversation while they searched through the shelves, before heading their separate ways. \n\nAlex was so thankful for Ms. Yang's help, and it was moments like these that made him realize how invaluable his teachers were.",
