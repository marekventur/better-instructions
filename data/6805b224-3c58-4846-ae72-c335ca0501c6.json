  "input": "",
  "output": "The classification of organisms is based on the characteristics that organisms share such as their cell structure, body plans, and other physical characteristics. Organisms are categorized into six broad taxonomic ranks: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, and genus. Species are categorized into specific taxonomic categories as well. For example, a dog is a mammal, Felis domesticus, that is classified into the kingdom Animalia, the phylum Chordata, the class Mammalia, the order Carnivora, the family Felidae, and the genus Felis.",
