  "input": "",
  "output": "A transportation technology that could revolutionize the way we travel is automated flying cars. Automated flying cars use advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to fly riders to their destinations, eliminating the need for drivers or pilots. Autonomous drones could also be used to transport goods and materials. This technology would significantly reduce travel time and energy expenditure, and open up more possibilities for travel.",
