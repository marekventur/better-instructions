  "instruction": "Give an example of a creative way to use GPT models.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One creative way to use GPT models is to generate new stories and universes. GPT language models can generate new narrative plots, character profiles, and environments that can be used to create stories, films, and even video games. For example, one of the potential applications is to create a new film universe with its own timeline, characters, and settings. By providing a set of starter prompts, GPT models can generate new plots, storylines, and characters that can be further developed into full-fledged stories or films.",
