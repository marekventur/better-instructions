Generosity! \nDawn of a brighter day \nYour power so serene\nIn the hearts of all men\n\nYour beauty lies in giving\nFrom the depths of one's soul\nHelping others in need\nFrom one's own control\n\nYour grace is boundless\nYour spirit full of fire\nYour goodness always\nRadiates with desire\n\nOh! Generosity! \nYou are the hope of mankind\nBringing love and joy\nTo ease one's mind\n\nYour radiant light\nShines eternal day\nCasting away the shadows\nTo lead the way",
