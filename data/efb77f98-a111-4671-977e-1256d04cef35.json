  "input": "",
  "output": "Hawks and falcons are both birds of prey, but there are a few differences between them. Hawks tend to have broader wings and beak, and fly at lower altitudes than falcons. Falcons tend to be more agile in flight and have a curved beak. Additionally, while hawks are usually found in wooded or agricultural areas, falcons tend to prefer open habitats.",
