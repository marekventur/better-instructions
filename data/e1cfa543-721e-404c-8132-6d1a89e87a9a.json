  "input": "Noinput",
  "output": "Using public transportation is an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Taking public transportation to work, shopping, and school can reduce single-occupancy vehicular accidents, as well as traffic congestion, which can help save money on fuel costs and get people to their destinations faster. Taking public transportation also helps people save time, as they don\u2019t have to spend time looking for parking spots. It can also save money, as taking public transportation is often much cheaper than taking a cab or car. Additionally, taking public transportation can help build stronger communities by providing an easy means of socializing with others. Young people should take advantage of the opportunities that public transportation provides and make a positive contribution to society.",
