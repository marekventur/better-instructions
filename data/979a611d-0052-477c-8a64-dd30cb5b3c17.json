  "input": "Advertising should be allowed in schools.",
  "output": "Advertising should be allowed in schools, as it is a way for schools to generate further income to invest in educational opportunities for its students. For example, many schools lack the funds to purchase much-needed resources such as books and computers, but with the help of advertising, schools could use the financial gains from the advertisements to make these resources available. Additionally, advertising gives companies the opportunity to promote their products and services to the school's demographic, thereby providing value to both the school and the company. Further, it allows companies to give back to the school, as companies may have sponsorship programs or offer discounts for school-related activities. Therefore, allowing advertising into schools can provide benefits for all involved.",
