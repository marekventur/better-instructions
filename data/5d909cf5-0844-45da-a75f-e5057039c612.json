  "output": "Two popular social media sites, Facebook and Twitter, have some similar features, such as the ability to post and share content, comment on posts/tweets, and interact with other users. However, they also have differences. On Twitter, users are limited to 280 characters per tweet, whereas Facebook users have no character limit.
