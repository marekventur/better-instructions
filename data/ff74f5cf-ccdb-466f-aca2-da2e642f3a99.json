  "output": "Once upon a time, a tiny field mouse was struggling to find food after a long and dry summer. Then, one day, the mouse stumbled upon a large patch of sweet and juicy berries. The mouse eagerly rushed to fill its belly\u2014until she noticed a figure in the distance. \n\nIt was an old bear, sleeping soundly under a tall tree. The mouse was terrified, but she could not resist the temptation of the sweet berries. She gathered as many as she could in her tiny paws, and quickly ran away in the opposite direction. \n\nBut the Bear woke up and yelled, \u201cHey! Aren\u2019t those my berries you\u2019re taking?\u201d \n\nThe mouse, realizing her mistake, stopped in her tracks. She thought long and hard before she admitted her mistake and offered the bear some of the berries that she had taken. Impressed by the mouse\u2019s honesty, the bear gave her a reward\u2014a big chunk of cheese. \n\nThe moral of the story is: Honesty is always the best policy.",
