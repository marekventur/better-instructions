  "input": "",
  "output": "Autonomous vehicles can provide more efficient transportation by using sensors, artificial intelligence and advanced software to identify obstacles and plan routes and optimize traffic patterns. Autonomous vehicles also reduce the need for parking spaces as they can drop off passengers and return to pick up other passengers without having to park. Additionally, autonomous vehicles can increase the capacity of roads and highways by operating more closely together and reducing driver errors which can result in collisions.",
