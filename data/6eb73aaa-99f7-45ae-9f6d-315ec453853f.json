  "instruction": "Create an algorithm to identify whether two strings are anagrams.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm could take two strings as inputs and returns true if they are anagrams and false if they are not. To do this, we could take each string, convert it to a sorted array of characters, and then compare the arrays. If the arrays are identical, then the strings are anagrams, and we would return true, otherwise false.",
