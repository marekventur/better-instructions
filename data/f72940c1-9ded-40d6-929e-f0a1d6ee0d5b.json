  "output": "Amar and Akhil were the best of friends. They had grown up together in the same small village in the heart of the Indonesian jungle. With deep banyan roots, the boys had many of the same dreams and aspirations. \n\nOne day, the morning sun dawned beautiful and bright. The boys headed off for fishing with their boats and nets newly bought, in hopes of a great day\u2019s yield. But shortly after setting off, a tsunami roared over the horizon, engulfing the sea and the shoreline in its raging wrath. \n\nThe boys were thrown apart by the tumultuous waters and washed away. It wasn\u2019t long before they woke on separate beaches, miles from their village, bewildered, bruised and battered. \n\nThough they both shouted out in unison, their calls were lost in the churning of the sea. They were separated, but the boys still held on to the hope of reuniting amid the aftermath of the disaster.",
