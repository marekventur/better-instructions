  "output": "Snow White's daughter, Rose Red, was as beautiful as her mother, with skin as pale as snow and lips as red as roses. She had the same love for animals as her mother and was always eager to help them in times of need. Like Snow White, Rose Red was kind and generous, and always put the needs of others before her own. She was also brave and adventurous, and often joined her mother in the forest to explore and discover new wonders. Whenever Snow White needed her, Rose Red was always there to help.",
