  "input": "",
  "output": "I can make an old sweater into something new by cutting and refashioning it. For example, I can cut off the sleeves and turn the body of the sweater into a skirt. I can also add a panel of faux fur at the bottom of the skirt for a modern look. I can cut the sleeves into strips, turn them into a patchwork quilt pattern, and attach the patchwork pieces to a tote bag. I can also repurpose the pieces of the sweater into a knit hat, arm warmers or leg warmers.",
