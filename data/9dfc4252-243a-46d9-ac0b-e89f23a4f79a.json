  "output": "Autonomous cars, also known as self-driving cars, are cars that are capable of driving themselves with little or no human intervention. Autonomous cars use sensors, cameras, artificial intelligence, and advanced algorithms to help them navigate and safely operate on public roads. Recent advancements in autonomous car technology has made them increasingly reliable and efficient, though there are still some regulatory and technical issues to overcome before they become practical for everyday use. There have been recent test runs that have shown great results, and experts believe that autonomous cars will become a reality within the next decade.",
