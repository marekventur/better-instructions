  "output": "The most common features of an optical microscope include a light source, an objective lens, a condenser lens, an eyepiece, a stage, a coarse focus and a fine focus adjustment knob. The light source is usually a bulb but can also be a laser. The objective lens is the lens closest to the sample and it magnifies. The condenser lens focuses the light onto the sample and the eyepiece magnifies the sample further. The stage holds the sample and is adjustable for focusing the sample. The coarse and fine focus knobs are for focusing the image.",
