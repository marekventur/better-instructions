We need to take action now!\u201d \nCharacter 2: \u201cI don't think we can rely on government policies to fix the problem, we need to take an individual approach. We could all start by consuming fewer resources and less energy.\u201d \nCharacter 1: \u201cBut it's not just individual actions that will make a difference. We need to focus on policy implementation, in order to make significant progress and tackle the root cause.\u201d \nCharacter 2: \u201cClearly, it's not going to be an easy path, but we have no choice but to start somewhere.\u201d",
