  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary difference between interactive and non-interactive user interfaces is that interactive user interfaces allow users to interact with, and manipulate, elements on the interface, while non-interactive user interfaces do not allow for user interaction. Interactive user interfaces typically include elements like buttons, sliders, and forms that allow users to input and control information, while non-interactive user interfaces are typically static and do not allow users to control information or interact with elements on the screen.",
