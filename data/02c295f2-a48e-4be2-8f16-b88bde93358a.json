  "output": "The ocean is a wondrous thing, \nIts depths untold and secrets hidden within.\nA mystery that spans time and space,\nA beautiful sight that can never be erased.\nIt calms us with its endless lull,\nA serene and majestic lull.\nAs sunlight dances upon its waves,\nWe can no longer be slaves.\nTo the rhythm of the undulating sea,\nWe can be forever free.",
