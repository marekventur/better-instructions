  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Communism seeks to create an economic system in which wealth and power are shared among the members of society, potentially leading to a more equitable distribution of resources. \n2. Under communism, incentives to work hard and innovate would be provided through job security and the promise of a wider social safety net. \n3. Communism emphasizes collective responsibility that allows people to work together on initiatives and projects, with each person\u2019s unique talents and knowledge benefiting the whole. \n4. Communism could lead to a less hierarchical society, potentially increasing freedom and reducing the oppressive structures and power dynamics created by other forms of government.",
