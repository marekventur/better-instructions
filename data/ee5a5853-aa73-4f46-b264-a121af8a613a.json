  "input": "",
  "output": "A tsunami and a tidal wave are both large ocean waves generated by some type of disturbance in the water. The main difference between the two is that a tsunami is a result of a sudden displacement of water, usually caused by an underwater earthquake, landslide, or volcanic eruption. A tidal wave, on the other hand, is formed by the gravitational pull of the moon and usually occurs near coastline areas near the full moon. Tsunamis are usually more powerful and destructive than tidal waves, as they move faster and higher up the shoreline.",
