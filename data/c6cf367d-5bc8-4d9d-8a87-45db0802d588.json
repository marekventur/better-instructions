  "instruction": "How would you explain the concept of a 'memory leak' to someone with no background in computing?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A memory leak is something that happens in computer programming when a program allocates memory for a certain purpose, but the memory never gets released, even after it is no longer needed. This is similar to a person who rents a space for a day, but then leaves the furniture and other items in the space for weeks, even though the space is no longer being used. Over time, this can slow down the computer, decrease its performance, or even cause it to crash.",
