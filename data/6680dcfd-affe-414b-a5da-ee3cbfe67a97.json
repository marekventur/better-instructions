  "output": "Political philosophy is a branch of philosophy which studies the meaning and purpose of politics, law, and the state. It helps to understand the origin, nature, and limits of political power. Political ideology, on the other hand, is a set of beliefs and values held by an individual or political party. Ideologies provide a foundation for political action and are integrated into a system of ideas which explain how the world should be organized. Political ideologies can be based on a range of values such as individualism, freedom, equality, or justice.",
