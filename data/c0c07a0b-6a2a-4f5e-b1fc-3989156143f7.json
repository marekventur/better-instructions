  "input": "",
  "output": "Dolphins are incredibly intelligent due to their large and complex brains. Dolphin brains are proportionally much larger when compared to the brain size of other marine mammals and are considered to be among the most intelligent animals on the planet. Dolphins communicate using complex vocalizations, use tools such as sponges to protect their beaks, and are capable of complex problem solving behaviors. Studies have shown that dolphins are capable of recognizing gestures, individual humans, and even learning human languages.",
