  "input": "",
  "output": "In computer science, complexity refers to the amount of resources required to solve a problem. It is often measured by the amount of time, memory, or processing power necessary to complete a task. Complexity can also measure the amount of effort or sophistication needed to design a solution for a problem. The complexity of a problem or solution is usually based on the size and structure of the data set, number of steps, and number of possible outcomes.",
