Drones with advanced cameras allow photographers and filmmakers to capture stunning, high quality images from levels that would otherwise be difficult to reach. Another popular application is delivery and logistics. Companies such as Amazon and UPS have begun using drones to deliver packages to customers in an efficient and timely manner.
