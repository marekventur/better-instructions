  "input": "",
  "output": "Using visualization for data analysis helps to quickly identify patterns, outliers and correlations in the data. It can be used to better communicate and explain complex relationships that exist in the data and provide more comprehensive insights. Visualization also makes understanding complex data sets more intuitive, and enables the user to more easily draw the necessary conclusions. This is particularly important when analyzing large, highly dimensional datasets.",
