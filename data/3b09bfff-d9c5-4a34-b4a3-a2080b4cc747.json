  "input": "A Study of Photosynthetic Efficiency Under Different Light Conditions",
  "output": "This paper studied the effect of light intensity on the photosynthetic efficiency of an organism. The research was conducted over several experiments with different light intensities, with the results indicating that photosynthetic rates decreased as light intensity increased. The paper concluded that light intensity strongly affects photosynthetic efficiency and should be taken into consideration when studying an organism's environment.",
