  "input": "\"<noinput>\"",
  "output": "Solving a problem and debating a topic involve different processes and approaches. When solving a problem, the focus is typically on analyzing and finding a practical or effective solution. This is usually done through logical means, such as exploring causes and consequences, analyzing facts and figures, and applying existing knowledge. On the other hand, debating a topic entails considering the argument from multiple perspectives, evaluating the possible outcomes and evaluating which side of the argument is stronger. When debating a topic, the focus is on making an effective argument, weighing the pros and cons, and using persuasive rhetoric.",
