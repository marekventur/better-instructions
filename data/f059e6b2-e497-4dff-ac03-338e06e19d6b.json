This profile should be optimized for search engine results when employers look for job candidates. \n\n2. Research potential employers and job opportunities. Utilize job search engines, such as Indeed or Monster, to find employers and job postings. Alternatively, research companies you are interested in and reach out to recruiters or Human Resources departments directly.\n\n3. Create a portfolio. Create a portfolio website, and include relevant projects, articles, and other professional documents. Share your portfolio with potential employers and make sure to keep it updated.
