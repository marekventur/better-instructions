  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial intelligence is expected to have a considerable impact on the social landscape. It could have implications for how people find jobs, access education, interact with each other and make decisions. AI has the potential to reduce human labour and provide new and more efficient ways to interact with the world. It might also lead to increased automation and eradication of existing roles causing disruption to traditional economic models and forcing people to look for different job opportunities. AI might also be able to better detect patterns in a plethora of data faster than humans, enabling new technologies to emerge faster than ever. So, AI has the potential to revolutionize the way people live and interact with each other.",
