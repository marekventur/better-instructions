  "input": "",
  "output": "The European Union (EU) is an economic and political union of 27 member states located primarily in Europe. The EU had a population of almost 450 million people in 2020 and a gross domestic product of over 19 trillion euros. The primary goal of the EU is to promote economic growth and social progress. It has achieved this through the implementation of various policies, such as the free movement of goods, services and people, as well as enhanced cooperation in areas such as foreign, security and defense policy. Additionally, the EU has implemented measures to promote environmental protection, scientific research, and development. In recent years, the EU has become increasingly divided due to the financial crisis, Brexit, and the rise of populist leaders and parties, leading to an uncertain future for the union.",
