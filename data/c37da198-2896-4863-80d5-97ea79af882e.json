  "output": "This vegan chocolate cake is perfect for all vegan eaters. The recipe calls for dairy-free substitutes like almond milk, vegan butter, and vegan chocolate chips. The cake itself is made with all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder, and dark brown sugar. To make it vegan, simply replace the eggs with a flax egg, replace the butter with vegan margarine, and use almond milk instead of regular milk. If desired, you can also add some dairy-free cream cheese frosting for an irresistible treat.",
