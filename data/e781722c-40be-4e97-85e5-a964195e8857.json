  "input": "",
  "output": "The two characters are a police officer and a teacher. The police officer is a strict, by the book type, who believes in the letter of the law. The teacher is a more laid back, compassionate individual, who feels that understanding and empathy are better values than punishment. The two are in conflict because the police officer sees the teacher as too lenient and the teacher thinks the police officer is too harsh.",
