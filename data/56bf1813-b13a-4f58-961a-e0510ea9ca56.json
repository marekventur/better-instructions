  "input": "",
  "output": "The two major advantages of using a GPT model compared to traditional programming are its natural language understanding capabilities and its ability to generate new, compelling outcomes based on inputs. Traditional programming is restrictive as it is limited to a predetermined set of outcomes based on conditions set by the programmer. However, GPT models are able to generate new outcomes based on the input it receives, removing the need for predefined programming logic. Additionally, GPT models understand natural language, giving it the ability to respond to more complex user queries instead of relying on rigid keyword-based programming.",
