  "output": "One solution to help reduce the negative effects of plastic on the environment is to move towards sustainable forms of packaging such as paper, glass, and compostable materials. Additionally, governments and businesses can work together to create better regulations for manufacturing, using, and disposing plastic products. This could include requiring the use of reusable and recyclable containers, as well as incentivizing people to recycle and properly discard their plastics.",
