  "input": "",
  "output": "Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that share similar characteristics, behaviors, and needs. Companies can use customer segmentation to better understand their target market and tailor their products and services accordingly. For example, a clothing store could use customer segmentation to differentiate between customers who prefer to shop in-store versus those who prefer to shop online. Based on this information, the store could then create tailored marketing campaigns that appeal to each segment of customers.",
