  "input": "",
  "output": "Google and Bing are two of the most popular search engines used today. They have different strengths and weaknesses. Google has a well-developed algorithm that allows it to show better and more accurate results for most searches. It also features dozens of useful features such as autocomplete, image search, and personalized search. However, it does not have the same depth of coverage as Bing, which has a larger database and covers more topics in greater depth. Additionally, Bing's comparison shopping and video search features are superior to Google's, making it a better choice for more specialized information.",
