  "output": "The thick canopy of the rainforest blocked out almost all of the sunlight, leaving the ground in perpetual shade. The air was damp and humid, and the humidity made it feel like the air was thick and viscous. It was as if breathing had become an effort in itself. Even the animals seemed to be holding their breath. Suddenly, a loud crash filled the air, and then all was still.",
