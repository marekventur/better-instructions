  "output": "A meal-planning system could be designed to help users plan healthy, nutritious meals. The system would allow users to input their dietary restrictions, such as vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free or low-carb. The user would then receive recipe suggestions which match their restrictions, along with a grocery list of ingredients for those recipes. \n\nOther features could include nutrition information for the suggested recipes, meal plans for different number of servings, and a meal-tracking system. The system could also be personalized to a user's dietary preferences and require that they rate recipes as they go. This would help the system to better understand their tastes and provide more tailored meal plans.",
