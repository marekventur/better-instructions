  "input": "",
  "output": "A thesis statement is the central argument in a paper and is typically the last sentence in an introduction. It provides direction for a paper, pinpointing the main argument and expressing an opinion about that argument. To write a good thesis statement, define the purpose of your paper and make sure your argument is clear and direct. Also, be sure to make your argument focused and specific, and make sure it's something that can be reasonably argued with evidence. Make sure you aren\u2019t being too broad or narrow in focus and that the statement ties into the main idea of your paper. Finally, the statement should be concise yet informative, explain the central argument, and showcase why your position is worth considering.",
