  "output": "Suppose we let A, B, and C represent the sides of a triangle such that C is the longest side and A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 = C\u00b2. This is the Pythagorean Theorem. If we assume the converse, namely that A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 = C\u00b2 implies C is the longest side, then there is a possibility of a triangle where A > C or B > C. This contradicts the original assumption that C is the longest side of the triangle, therefore proving that the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem is false.",
