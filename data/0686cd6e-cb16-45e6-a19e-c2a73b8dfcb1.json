  "input": "",
  "output": "Web applications and native applications are both types of software applications that are designed to run on a specific platform. Web applications are programs that run in a web browser and require an internet connection to function. Native applications, on the other hand, are applications that are built for a specific operating system (OS) or device and are installed directly on the device. Web applications are typically less expensive and easier to develop, while a native application offers more features and is more performant. Additionally, web applications can be updated without reinstalling or downloading, while native applications require users to update them manually.",
