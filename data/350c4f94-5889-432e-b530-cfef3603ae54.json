  "input": "",
  "output": "Online education is becoming increasingly popular, but there are a number of drawbacks. Many students miss out on the structure and support that a traditional school provides, and while they may be able to work at their own pace, there is also a lack of accountability and guidance. Additionally, a computer and a stable internet connection is required for online courses, which can be hard for some students to access. Furthermore, online classes may lack the same level of engagement and collaboration as classroom-based courses, due to the lack of direct contact between teacher and student.",
