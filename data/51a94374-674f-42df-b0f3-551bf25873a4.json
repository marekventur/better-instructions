  "output": "Creating a game using computer programming requires a few basic steps. First, you need to determine the game's concept, including the genre, setting, structure, main characters and overall design. Then you need to write the code to create the game\u2019s environment, objects, characters, and rules. The next step is to develop the game's user interface, including buttons, menus, and other user-interaction elements. Last, you need to test the game to make sure it works correctly and adjust the code as necessary. Finally, the game can be published and released to the public.",
