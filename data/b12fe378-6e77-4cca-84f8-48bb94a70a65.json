  "input": "",
  "output": "For a diabetic, three safe foods to enjoy are low-fat dairy products, fresh fruits, and non-starchy vegetables. Low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk and low-fat cheese contain essential vitamins and minerals, but are low in sugar. Fresh fruits, like apples, berries, and oranges, are packed with vitamins and provide necessary fuel for the body. Non-starchy vegetables, including spinach, celery, and broccoli, are rich in dietary fiber and can help manage blood sugar levels.",
