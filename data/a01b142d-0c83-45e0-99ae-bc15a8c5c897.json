  "input": "",
  "output": "A bankstatement is important for tracking funds, verifying transactions, and assessing charges. For example, it can be used to track where money has been spent and for what purpose. Additionally, it can be used to view any transactions or charges that may have been made recently, which is especially helpful for monitoring the activity of a shared account. Finally, it provides a record of payments, withdrawals, and deposits that may be needed for tax and other financial purposes.",
