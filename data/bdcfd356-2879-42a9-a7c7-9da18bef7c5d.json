  "instruction": "Suggest an effective marketing strategy for a TV show.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One effective marketing strategy for a TV show is to create a teaser trailer to be released ahead of the show's premiere on television and other digital platforms. The teaser trailer should be short, dynamic, and compelling in order to trigger curiosity and interest in viewers. It should also contain a compelling tag line or \"hook\" that summarizes the show's premise. Additionally, creating a hashtag associated to the TV show and asking viewers to join the conversation on social media will help increase engagement and exposure of the show. Additionally, creating influencer campaigns, running sponsored promotions and contests on social media, and creating original digital content associated to the show will also help increase engagement and create a larger fan base.",
