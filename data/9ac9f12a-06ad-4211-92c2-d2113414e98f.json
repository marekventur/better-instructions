  "instruction": "Imagine you were a professor and you had to grade an essay on the positive effects of globalization.",
  "input": "<no input>",
  "output": "In grading the essay on the positive effects of globalization, I would consider points such as the improvement of labor standards, economics, and access to healthcare. In addition, I would pay attention to how effectively the student includes case studies or other research to back up arguments concerning increased communication, better transportation, and cross-cultural understanding. Lastly, I consider the balance of the student's argument to illustrate both the potential benefits and pitfalls of increased global cooperation.",
