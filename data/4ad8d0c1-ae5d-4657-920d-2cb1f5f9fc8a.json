  "instruction": "Design a hologram of a historical figure.",
  "input": "Winston Churchill",
  "output": "The design of the hologram of Winston Churchill should include a realistic 3D image of him that is capable of speaking and engaging the audience with body language. The hologram should reflect the time period during which he lived and the context that was significant to his life, such as scenes from WWII. The hologram should be accompanied with sound effects such as airplanes, sirens and bombs to make the experience more immersive.",
