  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between blockchain and traditional databases is that blockchain is distributed across a peer-to-peer network, while traditional databases are centrally located. This means that blockchain is more secure, as it is harder to hack, and is more efficient, as it does not require a third-party to validate transactions. Furthermore, blockchain can be used to store digital data, such as cryptocurrency and medical records, while traditional databases are used to store and retrieve structured data, such as customer information or inventory records.",
