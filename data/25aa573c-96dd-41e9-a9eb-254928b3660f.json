  "instruction": "Generate a plausible solution to reduce global carbon emissions.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One solution to reduce global carbon emissions would be to implement a global carbon pricing system. This would give carbon emitters an incentive to reduce their emissions, as they would have to pay a fee depending on how much carbon they emit. This revenue could then be used to fund research into renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, as well as providing subsidies for energy efficiency initiatives. Additionally, this revenue can be used to support communities that have been affected by the switch from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources.",
