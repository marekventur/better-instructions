  "output": "The mountain stood majestic in the morning sun, its peaks proudly pointing towards the sky. Its rocky cliffs glistened with the dew of the morning, and the light danced off its jagged surfaces like the rays of a million stars. Its shadow seemed to stretch for miles, providing a shade in the otherwise harsh midday heat. Wildlife of all sorts could be seen throughout the mountain, scurrying through the brush, flying above the peaks, and chirping amongst the trees. It was a sight to behold, and a testament to the wonders of nature.",
