  "instruction": "Define the process of vectorization.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Vectorization is a process through which matrix operations are optimized to use repeated addition, subtraction, and multiplication instead of loops or iterative equations. This can significantly speed up the computations, especially when dealing with large data sets. Vectorization is commonly used in linear algebra, machine learning, and signal processing algorithms.",
