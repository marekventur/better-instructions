  "input": "",
  "output": "Java and JavaScript are two distinct programming languages that are often confused for each other. Java is a compiled, object-oriented language, while JavaScript is a scripting language. Java is strongly typed and requires the programmer to write classes, while JavaScript is a much simpler language, with a focus on scripting rather than classes. Java is platform-independent, while JavaScript is dependent on the platform it is running on. Java provides built-in support for multithreading, while JavaScript relies on the host environment to provide it. Finally, Java is a language focused on enterprise development, while JavaScript is a language focused on building client-side applications.",
