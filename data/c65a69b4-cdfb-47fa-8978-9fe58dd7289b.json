  "output": "Animal Memory Game:\n\nIn this memory game, players must match pictures of animals with the correct names. The game board consists of cards arranged in a grid, face down. On each card, there is a picture of an animal on one side and its name on the other. Players take turns flipping two cards and attempting to match the animal's picture with its name. If a match is made, the player keeps the pair in front of them. The player with the most pairs at the end of the game wins. \n\nThis game helps to introduce children to animals in a fun and interactive way. It helps promote memory, recognition, and naming skills, as well as encourages good sportsmanship as players take turns and congratulate one another. It can also be modified to increase difficulty by requiring players to match a description of the animals instead of the name.",
