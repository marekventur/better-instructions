  "input": "",
  "output": "The construction of the Three Gorges Dam in China was intended to increase the country\u2019s electricity production and control the massive flooding of the Yangtze River, but it has also had far-reaching economic and social consequences. The dam has caused the displacement of over 1 million people, destruction of wildlife habitats, and has caused the siltation and pollution of the river. It has also increased the cost of electricity, as the costs of construction and maintenance of the dam have been high. Additionally, the economic benefits of the dam have not been divided equally, as the industries and wealthy cities have seen greater economic benefits while rural communities have been left behind.",
