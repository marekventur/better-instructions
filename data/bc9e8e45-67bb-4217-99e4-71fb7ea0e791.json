  "input": "Put up signs around the dangerous area to warn people.",
  "output": "This statement would not be considered an effective safety measure because it does not address the root cause of the danger. While signs could be used to warn people of any potential danger, it does not prevent them from entering the area, or provide any protection against potential harm. Instead, more proactive measures should be taken such as installing barriers or additional security.",
