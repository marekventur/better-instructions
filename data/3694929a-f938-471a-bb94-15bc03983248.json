  "input": "",
  "output": "Five common plants that grow in the desert are cacti, creosote, Joshua trees, mesquite, and yucca. Cacti have adapted to many desert environments and can be found in almost all of them. Creosote is a small shrub that is very hardy and can thrive in arid climates. Joshua trees are native to the southwestern United States and thrive in desert environments. Mesquite is also a small shrub that grows in dry areas and relies on a deep root system to survive. Finally, yucca is a larger flowering shrub that grows in dry deserts and is more common in areas with higher elevations.",
