  "input": "",
  "output": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two particles interact in a way that causes them to remain connected, even over great distances. This means that changes in one particle can instantly affect its partner, regardless of the distance between them. It is like two people who share an entangled relationship regardless of where they are in the world.",
