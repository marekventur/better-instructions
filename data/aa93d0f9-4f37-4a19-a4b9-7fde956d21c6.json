  "output": "The Tiefflopter is an unusual species of creature found in the tropical forests of the Amazon. It stands about a foot and a half tall, resembling a winged squirrel. It has wings that span about three and a half feet, allowing it to soar gracefully through the air for long periods of time. Its body is covered in silky-soft brown fur and its wings are adorned with vibrant, colorful designs. On its head, two long antennae protrude from its forehead, wiggling and bending like a cat\u2019s whiskers as it navigates its environment. Its claws are long and sharp, able to grasp firmly onto the tree branches and other objects it encounters. Finally, its tail is long and feathery, enabling it to balance itself while in flight.",
