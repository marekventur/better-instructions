  "input": "",
  "output": "To improve usability, web interface designs should be intuitive, visually pleasing, and easily navigable. Clear labels and simple menus should be used, and users should be able to access essential functions quickly. Tooltips and hints can be used to provide extra information if necessary, while text should be limited to only the most useful information. All elements should be logically organized and consistent across pages, while the design should aim to be device-responsive.",
