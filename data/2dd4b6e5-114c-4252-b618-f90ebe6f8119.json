  "instruction": "Describe the concept of 'inverse dynamics'.",
  "input": "No input",
  "output": "Inverse dynamics is a branch of mechanics that focusses on predicting the forces and torques in a system. It is the process of determining the forces or torques present in given conditions from a desired motion and the environment's properties. Inverse dynamics can also be used to calculate the unknowns in a given system and uncover the underlying laws of motion. By understanding the interplay of various forces, it provides powerful insight into the control of robots and other dynamic systems.",
