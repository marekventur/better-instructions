  "instruction": "Create an illustration depicting the stages of mitosis",
  "input": "No input",
  "output": "This illustration depicts the four major phases of mitosis: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. In prophase, the chromosomes condense and the nuclear membrane breaks down. In metaphase, the chromosomes align along the metaphase plate. In anaphase, the sister chromatids are separated and pulled toward opposite poles. Lastly, in telophase, two new nuclei form and the nuclear membrane reappears. In between these four stages, cytokinesis occurs, which is the physical division of the cytoplasm. As the cells divide and replicate, the cycle of mitosis is complete.",
