  "output": "Sentiment analysis is a method of analyzing consumer opinions by assigning a numerical score to words and phrases in text data. For example, a sentiment analysis algorithm may assign a score of +1 for each occurrence of the word \"love\" and a score of -1 for each occurrence of the word \"hate\". By summing the scores for each word in a text, the algorithm can give an overall sentiment score, which will be positive if the overall opinion is positive and negative if the overall opinion is negative.",
