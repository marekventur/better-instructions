  "input": "",
  "output": "Open-ended generation is a type of task where the aim is to generate natural language output. This could involve generating a response to a query, summarizing a document, or generation of a description based on an image or video. In comparison, classification is a type of task where the aim is to assign a label or class to a given input. For example, classification could involve classifying a given text as belonging to one of several predefined categories, or classifying an image as being that of a particular animal or object. Open-ended generation tasks typically involve natural language processing, while classification tasks involve machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. In addition, open-ended generation tasks typically involve generating text output, while classification tasks involve assigning labels or classes to input.",
