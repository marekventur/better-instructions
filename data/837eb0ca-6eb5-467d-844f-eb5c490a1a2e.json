  "output": "A bottle opener is a device used to open bottles or cans. In general, it consists of a small metal piece with a handle and a hinged lever arm, located at the inner end of the handle. When the lever arm is pressed against the lip of the bottle or can and the handle is twisted, pressure is applied to the lid, popping it off. Bottle openers come in different shapes, sizes, and materials. They are often designed to hang from a key chain or keyring, making them easy to store and carry with you.",
