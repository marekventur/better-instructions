Genes have been studied to uncover the hidden causes of many diseases and disabilities, paving the way for treatments tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup. Genetic testing can be used to screen for inherited conditions and provide information about inherited health risks. Genetically modified organisms are being used to develop new treatments for various diseases, such as gene therapy and artificial proteins. Genetic research is also being used to generate more efficient and personalized diagnoses and treatments for patients.",
