  "output": "A hypothetical situation in which AI technology could be used to improve the safety of workplaces is in factory settings. AI-enabled robots could be used to inspect the factory environment and detect potential hazards, such as broken equipment or frayed wires. The robots could also monitor workplace conditions, such as temperature and air quality, and alert workers if anything is out of the ordinary or if an unsafe environment is present.",
