  "input": "",
  "output": "Weather forecasting models are built by collecting vast amounts of data from weather stations all over the world, including temperature, pressure, wind, and other atmospheric readings. This data is then fed into computer models that simulate the behavior of the atmosphere. These models are constantly updated and refined with new data to create more accurate predictions about the weather. Ultimately, these models are used to generate forecasts which can be used to inform decision making.",
