  "input": "",
  "output": "An alternative method to solving a Rubik's cube is the layer by layer method, which involves solving one layer at a time. First, the white cross is solved by placing each edge piece into its proper place. The second layer is solved by inserting corner pieces and edge pieces in the correct positions. The final layer is solved by orienting edge pieces and the corners. The cube is then solved.",
