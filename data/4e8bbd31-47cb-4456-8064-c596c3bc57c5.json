As she walked in the park, she heard a rustling in the bushes and out came a beautiful white rabbit. She was stunned and delighted and followed it around the park until it wandered into a hidden part of the wood. Here, she found a grand castle, filled with strange and fascinating creatures. She knew that her life would never be the same again.",
