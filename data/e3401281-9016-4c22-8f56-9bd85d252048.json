  "instruction": "What is bubble sort?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list being sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. It is generally considered to be one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand, but it is still inefficient as its running time is O(n2). Bubble sort also has limited uses in practical applications as it is significantly less efficient than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.",
