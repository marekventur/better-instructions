  "instruction": "Come up with a creative solution to address this problem",
  "input": "Problem: Too many people crowding our local park.",
  "output": "One possible solution is to organize group activities that are open to the public. To encourage more people to participate in these activities, local businesses can offer discounts on services and products in exchange for attending. This will help draw people away from the park and provide some much-needed relief. Additionally, hosting activities in other areas of the city will further help spread out the crowds.",
