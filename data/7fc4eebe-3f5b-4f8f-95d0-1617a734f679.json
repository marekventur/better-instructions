  "output": "In the dusk of my despair,\nI long to find a way out of this misery.\nSo I search and search but can't make heads or tails,\nOf this labyrinth filled with an endless anguish and fear. \n\nMy yearning for a better world is mixed with so much dread,\nThat I can hardly keep a handle on my despair.\nMy hope is like a flickering flame, struggling to stay alive,\nBut it's not enough to bring back joy into the air. \n\nI sit in quiet reflection, tears streaming down my face,\nAs I ponder the weight of this sorrowful life.\nBut in this darkness, I hope that sadness begins to fade,\nAnd that the light of happiness can bring me back to life.",
