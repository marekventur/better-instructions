  "instruction": "Generate a hypothetical example of how people might use VR technology in 20 years.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "In 20 years, people may use virtual reality technology to explore and experience things they would otherwise not have access to. For example, a student may use a VR headset to take a field trip to a historical site, or a doctor may use a VR headset to practice a medical procedure before performing it in real life. VR technology may also be used to create immersive learning experiences, allowing people to learn by doing. Additionally, people may use VR technology to socialize with friends and family from all around the world, creating realistic and life-like virtual environments to communicate in.",
