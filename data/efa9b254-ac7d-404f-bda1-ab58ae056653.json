  "input": "No input",
  "output": "Deep learning can be used to analyze medical images and detect patterns in them, which can then be used to make diagnoses. For example, deep learning algorithms can be used to detect signs of cancer or other diseases on MRI scans. Deep learning can also be used to analyze patient data such as medical history and lab results and prescribe treatments accordingly.",
