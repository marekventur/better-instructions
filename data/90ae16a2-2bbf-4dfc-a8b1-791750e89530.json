The knight is well-equipped with armor, weapons, and courage to face any danger, while the wizard is armed with powerful spells and enchantment.\n\nThe players must work together cleverly to make it across the canyon without encountering any of the dangers waiting for them. They must race against each other and the clock as they confront obstacles, creatures, and puzzles.
