  "input": "",
  "output": "Global warming has had a significant impact on the environment. The Earth\u2019s average temperature has risen substantially, resulting in increased sea levels, extreme weather events, and greater threats to biodiversity. Additionally, climate change has caused acidification of the oceans, changes in soil structure, and a decrease in crop yields. These effects are likely to worsen in the future as temperatures continue to increase due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the effects of global warming can lead to other problems such as population displacement and decreased access to food, water, and other essential resources, causing poverty and ultimately, conflict. Global warming is a pressing issue and requires international cooperation and coordinated efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, and protect resources.",
