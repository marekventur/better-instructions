  "input": "",
  "output": "Schools can create more inclusive environments by creating a positive atmosphere in which every student feels safe, respected, and appreciated. This could involve implementing anti-bullying policies, offering high-quality diversity and inclusion training to staff and students, designing curricula that acknowledge and celebrate cultural and historical contributions of different groups, and creating extracurricular activities and clubs that represent different interests. Additionally, schools should promote open dialogue and encourage students and staff to be conscious of their biases.",
