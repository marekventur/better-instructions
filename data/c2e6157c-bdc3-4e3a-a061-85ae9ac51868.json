  "input": "The sky was so dark, and the stars so bright\nI almost fell as I looked up to the sky\nA storm is brewing, I can feel its might\nWhat wild secrets lurk up in the sky",
  "output": "The sky was so dark, with stars dipping low\nI couldn't help but tilt my head up high\nA storm was coming, the thunder winds did blow\nA secret kept aloft among the sky \n\nThe birds flew south, from their nests away\nI could feel the night breathe in my mind\nA darker fortune did I try to portray\nLest I be left with nothing to find\n\nAll at once I could see it in the air\nThe mystery burning within my sight\nLo and behold, my troubles all did end\nFor all my woes had found the light",
