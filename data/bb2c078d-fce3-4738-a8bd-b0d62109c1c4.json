  "output": "Setting up a website involves a number of steps. First, you need to pick a domain name and purchase hosting. Once the domain is registered and the hosting is purchased, you will need to connect the domain to the hosting so that the website can be accessed. Additionally, you will need to create and upload any content you want to appear on the website. Lastly, an SSL certificate should be obtained to protect visitors' data and ensure secure browsing.
