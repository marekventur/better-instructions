  "output": "The algorithm should check for prime numbers as follows:\n\nStep 1: Create a loop that iterates over all numbers between 2 and the given number.- \nStep 2: For each number, check if the given number is evenly divisible by it.\nStep 3: If the given number is evenly divisible by any number, then it is not a prime number.\nStep 4: If the given number is not divisible by any number, then it is a prime number.",
