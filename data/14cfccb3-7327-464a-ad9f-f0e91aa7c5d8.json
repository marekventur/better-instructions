  "input": "",
  "output": "Systematic risk is the risk of loss due to factors that cannot be easily diversified away and are shared across the entire market, such as macroeconomic trends. Unsystematic risk, on the other hand, is the risk of loss due to factors specific to an individual stock or other security, such as industry-specific risks or company-specific risks. Systematic risk applies to the entire market, while unsystematic risk applies only to a specific stock or security.",
