  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the main advantages of deep learning in NLP is its ability to model complex language structures and semantic relationships. Deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can capture temporal, hierarchical and contextual characteristics of language that are otherwise difficult to capture with traditional methods. This enables more accurate prediction of language-related applications, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis and question answering.",
