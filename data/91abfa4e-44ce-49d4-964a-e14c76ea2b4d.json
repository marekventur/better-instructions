  "output": "Verse 1:\nMy heart was free and open, ready to love\nBut the pain of what happened is enough\nSo I'm feeling so broken, ripped up in two\nThe world's an empty place, I wish that it wasn't true\n\nChorus:\nAnd I can't stand to think of what I've lost\nMy broken heart is something that I can't put a cost\nBut I'm hoping and wishing, and believing I'll heal\nAnd I'll come out of this better, I know that it's real\n\nVerse 2:\nI know I must heal, I'll take it one step at a time\nFor now I'm feeling sorrow for what once was mine\nStill I've grown stronger, it's just another part of me\nThough my heart will never be the same, it will eventually set me free\n\nChorus:\nAnd I can't stand to think of what I've lost\nMy broken heart is something that I can't put a cost\nBut I'm hoping and wishing, and believing I'll heal\nAnd I'll come out of this better, I know that it's real\n\nBridge:\nAnd though my heart is broken, I still have my soul\nThe lessons I've learned, they'll shape the person I'll be\nAnd I'll get through this pain, it's not the end of my life\nSo I'll keep searching until I find the light\n\nChorus:\nAnd I can't stand to think of what I've lost\nMy broken heart is something that I can't put a cost\nBut I'm hoping and wishing, and believing I'll heal\nAnd I'll come out of this better, I know that it's real",
