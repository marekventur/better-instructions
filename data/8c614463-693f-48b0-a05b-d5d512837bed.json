  "instruction": "Design an algorithm to check if a given string contains duplicate characters.",
  "input": "String = \"getbetterdataliteracy\"",
  "output": "The algorithm should loop through the string, keeping track of each character it encounters. If a character is encountered that has already been seen in the string, then return True, indicating that the string contains duplicate characters. Otherwise, if all characters have been seen only once, return False, indicating that there are no duplicate characters in the string.",
