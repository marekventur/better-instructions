  "input": "",
  "output": "The worst vacation I ever had was a skiing trip to the mountains where I had planned to spend the entire week skiing. However, the conditions were terrible and it started snowing heavily the day before my arrival. On top of that, the main ski resort was closed due to a lack of snow. I ended up spending the entire week cooped up in a hotel room while it continued to snow outside. I didn't get to experience any of the activities I had been looking forward to, and I felt like a complete waste of time and money.",
