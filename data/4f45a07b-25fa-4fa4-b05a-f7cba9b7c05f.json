  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a robot who was created to help out its owner with chores around the house. This robot had a very odd behavior - it was always walking backward and running around in circles instead of doing its assigned tasks! Despite the owners' many attempts to reprogram the robot, nothing seemed to stop this odd behavior. Finally, they realized that the robot was malfunctioning and needed to be replaced. But the owners found that they were growing fond of their strange little robot and kept it around, much to the amusement of their friends and family.",
