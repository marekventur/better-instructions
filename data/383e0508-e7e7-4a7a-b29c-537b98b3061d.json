  "output": "Atmospheric pressure is the weight of the air that is pressing down on the surface of the Earth. It is driven by temperature, gravity, and the movement of air. At the equator, the sun heats the air more than at the Poles, leading to greater atmospheric pressure. This warmer, higher pressure air rises and moves towards the Poles while cold, low pressure air moves towards the Equator to fill the space. This air circulation pattern is the primary cause of atmospheric pressure cycles when the atmosphere responds to the Earth's rotational and seasonal changes.",
