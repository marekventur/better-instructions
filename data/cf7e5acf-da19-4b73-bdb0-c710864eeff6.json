  "output": "To create a pie chart, first gather the data that you would like to represent. Then arrange that data into categories or fractions of a whole. Next, assign each fraction an angle size and draw a circle. Divide up the circle into sections, or wedges, each corresponding to the fractions of the data. Lastly, add labels and colors to the chart to make it easier to interpret.",
