  "input": "",
  "output": "The three most important considerations when hiring a new employee are the candidate's qualifications and experience, their attitude and aptitude, and the fit of their values with those of the organization. Qualifications and experience are important to make sure the candidate has the necessary skills to fulfil the position, and that they have a good track record of performance. Attitude and aptitude are important to assess the candidate's wider skills and attitudes, as well as their general intellectual ability and problem-solving skills. Lastly, an organization should look for a candidate who shares their values and beliefs in order to ensure a harmonious workplace environment.",
