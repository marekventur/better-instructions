  "input": "The article discusses the impact of deforestation on global wildlife populations.",
  "output": "Deforestation has had a significant impact on global wildlife populations. Forests are home to a variety of different species both on land and in the air, and they are essential habitat for many species. When these forests are destroyed, their species are at risk of extinction, leading to biodiversity loss and disruption to the delicate balance of nature. We must take steps to protect existing forests and introduce new regulations in order to prevent further deforestation. We must all work together to ensure that our children, and the future generations, will be able to enjoy the multitude of wildlife that makes up this earth.",
