  "input": "",
  "output": "Two people can apologize for their past behavior by having a heart-to-heart conversation. The first person should express any hurt or regret they feel over past mistakes or miscommunications. The second person can then validate the other person's feelings, and then offer an apology of their own. Then, they both can discuss ways to forgive each other and ways to have a better relationship going forward. If possible, they can come up with a plan to take concrete steps towards improving their relationship and rebuilding trust.",
