  "output": "For teens between the ages of 15 and 18 I recommend the 2017 comic book-influenced superhero movie, Wonder Woman. It follows the story of Diana Prince, an Amazon princess trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Along the way, she discovers her destiny, the power of love, and the power to fight the forces of evil and injustice. This movie is a great movie for teens, because of the themes of heroism, courage, and justice. It's also a great way to discuss empowerment, work-life balance, and empowerment of women. It's also a way to introduce teens to classic themes of love and courage, while being entertaining and inspiring.",
