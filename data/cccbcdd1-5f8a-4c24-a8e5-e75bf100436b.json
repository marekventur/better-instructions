  "input": "",
  "output": "One event that changed my perspective on life was when my grandmother passed away. I had been very close to my grandmother and she was like a second mother to me. When she died, I realized how fleeting life could be and how quickly things can change. I began to appreciate the little things in life more, and I also started paying more attention to what truly mattered to me. It was a difficult period in my life, but it opened my eyes to the importance of cherishing all moments and recognizing the value in all relationships.",
