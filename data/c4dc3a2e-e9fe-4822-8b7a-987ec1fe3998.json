  "input": "",
  "output": "A classic tradeoff between investing in security and cost reduction is that higher security often comes at a greater cost. The more sophisticated the security system, the more likely it is to be expensive. Similarly, increasing security measures such as offering web application firewalls and implementing strong authentication procedures costs money. To reduce cost, organizations may reduce their investment in security \u2013 which comes with its own risks. It's important to balance costs and security so that the organization can meet its security standards without sacrificing its overall budget.",
