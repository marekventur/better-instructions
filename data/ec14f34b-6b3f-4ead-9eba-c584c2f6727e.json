  "input": "",
  "output": "Heraclitus was trying to illustrate how change is constant and unavoidable. He meant that the same river will never be the same from one moment to the next, because it is always changing. The water, the environment, and the banks all change, so you are never stepping in the exact same river with each step. In this way, life is always in flux and one must remain open to change and growth.",
