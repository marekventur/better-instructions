The narrator believes the old man to be a vulture, and decides to kill him to rid the fear and paranoia that the old man's eye brings him. The narrator thinks he has committed the perfect crime and hides the body under the floorboards, but is consumed with guilt and is driven to confess when the beating of the old man's lifeless heart overtakes his own.",
