  "input": "",
  "output": "A relational database is a type of database that models data as tables of related information with rows and columns. It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manipulate data and establish relationships between tables. A non-relational database, or NoSQL database, is a type of database that models data as documents, instead of tables, and stores it in a non-tabular format. It is designed to be more flexible and scalable than a relational database.",
