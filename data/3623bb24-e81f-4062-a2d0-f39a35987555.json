Not only did she discover two elements - radium and polonium - she also helped to create life-saving machines for X-ray treatment of cancer patients. Marie also wrote powerful books, such as \u2018Radium and Its Use\u2019 and \u2018Radioactivity\u2019, which changed the way we think about physics. Her advocacy for women being accepted in the scientific field helped create important strides for growth and advancement in the modern era. Marie Curie was a remarkable woman who truly revolutionised the world.",
