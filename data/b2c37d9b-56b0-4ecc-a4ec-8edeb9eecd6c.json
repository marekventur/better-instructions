  "input": "",
  "output": "Plate tectonics is the scientific theory which states that the Earth\u2019s crust and outer mantle are composed of several large, thin plates which move in relation to each other over the underlying mantle. Each plate is composed of both oceanic and continental crust. Plate movement is driven by convection cells in the mantle, which push them slowly together, apart or over one another. This results in the formation of mountains, volcanoes, and oceans.",
