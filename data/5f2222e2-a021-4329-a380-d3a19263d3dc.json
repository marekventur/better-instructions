  "input": "",
  "output": "The Great Wall of China is one of the world's most impressive man-made wonders and is estimated to have been first built around 220 BCE by Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. The Great Wall of China was built primarily to keep out northern invaders, such as the Mongols who, at their largest extent, extended from the Pacific Ocean to the Danube River. Over the centuries, additional walls were added and connected, resulting in the extensive wall system we see today. It currently stretches over 5,500 miles and is a lasting testament to the ingenuity of the Chinese people.",
