The children played on the slide and laughed as they tried to catch the balloons being flung up in the air. As the cake was brought out, there was an excited cheer from the kids. After the singing and the blowing out of the candles, the children were presented with their presents and enjoyed watching the clown perform his tricks. The party was a great success, and all the children had smiles on their faces.",
