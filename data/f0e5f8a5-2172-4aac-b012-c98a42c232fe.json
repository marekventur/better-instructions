She often looked up at the stars in the night sky and imagined herself soaring through the galaxies, discovering amazing new planets. No matter how many times her friends and family dismiss her dreams, she continues to dream of the impossible and makes a vow to overcome every obstacle to get there. She spends her days studying hard and taking every opportunity she finds to increase her knowledge of anything space-related. Eventually, her hard work pays off and she is given the chance to join a space mission. Kate is filled with joy and anticipation as she looks forward to a life of exploration among the stars.",
