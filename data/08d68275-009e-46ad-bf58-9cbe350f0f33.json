  "output": "As a financial planner, I recommend saving for retirement by taking advantage of employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k)s or IRAs, which offer tax-deferred growth and potentially matching funds from employers; and putting money into high-yield savings accounts or CDs, which provide fixed returns. I also suggest setting up automatic transfers into retirement accounts and periodically increasing the amount you put in.",
