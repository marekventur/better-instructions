  "input": "",
  "output": "Rising sea levels caused by climate change can have devastating impacts on coastal communities. As sea levels rise, coastal floodplains experience more frequent and more severe storms, and are increasingly vulnerable to erosion and sea water contamination. Rising sea levels also threaten to displace millions of people who live in coastal areas if they are not able to adapt to the changing environment.",
