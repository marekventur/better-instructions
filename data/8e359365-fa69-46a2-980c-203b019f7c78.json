  "output": "John was walking through the forest when he heard a noise. He stopped and looked around, but he couldn't see anything. Suddenly he heard a twig snap and felt a chill run down his spine. He cautiously continued down the path, until he spotted a shadowy figure in the distance. Suddenly, a wolf emerged from the shadows and let out an eerie howl. John gasped in shock and ran as fast as he could out of the forest. After a few minutes, he reached safety, but his heart was still pounding from the encounter.",
