  "output": "The most common type of birds present in the Sahara desert are sandgrouse. Other species of birds commonly found in the Sahara include warblers, wheatears, larks, bustards, coursers, hoopoes and floricans. These birds are adapted to life in a desert environment, with the ability to tolerate extremely hot temperatures and limited sources of food and water. Some of these birds migrate to wetter climates near the Nile during the winter months, but many other species will remain in the Sahara for the majority of the year.",
