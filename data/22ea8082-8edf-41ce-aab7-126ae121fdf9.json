  "output": "Deep Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that is based on the concept of creating and training artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to enable computers to perform complex tasks that are typically done by humans, such as pattern recognition, natural language processing, and object recognition. Deep Learning algorithms use multiple layers of artificial neurons to process data and enable computers to learn, improve, and make decisions with minimal human input.",
