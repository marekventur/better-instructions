  "output": "It was the last time she would ever set foot in the old house. She felt a wave of nostalgia wash over her as she stepped inside, memories of a childhood lived in this house flooding her mind. It had been her home for many years and she had grown up with her siblings here. When her parents had to leave, she'd been the only one left, determined to stay and hold onto the only place she'd ever felt like she belonged. But there were too many painful memories for her to stay and she knew she had to move on. With a heavy heart, she quietly gathered her things and walked out for the final time.",
