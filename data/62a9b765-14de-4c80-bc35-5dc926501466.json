  "instruction": "How does sharding work?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Sharding is a database partitioning technique that divides a database into separate, smaller parts called shards. This can be used to improve the performance of a database by allowing the data to be distributed across multiple nodes. Each shard holds a subset of the data, and by spreading out the load, requests can be handled faster and more efficiently than in a centralized system.",
