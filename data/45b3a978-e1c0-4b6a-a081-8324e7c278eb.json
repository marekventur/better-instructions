  "input": "",
  "output": "Volcanoes and earthquakes both involve the movement of the earth's tectonic plates. Volcanic eruptions often occur during seismic activity. Earthquakes are caused by the sudden shifting of the plates, resulting in the release of energy in the form of seismic waves. Volcanoes are formed when molten rock and ash are released from beneath the earth's surface, usually as the result of plate tectonics. This can cause significant damage and destruction in the area. Earthquakes can cause significant damage and destruction in the area, while volcanic eruptions can also cause long-term environmental damage. Both can have serious impacts on human lives and infrastructure.",
