  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the most difficult concepts in mathematics is calculus. Calculus is the branch of mathematics that studies the rate of change of functions and deals with derivatives, integrals and limits. It is a challenging concept to learn due to its complexity and the need to be able to think spatially and analytically. It requires a strong mathematical background, and many applications of calculus are only learned through practice and hard work. \n// end of output //",
