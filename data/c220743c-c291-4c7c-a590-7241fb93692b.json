  "input": "",
  "output": "Paul Cezanne's 'Basket of Apples' painting is a still life composed of a simple table top setting with a large wicker basket of apples balanced on top. Color-wise, the painting has a muted palette of blues, reds, and yellows, which all fade together to create a dreamy atmosphere. The brush strokes are visible and add to the overall ethereal quality of the painting.",
