  "instruction": "Generate a solution for the following problem that involves binary search",
  "input": "Given an array of size n, search for an element x",
  "output": "A binary search can be used to solve this problem. First, the array must be sorted in ascending order. Then, set a low and high index. Compare the element at the mid-index with the target element. If the target element is lower than the mid-index, move the high index to the mid-index minus one. If it is higher, move the low index to the mid-index plus one. Repeat until the element is found or the low index is greater than the high index.",
