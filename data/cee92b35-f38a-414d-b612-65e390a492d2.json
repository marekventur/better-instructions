  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a family of animals deep in the heart of a secluded forest. They lived in a beautiful old house that no one else knew about. \n\nOne day, the weather suddenly changed drastically. The sky was filled with clouds and the rain came down in a torrential downpour. The animals sought refuge in their house, but soon realized that the rain was too much and the house was beginning to flood. \n\nSo they worked together and gathered twigs and logs to build a makeshift raft. Then they floated away, leaving their old house behind. It was a long journey, but eventually they reached the other side of the forest, where the weather was beautiful and calm. \n\nThe animals stayed there and built a new house, surrounded by luscious green trees and a clear blue sky. And they lived happily ever after.",
