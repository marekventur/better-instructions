  "input": "",
  "output": "Plants are essential for life because they produce oxygen, the gas we need to breathe, and they are important for the carbon cycle. They take in carbon dioxide from the air, convert it into food through photosynthesis, and release oxygen for us to breathe. They also provide food for animals and humans via fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Plants also provide materials for building and clothing, with paper and cotton being two of the most widely used materials. Additionally, plants are vital to reducing global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide to keep carbon in balance.",
