  "input": "",
  "output": "The consequences of using a mobile phone at school could range from mild to severe, depending on the rules of the school. Generally, it could lead to disciplinary actions such as temporary confiscation or permanent confiscation of the device. Additionally, using a phone during class could lead to a student missing out on important information that is being taught, resulting in lower grades. In some cases, it could also be seen as a distraction to other students and result in further disciplinary action.",
