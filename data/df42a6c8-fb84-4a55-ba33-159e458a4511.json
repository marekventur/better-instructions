  "input": "",
  "output": "The customer journey is the path a customer takes to complete a goal, such as making a purchase or enrolling in a service. It includes decisions and activities the customer takes before, during, and after their goal is reached. The customer experience, on the other hand, is the customer\u2019s overall perception of the company and the product/service they interacted with. It includes the customer\u2019s perception of the quality of customer service, overall customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty. The customer experience encompasses more than just the customer\u2019s interactions with the company, it is their perception of the whole experience.",
