  "output": "The dust bowl in the 1930s was caused by a combination of natural factors and human activity. During this period, the central Great Plains region experienced a prolonged drought, which contributed to the spread of dust storms. This drought was made worse by farmers plowing the land too deeply and over-irrigating their crops, which destabilized the soil and led to wind erosion. This combination of natural and human factors led to the dust bowl and its devastating effects.",
