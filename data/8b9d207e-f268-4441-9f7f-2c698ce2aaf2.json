  "input": "Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms, including their physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development and evolution. On the most fundamental level, all organisms consist of basic elements (mutually interdependent molecules of biological polymers) that are able to form complex components and then, in turn, durable and evolutionary stable structures. The study of the structure and function of cells is the main focus of molecular biology. The study of the properties of tissues, organs and organ systems is called physiology.",
  "output": "Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms. Elements of organisms interact together to form complex structures and repeat this process to form evolutionary stable structures. Molecular biology focuses on the structure and function of cells, while physiology studies the properties of tissues, organs and organ systems. Through biology, scientists can understand how organisms interact with and adapt to their environment, as well as how species evolve and change over time. By studying biology, we gain valuable insights into the mystery of life.",
