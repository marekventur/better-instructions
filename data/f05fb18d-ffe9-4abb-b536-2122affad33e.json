  "input": "",
  "output": "The two major challenges facing the agriculture industry in developing countries are food security and environmental sustainability. \n\nFood security refers to the ability of individuals and households to access food, which is often limited or non-existent in developing countries due to poverty and weak infrastructure. This lack of access to food is closely linked to the high malnutrition rates seen in many developing countries. \n\nEnvironmental sustainability is another challenge that is facing the agriculture industry in developing countries due to the increasingly hostile environment in which farmers must work. Climate change is a major contributor to this hostile environment, leading to shifting precipitation patterns, extreme weather events, and an increase in soil degradation. These issues can lead to lower yields, reduced crop variety, and a decreased lifespan for crops, all of which can further exacerbate the food insecurity issues present in many developing countries.",
