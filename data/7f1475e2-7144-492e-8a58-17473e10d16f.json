  "instruction": "Identify how the given substance influences the color of a flame.",
  "input": "Potassium chloride",
  "output": "The addition of potassium chloride to a flame will cause the flame to become a lilac color. This is because potassium chloride breaks down in the heat, releasing chlorine and potassium, which interact with the oxygen in the air and create the colored flame. Potassium chloride is commonly used to create colorful effects in fireworks.",
