  "instruction": "Describe the difference between polynomial equations and exponential equations",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Polynomial equations are equations that contain a variable with non-negative, whole-number exponents, such as x2 + 3x + 5. Exponential equations, on the other hand, contain a variable with a positive, non-integer exponent, such as ex or 2x. Polynomial equations often have multiple solutions, and the solutions can be solved using algebraic methods, such as factoring or using the quadratic formula. Exponential equations are usually solved using logarithms and exponentials. Exponential equations have one solution, and this solution is not always easily obtained by algebraic methods.",
