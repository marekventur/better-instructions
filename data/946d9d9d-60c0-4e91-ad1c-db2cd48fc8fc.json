  "output": "Removing a stain from a fabric requires several steps. Firstly, identify the type of stain and select a cleaning product suitable for the fabric. Then, apply the cleaning solution directly to the stain and allow it to sit for several minutes. Once the stain has soaked up the cleaning product, gently scrub the stain with a soft brush or cloth in a circular motion. Finally, rinse the area with cool water and repeat the process as necessary until the stain has been completely removed.",
