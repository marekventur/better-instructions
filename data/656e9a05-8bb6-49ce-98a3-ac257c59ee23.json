  "output": "GPT can be used for solving complex tasks such as natural language understanding by leveraging its context-dependent understanding capabilities. GPT-based applications can learn to interpret language in different variants such as domain-specific terminology or often used idioms. In addition, GPT language models can understand the relationships between words and generate output which follows grammatical and semantic rules.",
