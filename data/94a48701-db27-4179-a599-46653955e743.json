  "input": "",
  "output": "Evolutionary algorithms are a set of optimization algorithms used to solve complex problems. These algorithms imitate the process of natural selection and can be used to optimize a wide range of real-world problems. They are inspired by the process of natural selection and work by starting with a population of possible solutions, or \"candidates,\" and then creating a new generation of solutions by changing and combining existing solutions. The new solutions are then evaluated and the best ones are selected to form the next generation of solutions. This process is continued until an optimal solution is found.  Evolutionary algorithms are often used for complex optimization problems where the problem cannot be easily solved using traditional algorithms.",
