  "input": "",
  "output": "Having a diverse team is important because it allows for a more well-rounded perspective on projects. Diversity allows for ideas and solutions to be looked at from a variety of angles, filling in the gaps that a homogenous team may not be able to see. A diverse team also provides a better understanding of different target audiences. Working with a range of worldviews, backgrounds and experiences allows for creativity and innovation in problem-solving that may not have been possible before. Finally, having a diverse team helps to create a more open and welcoming environment, where everyone's thoughts and opinions are respected.",
