  "output": "The primary components of a fax machine are the handset, keypad, paper tray, transmission/receiving unit, and printer/scanner. The handset is typically used to listen to the transmissions sent over the line and can also be used to send incoming calls to the fax machine. The keypad is used for entering commands and for dialing phone numbers. The paper tray holds the paper that will be printed by the fax machine. The transmission/receiving unit sends the information to the other fax machine, or sends incoming faxes to the printer or scanner. The printer/scanner prints out incoming faxes and can scan documents for outgoing transmission.",
