  "input": "",
  "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use the energy of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. In five steps: (1) Light energy is absorbed by pigment molecules in the chloroplasts; (2) Absorbed energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen atoms, releasing oxygen as a byproduct; (3) The hydrogen atoms are then combined with carbon dioxide molecules to form carbohydrates; (4) Energy is released in the form of ATP; (5) The carbohydrates are then used as fuel for the plant.",
