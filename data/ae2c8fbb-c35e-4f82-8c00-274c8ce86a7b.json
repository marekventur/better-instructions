  "instruction": "Describe how a virus enters a host cell.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Viruses typically use a process called endocytosis to enter a host cell, where the virus attaches itself to the cell's membrane and is then taken in. Inside the cell, the virus will release its genetic material, which then hijacks the cell's genetic machinery and takes control of the cell to produce viral proteins and replicate itself. The new viruses are then released from the cell, allowing the cycle to start again.",
