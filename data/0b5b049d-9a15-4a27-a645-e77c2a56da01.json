  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the most effective ways to reduce plastic waste in society is to increase public awareness and education about the negative impacts of single-use plastics. This can be done through campaigns and initiatives that emphasize sustainable, eco-friendly alternatives, such as reusable bags, bottles, and utensils. Additionally, governments should support policies and laws that discourage the use of single-use plastics, such as taxation or plastic bag bans in stores. Finally, encouraging businesses to switch to more sustainable practices can also help reduce their plastic waste.",
