  "instruction": "Create a policy that would help solve this problem.",
  "input": "Increasing air pollution in cities",
  "output": "The government should implement a policy of strict air quality control to reduce air pollution in cities. This policy should include a set of regulations that address key sources of pollution, such as factories and motor vehicles. These regulations should incentivize the adoption of cleaner technologies and production practices, such as the use of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles, and should impose restrictions on the amount of harmful pollutants that can be released into the atmosphere. Furthermore, to ensure compliance with the policy, the government should enforce the regulations by implementing strong punishments and sanctions on violators.",
