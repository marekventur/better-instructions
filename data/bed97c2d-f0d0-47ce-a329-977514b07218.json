  "input": "",
  "output": "The phrase \"All's well that ends well\" is used to convey the sentiment that the outcome of a situation is far more important than the manner in which it was achieved. It implies that, as long as the final result is satisfactory, whatever struggles or difficulties are encountered along the way can be forgiven. It's a reminder to stay positive and not worry too much about the small details as long as the end result is ultimately successful.",
