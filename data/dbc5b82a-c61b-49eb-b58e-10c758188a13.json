  "output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to dramatically improve the lives of people around the world. AI can assist with everyday tasks, from scheduling appointments to providing medical advice, and it can automate jobs that are repetitive, time consuming, and dangerous. AI can aid in decision making, helping to ensure that the best possible choices are made quickly and accurately. AI can help to inform policy decisions and development projects so that resources can be used more effectively, ensuring that no one in need is left behind. In addition to its practical applications, AI research serves to deepen our understanding of the world and ourselves, helping to solve complex problems and push the boundaries of what is possible. By emphasizing the importance of human-centered AI development, we can ensure that the benefits of artificial intelligence are shared with all of humanity.",
