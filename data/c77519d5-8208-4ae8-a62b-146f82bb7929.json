  "instruction": "Describe the process of how a loan application is verified.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "When a person takes out a loan, the lender must verify the borrower's identity and creditworthiness. This process involves the lender verifying the applicant's income, reviewing the repayment terms and interest rate, making sure the applicant does not have any lien or bankruptcy proceedings against them, and assessing the risk of the loan. The lender may also perform a background check to make sure that the borrower has a good employment and financial history. Once the loan application is approved, it will be sent to the lender, who will then release the loan if they find it appropriate.",
