  "input": "",
  "output": "Poverty is one of the primary causes of homelessness, as the costs associated with finding and maintaining a home can often be insurmountable for those living in poverty. Homelessness can be caused by a lack of access to safe and affordable housing, as well as an inability to provide for basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare. Additionally, high rent/mortgage costs, high unemployment rates, and low wages also contribute to homelessness. Without access to basic resources and enough income, people can become homeless and find themselves caught in a cycle of poverty and homelessness.",
