  "input": "",
  "output": "Soccer and American Football are both team sports that involve two teams competing against each other to score points. However, they differ in many ways. Soccer is played by kicking the ball with the feet while American Football uses a combination of kicking and throwing the ball. Soccer is played on a much larger field compared to the smaller field of American Football, and the duration of a game is also longer in Soccer. The scoring systems of the two sports also differ; in Soccer, points are awarded for scoring goals while American Football awards both points for goals and for making successful offensive plays.",
