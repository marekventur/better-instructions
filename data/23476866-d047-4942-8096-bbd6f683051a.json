Wear suitable clothing, including flame-resistant gloves and long clothing that completely covers the arms and legs. Ensure that the area is well-ventilated and clear of any combustible materials. Check to make sure that the blowtorch is in good working condition and has all the necessary safety features, such as a pressure regulator, gas shutoff valve, and safety catch.
