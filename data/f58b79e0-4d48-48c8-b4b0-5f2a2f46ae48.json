  "input": "",
  "output": "The \"for\" loop in JavaScript is used to execute a statement or code block multiple times. It is usually used when the exact number of iterations is known. The \"for\" loop has three parameters: an initial value, a condition to test for, and an increment expression. The loop itself consists of a loop header with the for keyword and three expressions, first the initialization statement, then the condition expression, and lastly an update expression.",
