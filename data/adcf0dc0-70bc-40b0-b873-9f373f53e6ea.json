  "input": "",
  "output": "A substitution cipher is a cryptographic code which replaces each letter in the plaintext with another letter. For example, a substitution cipher might replace each letter with the letter three positions after it in the alphabet. So, the letter \"A\" would be replaced with the letter \"D\", the letter \"B\" would be replaced with the letter \"E\", and so on.",
