  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural selection favors the survival of certain genes because they give organisms a better chance of surviving in their environment. For example, some genes can help organisms better find food or predators or avoid dangerous ones. Over time, these genes become more common because they give organisms a better chance of surviving and passing on their genes to the next generation.",
