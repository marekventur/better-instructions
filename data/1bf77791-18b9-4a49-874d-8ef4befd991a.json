  "output": "The economy of China is one of the largest in the world and is made up of a mix of state-owned, private and foreign-invested companies. One of the world\u2019s leading exporters of manufactured goods, it also has a large services sector and is one of the most important global sources of capital investment. The Chinese economy has grown rapidly in recent decades as a result of its focus on investment, infrastructure and external financial support. This has been helped by low-interest rates and access to markets. Despite these large investments, the country faces issues such as a lack of transparency in the financial system, high levels of government debt and environmental problems.",
