  "instruction": "What are two methods for training a neural network?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Two efficient methods for training a neural network are backpropagation and optimization. Backpropagation involves adjusting the weights and biases within the network so that it minimizes the error between the predicted and actual output, while optimization overcomes the non-convexity of the training by using advanced optimization algorithms. Both methods can be used in tandem to maximize the accuracy of the neural network.",
