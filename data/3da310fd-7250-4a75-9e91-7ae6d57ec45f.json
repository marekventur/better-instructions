The waves lapped gently against the shore, their gentle rhythm creating a soothing ambiance. Small seagulls flew across the sky, their cries echoing in the air as they searched for food. The sand shifted with every step, reflecting the fading light and creating a path of shimmering gold. In the far distance, a lighthouse shone its bright light, a beacon of safety and hope.",
