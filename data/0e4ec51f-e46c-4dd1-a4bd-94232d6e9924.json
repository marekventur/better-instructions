Lumi had the power to create, shape and manipulate the enchanted trees and plants of the forest. With this power, she could transform the forest into a place of wondrous beauty, filled with lights and colors beyond belief. \n\nEvery day, Lumi would open the gate to her magical forest and visitors from all over would be in awe of the splendor it contained. Journeying through the forest, one could find the ancient tree of dreams, the rainbow bridge, the fountain of stars and the path of dancing leaves. Every creature, from the tiny faeries to the mighty dragons, could find solace and joy in the warm embrace of the magical forest. \n\nThough unknown to many, this beautiful place was Lumi's secret. For she knew that the powers of her magical forest were too powerful to be known by all.",
