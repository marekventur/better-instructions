  "input": "",
  "output": "Mutual funds are investment funds that pool money from a large number of investors to purchase a variety of different securities in a diversified portfolio. An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that are traded on a stock exchange. ETFs generally have lower costs and fewer restrictions than mutual funds, but they are also more volatile. Mutual funds are actively managed, whereas ETFs are passively managed and track the performance of an index or asset class.",
