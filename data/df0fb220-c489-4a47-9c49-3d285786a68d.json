  "output": "One recipe for a dessert that can be prepared in 10 minutes is chocolate pudding. It requires only 4 ingredients: 2 cups of milk, 1/4 cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder. To make the pudding, heat the milk and sugar in a pot until it reaches a low boil. Mix the cornstarch and cocoa powder with a small amount of the hot milk and stir it into the pot. Cook the mixture until it thickens and remove it from the heat. Pour the pudding into individual serving dishes and allow it to cool before serving.",
