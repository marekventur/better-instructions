  "output": "The capuchin monkey is a species of new world monkey that is native to Central and South America. Capuchins are generally small in size, with an adult ranging in size from 12 to 22 inches long and weighing 4 to 9 pounds. They have light fur that ranges in color from light brown to black. They have a prehensile tail which allows them to hang from trees and use their tail as an extra hand. Capuchins are also adept at using tools and have been seen using sticks to dig for food or to stir up ants.",
