But Sammy was always feeling rather adventurous, so one night he decided to go off on his own to explore. \n\nHe walked and walked through the woods until nightfall, and before he knew it, it was dark outside. But suddenly Sammy spotted something bright in the distance. When he got closer he realized that it was a beautiful firefly. Sammy was mesmerized by the firefly, and he carefully followed it until the it lead him home.\n\nBut when he arrived home, Sammy was surprised to find his family standing outside the den, waiting for him with open arms. Sammy had had such a magical adventure, he couldn't help but tell them all about it. Everyone smiled and nodded along as Sammy recounted his tale. \n\nAnd from then on, Sammy knew he would always have an adventure waiting for him, right outside his door. The End.",
