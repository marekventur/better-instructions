  "output": "Making a triangle out of three sticks is quite simple. First, take three sticks of equal length and lay them down in the shape of a triangle. For a basic triangle, the three sticks should be arranged so that each end of each stick meets the end of the other two sticks. Afterwards, use duct tape or a strong adhesive to connect the ends of the sticks together to form a sturdy triangle. After that, the triangle should be ready for use.",
