  "output": "One time when my judgment was clouded by emotions was when I had a disagreement with a close friend. We were both feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, and I could feel myself getting angry and irrational. I let my emotions take over, and the argument quickly escalated. In hindsight, if I had taken a few moments to calm down and think clearly, I probably could have handled it better.",
