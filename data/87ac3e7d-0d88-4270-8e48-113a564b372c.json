  "output": "AI and ML are two different terms related to the field of computing. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broader concept where machines are programmed to replicate human-like intelligence and behaviour. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where machines learn from data to detect patterns and insights without explicit programming. AI takes a more general approach to problem-solving whereas ML enables machines to optimize their performance based on the data provided.",
