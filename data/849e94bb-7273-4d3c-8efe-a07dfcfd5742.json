  "input": "",
  "output": "A refrigerator and a freezer differ in their primary function, temperature, and design. A refrigerator is typically used to store food and beverages at temperatures between 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit, while a freezer is designed to keep food at temperatures between 0 to -18 degrees Fahrenheit. In terms of design, a refrigerator usually comes with shelves and compartments that can be adjusted to fit different sizes of food items, while a freezer typically comes with drawers that are designed for organizing food items. Additionally, a freezer's shelves are typically thinner than a refrigerator's shelves, resulting in a larger capacity that can be used to store large quantities of frozen food.",
