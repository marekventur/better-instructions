  "input": "The increasing cost of pharmaceutical drugs.",
  "output": "The most significant factor in the increasing cost of pharmaceutical drugs is the cost of research and development for new drugs. Pharmaceutical companies invest a lot of money in developing new drugs and therefore have to charge high prices in order to offset the cost. Additionally, the consolidation of the industry and decreased competition among the major drug companies has limited competitive pricing and created higher prices.",
