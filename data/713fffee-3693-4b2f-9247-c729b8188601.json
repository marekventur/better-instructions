  "input": "",
  "output": "GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a transformer-based language model. It has gained attention for its promise in helping automate different Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as relevant questions answering, document summarization, and text generation. Its benefits include the ability to easily pre-train the model using large-scale unlabeled text, its robustness in handling noise, and its flexibility in adapting to different text-related tasks such as language translation and question answering. Additionally, GPT can be used to generate large amounts of data quickly as well as to improve existing tasks such as sentiment analysis. By leveraging the power of transformers, GPT can enable faster and more accurate decisions for tasks that involve natural languages.",
