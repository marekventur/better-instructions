  "input": "",
  "output": "One algorithm that can be used to multiply two integers is the Russian Peasant Multiplication algorithm. This algorithm works by repeatedly halving the first number (dividing it by 2) and doubling the second number (multiplying it by 2). The process is repeated until the first number is equal to 1. Then, the products of each step are added together and the result is the product of the two integers.",
