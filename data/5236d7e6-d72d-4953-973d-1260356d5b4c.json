  "output": "Climate change is having a dramatic impact on extreme weather events across the globe. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events has risen significantly over the past few decades, with higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and changes in rainfall patterns contributing to a greater likelihood of extreme weather events. \n\nThese extreme events include increased hurricanes, floods and storms, heat waves, and other natural disasters. Hurricanes, for example, are becoming increasingly common and more intense due to higher sea surface temperatures, increased evaporation, and higher air temperatures. These impacts are felt in the form of more costly and destructive hurricanes, causing more damage and claiming more lives. \n\nFloods, too, pose an ever-increasing danger. Rising sea levels put coastal regions at risk for more destructive floods, and heavier and more frequent rainfalls add to the risk of flooding in already vulnerable areas. In 2018, for example, record-breaking rains in the Midwest resulted in widespread flooding that cost billions of dollars in damages and claimed many lives. \n\nBut the effects of climate change are not limited to floods and storms. Heat waves are becoming more frequent and more intense, resulting in droughts, crop failures, and massive economic losses due to infrastructure damage. Further, changes in weather patterns can disrupt migration patterns resulting in an increase in human-animal conflicts. \n\nIn addition to the direct fatalities and damage caused by these extreme events, climate change has also caused numerous other long-term impacts on the environment and economy, such as degrading air quality, resulting in respiratory illnesses, soil depletion, and economic instability. Given these issues, it is clear that reducing the global impact of climate change must be a priority.",
