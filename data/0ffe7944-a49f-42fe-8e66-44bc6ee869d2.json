  "input": "",
  "output": "The environmental impact of continuous flying is significant. Aircraft emissions, such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and water vapor, are primary causes of climate change. Aircraft emissions are responsible for up to 3.5% of global temperature increase and account for around 2% of total global carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, aircrafts fly at altitudes lower than other forms of transportation and affects local air quality. Aircrafts are also extremely loud, causing disruption to wildlife populations and a negative impact on human health.",
