  "output": "The Queen Alexandra's Birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae) is the largest known butterfly in the world, and can be found in the jungles of New Guinea. It has a wingspan of up to 11 inches (28 cm) and each wing is patterned with black, yellow, and green colors. Females are larger and brighter colored than the males. The flight of the Queen Alexandra's Birdwing is powerful and fast. It is also a good flier and can cover long distances quickly. This butterfly is considered endangered due to overcollection, deforestation and sometimes fires in the area where the butterfly lives. However, conservation and protection efforts are underway to try to save it.",
