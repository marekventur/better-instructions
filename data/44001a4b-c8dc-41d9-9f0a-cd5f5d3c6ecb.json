Integrity is another important quality of a leader, as it allows them to maintain a high level of credibility with those they lead. In addition, a leader must be decisive and able to act decisively when needed. An effective leader is also an excellent communicator and is able to effectively convey ideas, directions, and instructions to team members and other stakeholders. A leader must also be committed to the cause and willing to go the extra mile to ensure success. Furthermore, a leader must have the courage to make difficult decisions when necessary. Empathy is critical for a leader to be able to understand their team and make a connection with their members.
