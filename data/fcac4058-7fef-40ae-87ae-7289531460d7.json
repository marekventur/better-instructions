  "output": "The automobile industry has been a driving force of economic growth in the United States since the early 1900s. The first vehicle to be mass-produced was the Ford Model T in 1908, and it quickly revolutionized how people moved around the country. This marked the beginning of a boom in the automotive industry, and from there many of the major American car manufactures would emerge, including General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford. The industry went on to shape the culture and lifestyle of Americans for generations to come.",
