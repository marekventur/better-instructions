  "input": "",
  "output": "A reasonable expectation for returning a borrowed item would be to return the item in the same condition as it was borrowed in a timely manner. The amount of time that is considered reasonable would depend on the agreement between the lender and the borrower. If there is not an agreement in place, then it is recommended to assume that the item should be returned within a reasonable amount of time, typically no longer than two weeks.",
