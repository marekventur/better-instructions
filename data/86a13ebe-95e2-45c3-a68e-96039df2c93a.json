  "output": "It is difficult to predict the exact effects of COVID-19 on the world economy 3 to 5 years from now. However, we may see a greater emphasis on digital commerce, a continuing shift away from traditional brick-and-mortar retail, and a larger share of economic activity taking place in the online marketplaces. Additionally, the pandemic will likely continue to place an emphasis on health and safety, meaning new safety regulations and intense monitoring of industry performance may become common.",
