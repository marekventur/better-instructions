  "output": "The interface should be simple, intuitive, and easy to use. It should include a main dashboard with sections for daily tasks, upcoming deadlines, notes, and events. It should also have the ability to quickly and easily add new tasks and notes. Additionally, the interface should have options for setting reminders, sorting tasks, and setting a timer for tasks. Finally, the interface should provide a way to customize the productivity app to suit the unique needs of each user.",
