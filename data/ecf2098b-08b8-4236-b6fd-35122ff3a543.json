  "instruction": "Describe the differences between a cloud and a fog in 3-4 sentences.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Clouds and fog are both composed of tiny water droplets, suspended in the atmosphere. However, clouds form at higher altitudes than fog, and they are much larger and thicker. Clouds tend to move slowly and bring rain or snow, while fog is thicker and forms near the ground, typically lessening visibility. Clouds are also more diverse than fog in terms of composition and makeup, since clouds can be made up of a mix of liquid and solid particles. Fog, on the other hand, is composed of condensed droplets of water. Finally, clouds can be associated with a wide range of weather conditions, while fog usually indicates a humid climate.",
