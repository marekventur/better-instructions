  "input": "",
  "output": "Normalization is the process of scaling and shifting data so that it has a consistent form and can be compared and evaluated more easily. Normalization usually involves changing the data range so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. It is a necessary step in many types of data pre-processing, such as for machine learning models or data visualization.",
