  "input": "",
  "output": "Oceans are essential to life on Earth as they regulate the climate and weather, provide habitat for millions of species, and are a major source of oxygen production. They absorb about 30% of the carbon dioxide produced by human activities, helping to maintain global temperatures; they also provide a critical source of protein for billions of people around the world. Moreover, oceans are a major economic asset, generating billions of dollars in revenue from activities such as fishing and tourism.",
