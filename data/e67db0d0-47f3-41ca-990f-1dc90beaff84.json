  "input": "",
  "output": "The moon affects the ocean's tides through its gravitational pull. The gravitational pull between the moon and the Earth causes the water on the side of the Earth closest to the moon to be pulled away, forming the high tide. Meanwhile, the water on the side farthest from the moon is pulled towards the moon, forming the low tide.",
