  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to improve air quality in urban cities is to reduce emissions from vehicles. This can be done by introducing stricter emission standards, fostering public transportation and encouraging the use of electric vehicles. Furthermore, the implementation of green infrastructure such as green roofs and vertical gardens can help to improve air quality by absorption of pollutants and by increasing the amount of vegetation in the city. Additionally, more efficient heating and cooling systems can reduce the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere. Finally, regular maintenance of appliances and vehicles can reduce emissions.",
