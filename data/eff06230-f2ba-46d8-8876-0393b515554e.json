  "output": "One of the most interesting train journeys I ever took was from Havana to Santiago, Cuba. I was mesmerized by all the beautiful scenery outside, as well as the interactions I had with the other passengers on board the train. The locals were friendly and welcoming, and it was a great opportunity for me to learn more about the culture, customs, and language of the country. The most memorable part of this trip was when the train stopped at small stations in the middle of nowhere, and we could get off and get a taste of small-town life. All in all, it was an incredibly fulfilling and once-in-a-lifetime experience!",
