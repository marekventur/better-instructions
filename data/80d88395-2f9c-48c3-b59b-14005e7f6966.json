  "output": "Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879 to April 18, 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. He is best known for his mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles, and his work in physics has profoundly impacted the 20th and 21st centuries.",
