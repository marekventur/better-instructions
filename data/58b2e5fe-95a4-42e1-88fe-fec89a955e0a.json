  "output": "The phrase \u201ctime flies when you are having fun\" is a proverb that implies an hour or minutes seem to pass quickly when you are enjoying yourself. This phenomenon is caused by the feeling of being in the moment and the inability to sense the passing of time. When immersed in enjoyable activities such as playing a game, having a conversation with a friend, or watching a movie, people are so focused on the activity that the time appears to pass faster.",
