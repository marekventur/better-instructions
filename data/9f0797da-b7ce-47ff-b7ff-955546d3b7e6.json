  "input": "Nip it in the bud",
  "output": "The idiom 'nip it in the bud' means to take action to stop a problem or activity before it gets worse. It is derived from the horticultural practice of pruning a young plant or its flower buds to stop it growing any bigger. Taking this action at an early stage makes it easier to prevent further growth. This is why the phrase is used to mean taking action at the earliest opportunity in order to deal with a problem or prevent it from getting out of control.",
