  "input": "",
  "output": "GPT models are based on the idea of using a neural network to generate natural language output. They use large datasets of example text to learn patterns in the data, and then apply these patterns to generate new text. In the most basic form, the GPT model takes an input and outputs a sentence that is related to the input. However, GPT models can also be trained to generate longer text, such as stories and articles, by using a repeated input/output loop.",
