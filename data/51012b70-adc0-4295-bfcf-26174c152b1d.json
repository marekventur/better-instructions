  "instruction": "Determine the probability that a team will win the game given the equation P(x) = (x + 1) / (x + 3).",
  "input": "x = 2",
  "output": "The probability that a team will win the game given the equation P(x) = (x + 1) / (x + 3) is 3/5, or 0.6. This equation is an example of a linear function, which means that the probability will increase as the value of x increases. Therefore, the higher the value of x, the higher the probability of the team winning.",
