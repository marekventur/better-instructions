  "output": "Social capital is the level of connectivity, trust, and collaboration found within a society or group of people. It involves relationships between individuals, as well as networks of relationships between organizations and institutions. Generally, social capital refers to how easily individuals can access resources and opportunities through their existing relationships or contacts. It is often seen as a form of intangible wealth, as well as a measure of the collective wellbeing of a society. For example, strong social capital may lead to higher levels of trust within a community, facilitate smoother interactions between people and organizations, and help increase individual and collective prosperity.",
