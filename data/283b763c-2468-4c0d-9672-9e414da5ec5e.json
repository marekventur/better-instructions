  "input": "",
  "output": "The snow leopard is a large cat with some distinct features. They have thick fur that is a combination of white and light grey with black spots. They also have long tails, big paws, and powerful hind legs that help them to leap up to 9 meters in length and 3 meters in height. They are excellent climbers and use their furry tails as a counterbalance when walking on uneven terrain. Snow leopards are also shy and solitary animals, rarely venturing out of their natural habitat.",
