  "output": "I once made a mistake in misinterpreting a customer\u2019s request which led to a small project failure. I learnt from that mistake and took the time to understand the customer\u2019s needs better so I would be more prepared for the next project. I also took the initiative to actively communicate with the customer and explain my actions. This turned the failure into a learning opportunity and ultimately a success.",
