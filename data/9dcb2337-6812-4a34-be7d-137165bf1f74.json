  "instruction": "Explain why certain materials are better for insulation",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Materials used for insulation are usually chosen based on their ability to slow down the transfer of heat. Materials like glass wool, foam and other polymers are able to trap pockets of air and prevent the transfer of heat by creating an insulating barrier. The tiny air pockets prevent conduction and convection, and the thicker the insulation, the more effective it will be.",
