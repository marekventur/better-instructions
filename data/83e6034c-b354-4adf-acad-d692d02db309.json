  "output": "String theory is a branch of theoretical physics that attempts to explain the fundamental building blocks of the universe, such as matter and energy, with one unified theory. It proposes that very small vibrating strings are the fundamental objects that make up everything in the universe, including particles and forces. In string theory, these strings vibrate at different frequencies, determining the properties of particles. The theory unifies gravity, the other three fundamental forces, and provides insight into many unsolved mysteries in physics. It is currently the most promising approach to forming a theory of everything.",
