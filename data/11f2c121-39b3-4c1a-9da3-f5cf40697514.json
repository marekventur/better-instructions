  "input": "The goal is to create a one-of-a-kind burger",
  "output": "1. Ask a question: How can I create a one-of-a-kind hamburger?\n2. Do background research: Research cookbooks and online recipes to look for ideas, as well as ingredients, cooking techniques, etc.\n3. Form a hypothesis: If I use the right combination of ingredients and cooking techniques, I can create a one-of-a-kind hamburger.\n4. Test the hypothesis: Experiment with different ingredient combinations and cooking techniques to create the hamburger.\n5. Analyze the data and draw a conclusion: Based on the results of the experiments, assess whether a one-of-a-kind hamburger has been created. \n6. Communicate the results: Share the successful burger with friends and family, or post details online for others to enjoy.",
