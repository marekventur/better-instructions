  "instruction": "Develop an algorithm to sort data.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm should be able to sort data based on one or multiple fields, such as date, name, or size. The algorithm should be able to accommodate different data types, e.g. integers, strings, etc. It should be able to sort the data based on ascending or descending order, and provide an option to limit the number of entries that will be sorted. The algorithm should be able to handle input data that may contain errors or missing values. If necessary, it should be able to make educated guesses about such input data. Finally, it should provide an output that is consistent and gives accurate results.",
