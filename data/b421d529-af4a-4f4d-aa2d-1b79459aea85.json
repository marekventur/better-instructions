  "input": "",
  "output": "The Doppler effect is a phenomenon in which the frequency of a wave is perceived to be different depending on the motion of the observer relative to the source of the wave. This effect is caused by the law of conservation of energy; when a source of waves and an observer move towards each other, the frequency seen by the observer is increased, while when they move away from each other the frequency seen is decreased. This effect is commonly seen in sound and light waves, leading to a change in pitch heard or a change in the color of light seen.",
