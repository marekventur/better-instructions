  "output": "A sorting algorithm for an array of integers in descending order is as follows:\n\n1. Set a pointer to the first element in the array.\n2. Compare the element currently pointed at with the rest of the elements in the array.\n3. Swap the elements if a larger element is encountered. \n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the end of the array is reached.\n5. Move the pointer to the next element and repeat steps 2-4 until the array is sorted.",
