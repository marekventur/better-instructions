  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the key ways to protect a Unix system from external threats is by using robust authentication methods. This means setting up strong passwords and/or multi-factor authentication, such as using a biometric identifier or a code sent to a user's mobile device. Additionally, firewall rules should be set up to limit access to the system and its resources, to block malicious traffic, and to monitor incoming traffic for suspicious activity. Regular security updates should also be installed to ensure that patches for any newly discovered vulnerabilities are applied. Finally, regular system backups should be taken to ensure that the system can be recovered in the event of an attack.",
