  "input": "",
  "output": "The biggest difference between an AI system and a human system is that the former is powered by machines, while the latter is powered by the cognitive functions of humans. AI systems use algorithms to automate different processes, while humans use their intelligence and intuition to make decisions. AI systems are limited by their programing, while humans can make decisions that go beyond the scope of their knowledge or experience. AI systems can perform repetitive tasks quickly and accurately, while humans can make rapid decisions that require creative problem-solving. AI systems are constantly improving, while humans have the potential for growth and improvement through the acquisition of more knowledge and experience.",
