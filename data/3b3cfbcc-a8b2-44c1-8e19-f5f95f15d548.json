  "output": "One sustainable energy option for a small town is solar power. Solar energy can be harvested by installing photovoltaic panels on rooftops or other structures and then sending the collected energy to the local utility company. Solar energy is clean, renewable, and cost-effective. It is also an excellent choice for small towns and rural areas where access to other forms of energy is limited.",
