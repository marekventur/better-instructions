  "input": "",
  "output": "One potential risk of gene therapy technology is that unintended changes to the genetic code could be made, which could lead to unexpected outcomes. For example, unintended changes could increase the risk of cancer or cause unintended allergic reactions. Additionally, gene therapy technology cannot be reversed, so any mistakes could be permanent.",
