  "output": "The purpose of manual data entry is to manually input data into a computer system or database. Manual data entry is useful when information needs to be inserted into a system or database from another source, such as a paper document, electronic image, or audio recording, and when automated entry processes are not available or not accurate enough. Manual data entry is also commonly used to enter information into computer systems with specialized fields or formats which automated processes are not able to recognize.",
