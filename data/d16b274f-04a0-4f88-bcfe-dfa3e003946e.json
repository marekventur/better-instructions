  "input": "",
  "output": "The Euro became one of the world's major currencies mainly due to the European Union (EU), which was established in 1993. The EU provided a unified economic and monetary policy that allowed for a free flow of capital and services, which promoted trade and investment opportunities throughout Europe. The adoption of the Euro as a common currency also provided a stable and predictable currency exchange rate, making it easier for businesses to trade internationally. Additionally, the Euro became a major currency due to the fact that it is the second-largest reserve currency and the most common currency for international payments.",
