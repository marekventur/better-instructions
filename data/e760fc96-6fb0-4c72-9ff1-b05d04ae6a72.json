  "input": "",
  "output": "The Earth\u2019s tilt creates seasonal shifts in the climate by changing the amount of exposure to direct energy from the Sun. In summer, the Northern Hemisphere has more direct exposure causing the climate to be warmer; in winter, the Southern Hemisphere has more direct exposure and is warmer. This tilt also affects wind patterns and ocean currents.",
