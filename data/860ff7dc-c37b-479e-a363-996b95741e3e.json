  "input": "[(3,7),(2,2),(2,5),(1,3),(8,6)]",
  "output": "The K-means algorithm is used to find clusters in data by assigning similar data points to the same cluster. \n\nThe algorithm starts by randomly assigning the data points to two clusters. Then, it will calculate the centroid of each cluster by taking the mean of the points in each cluster. The centroid of cluster 1 is (2.4,4.4) and of cluster 2 is (4.8,5.2).\n\nThe algorithm then iterates between two steps. The first step is to assign each data point to the closest cluster centroid by calculating the Euclidean distance. The second step is to update the centroid of each cluster by taking the mean of the points of each cluster.\n\nAfter the algorithm has converged (i.e. no change in the location of the centroid of each cluster), each data point has been assigned to a cluster, and the clusters can be used for analysis. In the given example, the final cluster assignments are [(3,7) \u2192 Cluster 1, (2,2) \u2192 Cluster 1, (2,5) \u2192 Cluster 1, (1,3) \u2192 Cluster 1, (8,6) \u2192 Cluster 2].",
