  "input": "",
  "output": "If I were stranded on a deserted island, I would first make sure I had a safe place to rest and access to clean water. I would then take some time to explore the island, looking for food sources, fresh water, and any other resources I could find. I would also work on building some kind of shelter, using whatever materials I could find. Lastly, I would set up some kind of signal to try and attract attention and hopefully get rescued.",
