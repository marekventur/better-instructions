  "output": "The Supreme Court granted a request from Louisiana on Monday to stay a block of a law that would require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The decision follows a split 5-4 ruling in June that struck down a similar law in Texas. The decision is being seen as a further move to chip away at the Roe v. Wade ruling, which guarantees the right to abortion. Opponents of the Louisiana law argued that it would restrict access to the procedure, and Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four justices in the minority to vote in favor of the stay.",
