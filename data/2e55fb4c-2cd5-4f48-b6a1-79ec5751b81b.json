  "output": "Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate. She is known for human rights advocacy for education and for women in her native Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northwest Pakistan, where the local Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Her advocacy has grown into an international movement, and she has co-founded the Malala Fund, a non-profit organisation, and in 2013 co-authored the book I am Malala. As a result of her advocacy, youth activism was recognised by the Pakistani government which in 2013 enacted the first Right to Education Bill.",
