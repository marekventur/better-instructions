  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a young man named John who fell deeply in love with a beautiful woman named Sarah. They had a beautiful relationship full of love and laughter. But one day, tragedy struck. Sarah was diagnosed with a terminal illness and, despite all their hoping, praying, and fighting, Sarah passed away.\n\nJohn was devastated, and felt lost and alone. He turned inward, away from the world he once knew, as he mourned the death of the woman he loved. In time, however, he was able to move forward and find his own way again, and he never lost the love and joy he felt when he was with Sarah. Even though she had gone, the love and memories she left behind still live inside him.",
