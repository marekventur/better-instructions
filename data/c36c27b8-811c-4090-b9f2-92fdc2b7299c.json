  "output": "Data mining is the process of collecting, organizing, and analyzing large sets of data to discover patterns, trends, and correlations that may be useful in making decisions. Data analysis involves using data to identify insights, test theories, and inform business strategy. Data mining tools are used to analyze large datasets, while data analysis tools are used to summarize and interpret the data. Data mining typically requires greater computing power and sophisticated algorithms to identify relevant trends, while data analysis typically requires simpler and more manual steps, such as filtering and sorting.",
