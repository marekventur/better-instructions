  "output": "The primary role of artificial intelligence in contact tracing is to help identify and limit the spread of disease by systematically tracking possible contacts with an infected person. AI-based algorithms are used to measure epidemiological data collected from various sources, track human movement and population flow, observe and analyze behavior, and provide recommendations to health authorities for further advancement of contact tracing. AI can help in automating contact tracing which can improve its speed and accuracy, allowing health workers and epidemiologists to take preemptive measures before an epidemic can significantly spread.",
