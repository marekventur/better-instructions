  "input": "",
  "output": "A meal consumed by someone living in poverty would likely consist of a few simple and inexpensive ingredients. Typically, this may include dishes such as steamed rice and vegetables, a stew made from potatoes and onions, fried eggs, or a bowl of noodles and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables, if available, are usually consumed for snacks during the day and night, as well as for breakfast. Meats and dairy products may be a rarity. Many of these meals are also often prepared with limited access to cooking equipment, as well as limited resources for purchasing ingredients.",
