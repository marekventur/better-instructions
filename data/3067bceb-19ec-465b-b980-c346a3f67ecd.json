  "output": "A new report by the International Energy Agency reports that 2020 will be a record year for renewable energy. The growth in solar, wind, and other renewables is largely due to supportive government policies as well as cost and technology improvements. Renewables are now the second largest form of energy, representing 28% of global energy consumption. This is expected to grow over the next decade, with the possibility of reaching over a third of energy consumption by 2030.",
