  "output": "The beauty of nature abounds,\nUnending rivers and boundless grounds. \nThe vivid trees, the drifting clouds,\nThe majestic mountains, so proud. \n\nThe hidden valleys, evergreen,\nWhere joy and peace are to be seen.\nThe splendid sunshine, free and clear,\nOn rolling hills that seem so near.\n\nThe crystal streams, the glistening lake,\nThe glorious colors that nature makes. \nThe grandeur of this world so vast,\nAs far as my eye can see at last.",
