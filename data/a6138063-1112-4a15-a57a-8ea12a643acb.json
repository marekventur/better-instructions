  "instruction": "Give three reasons why an AI-driven job market poses a threat.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "There are several threats posed by an AI-driven job market. First, automation on a large scale has the potential to replace human labor, resulting in millions of job losses. Second, advances in AI technology could lead to greater inequity in the job market, as AI often stands to benefit those with the most resources. Finally, AI-driven decisions in the job market could lead to biased outcomes due to underlying datasets that may not be fair or representative of humans.",
