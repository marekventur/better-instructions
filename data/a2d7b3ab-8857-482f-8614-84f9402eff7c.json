  "output": "A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a service that creates a secure connection to the internet, allowing users to access private networks and resources, while hiding their true IP address and location. It is typically used to keep data secure when using public networks, or to access restricted or censored content. VPNs help to prevent unauthorized access, interception of data and online tracking, as well as providing encrypted access to businesses\u2019 networks.",
