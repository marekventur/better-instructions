  "output": "Alice had been living on her own for quite some time now. She enjoyed her independence, but every once in awhile, she would reminisce about her grandmother and the stories she used to tell her. Much to her surprise, one afternoon there was a knock on her door, and when she opened it, there stood her grandmother with a big smile on her face. She had come to pay her a surprise visit. Alice welcomed her with open arms and invited her in. As they embraced, the stories from her childhood flooded back. Alice's grandmother asked her to come and stay with her, and while Alice was hesitant at first, she eventually agreed. For the next few months, they spent their days laughing, reminiscing, and sharing stories. When her grandmother eventually left, she left Alice with a present that she had been keeping for years - a gift she was only allowed to open when she felt ready.\n\nAlice had always treasured the moments she spent with her grandmother and the present was a lasting reminder of those joyful times.",
