  "output": "I wake up each morning with a sense of purpose,\nTo find freedom wherever I traverse.\nI strive to grasp it with all my might,\nWith courage I search for the path that's bright.\n\nMy thoughts run wild and are unbound,\nEnvisioning the world that I have found.\nA free world of peace, truth and love,\nThese are qualities that I am striving for.\n\nMy hope for freedom shall never die,\nUnyielding, I'll reach for the distant sky.\nIn a chorus of courage I will soon sing,\nUntil freedom for all shall bring.",
