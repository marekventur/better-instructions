  "input": "",
  "output": "A monopoly is a market structure where there is only one seller of a good or service. An oligopoly is a market structure where there are only a few sellers of a good or service. In a monopoly, the one seller has complete and total control over the market and can set prices and output quantity. In an oligopoly, the few sellers have some control over the market, but competition between them keeps prices at a lower level and can shape output quantities. Monopolies are generally more efficient than oligopolies because the single seller does not have to worry about competition. However, in oligopolies, the few sellers can usually reach agreements on the quantity of output and pricing strategies, allowing them to gain higher profits at the expense of consumers.",
