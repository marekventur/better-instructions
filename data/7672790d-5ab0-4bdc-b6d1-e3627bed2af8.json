  "input": "Spring is a time of renewal. The plants are budding, the birds are singing, and the sun is shining. After a long winter, it is a time of hope and new beginnings.",
  "output": "After the winter's dark and bleak,\nA time of warmth, vigor, life, and peak.\nThe world blooms anew with rebirth,\nAfter the chill has given dearth.\n\nThe air grows pure, the birds sing sweet,\nThe sun casts down its golden heat.\nA breeze fills up and carries hope,\nThe memories of winter, now can't cope.\n\nThe flowers grow, the plants do rise,\nColours splash, and freshness skies.\nA hint of life, a buckling start,\nA beaming light, a brand-new heart.\n\nSpring comes upon, the polar night,\nA sprout of life, and a sober sight.\nFirst step to renewal, and new beginnings,\nA grand thought, of sweet awakenings.",
