  "input": "",
  "output": "Single-use plastic straws have a detrimental environmental impact as they cannot be recycled and usually end up in landfills or oceans where they can take hundreds of years to decompose. Plastic straws are also a danger to marine life, as turtles, seabirds and other animals can consume them and become ill or perish. Furthermore, the creation of plastic straws from petroleum products can release harmful chemicals into the atmosphere.",
