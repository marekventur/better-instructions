  "instruction": "Generate a user interface design for a mobile phone app that helps people track their daily tasks and to-do lists.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The app should have an intuitive and simple user interface. It should include a calendar, a task list, and a reminders feature. The calendar should feature interactive buttons that indicate progress towards completion of each task and deadlines, allowing users to quickly see which tasks have been completed or have yet to be completed. The task list should be sorted according to priority, urgency, and/or type, and should allow users to add, complete, and/or delete tasks from the list. The reminders feature should allow users to set reminders for individual tasks, as well as general reminders for the app\u2019s events and deadlines.",
