  "instruction": "Design an experiment to prove the concept of self-fulfilling prophecies.",
  "input": "No input",
  "output": "To prove the concept of self-fulfilling prophecies, my experiment would involve a control group of subjects who are told that the experiment will test their problem-solving skills and an experimental group that is told that the experiment will test their creativity. The subjects will then be placed in a room with a problem to solve and asked to come up with a solution. The results of the experiment will be judged based on the perceptions of the experimenter. My hypothesis is that the experimental group, which believes that they are being tested for creativity, will be seen as more creative and thus will have better results than the control group.",
