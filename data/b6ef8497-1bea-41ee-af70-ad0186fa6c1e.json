  "input": "",
  "output": "Cultural appropriation is the process of taking elements of a culture which is not one\u2019s own and using them in a way which lacks respect and understanding for the context, history, and significance of those elements. It often happens when a dominant group adopts elements of a marginalized group\u2019s culture. This can be seen in fashion, music, cuisine, language, and other aspects of culture. Such appropriation typically results in the devaluation of the culture or cultural elements being appropriated, as they are often seen as trendy, while the people who created them are still marginalised and excluded.",
