  "output": "An example of an artificial intelligence use case is healthcare. AI can be used to analyze large amounts of medical data to identify patterns and diagnose diseases faster and more accurately. AI can be used to develop algorithms that detect anomalies in medical scans and alert the doctor in case of a potential emergency. AI can also be used to provide personalized treatment plans to patients, helping doctors make sure patients receive the most appropriate treatment. Additionally, AI can help with administrative tasks such as billing and scheduling.",
