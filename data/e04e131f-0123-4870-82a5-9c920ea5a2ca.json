  "instruction": "Explain the concept of Heuristic Evaluation",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Heuristic evaluation is a process used to identify usability issues with a product or system. It involves human experts reviewing and analyzing the user interface, taking into account various usability criteria. The heuristic evaluation process involves assessing the user interface according to an established set of usability principles, or heuristics. The aim of heuristic evaluation is to identify any potential usability guarantees and to provide potential solutions and recommendations. The heuristics used in the evaluation process can be based on established usability principles (such as Jakob Nielsen\u2019s 10 Usability Heuristics) or may be tailored to the system or product being evaluated. The evaluation is then presented in the form of a report that outlines the potential usability issues and recommendations.",
