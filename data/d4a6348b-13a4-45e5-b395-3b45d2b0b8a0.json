  "output": "Step 1: Traverse the 2D array and create a trie of all possible words.\n\nStep 2: Starting from the top-left character, perform a deep-first search for all valid words.\n\nStep 3: For each traversal, check if the current character is present in the trie.\n\nStep 4: If the character is present, mark the character as visited and add it to the current word and recursively go through all its neighbors.\n\nStep 5: If the character is not present in the trie, mark it as unvisited and return.\n\nStep 6: If the current character forms a valid word in the trie, print it.\n\nStep 7: Continue the search with other characters until the whole array is traversed.",
