  "output": "Verse 1:\nOh, I'm just an ordinary man, playing the guitar in a band\nI got no dreams of grandeur that I'm vying for\nAnd I find solace in that, as I'm living my life and I'm pushing the start\nJust hoping for the best, down to the core\n\nChorus:\nSo hush, don't fret and I will go on, life can still be so sweet beyond the next song\nStrive for the courage to free the world from all its broken dreams\nAnd stay true in my heart, to what I have always heard so long\n\nVerse 2:\nNo, I'm not searching for glory or looking for fame, I'm simply just trying to find my place\nAnd though nobody cares, I'm here to be apart of the race\nAnd I still believe in the beauty of love\nIt's what keeps us all going even when the world gives us a shove\nSo I strive to be strong, even though that feeling never lasts\n\nChorus:\nSo hush, don't fret and I will go on, life can still be so sweet beyond the next song\nStrive for the courage to free the world from all its broken dreams\nAnd stay true in my heart, to what I have always heard so long",
