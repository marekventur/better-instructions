  "input": "",
  "output": "Two strengths of Python as a programming language are its scalability and its efficiency. It can handle both small, simple tasks and more complex, larger tasks. It is also relatively easy to learn.\n\nTwo weaknesses of Python are its slow speed and lack of checking for errors. Its speed is slower than other languages such as C, C++, and Java which means it can be difficult to work with large datasets. It also doesn't check for errors which leads to mistakes in code and can be difficult to debug.",
