  "output": "A rocket is a vehicle that is powered by propulsive burn of rocket fuel. Rockets provide the most efficient way of achieving high speeds and are used for launching spacecraft and other high-speed vehicles into orbit or on interplanetary trajectories. The main parts of a rocket include the fuel, an engine to create thrust, and a body that acts as a guidance system. Rockets typically use either solid or liquid fuel, with solid fuel providing more consistent thrust, while liquid fuel allows for more control over the rocket\u2019s speed and direction.",
