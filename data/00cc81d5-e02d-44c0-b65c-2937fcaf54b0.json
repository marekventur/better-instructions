  "input": "",
  "output": "The most important benefit of using a Class in Java is code reuse. Classes help to keep code organized and maintainable. They allow you to create objects that are instances of the same class with the same properties, methods and code. This allows you to write code that is quickly reusable and reliable. Classes also allow you to define specific properties and behaviors and limit how they are accessed and used by other code. This can provide a great advantage when coding large and complex applications.",
