  "output": "The Big Bang Theory is an cosmological theory that suggests the universe was created from an extremely dense and hot state. This state expanded rapidly and is currently still expanding. It is believed that all of the galaxies, stars, and other matter were created from this single hot, dense point. According to the Big Bang Theory, the universe started about 13.7 billion years ago and has evolved over time. This theory is widely accepted by the scientific community, though there is ongoing research to refine aspects of the Big Bang Theory.",
