  "output": "Once, I had to travel to a remote location to meet with a client but the flight was delayed. I was stuck in the airport with no way of contacting the client and worried about missing the meeting. After a few hours, I decided to rent a car and drove to the destination late at night. It was a long and exhausting drive but I was relieved to make it on time to the meeting.  Through resourceful problem solving, I was able to arrive at the client's office on time.",
