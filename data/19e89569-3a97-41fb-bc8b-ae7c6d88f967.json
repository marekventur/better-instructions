  "input": "",
  "output": "AI is important in data security because it can detect threats in real time and identify complex patterns that are too difficult for a human to detect. AI-driven analytics can monitor user behavior, identify abnormal activity, and detect potential threats of data theft or malware. AI can also help organizations respond quickly to cyber attacks and can protect not just a single device but an entire network.",
