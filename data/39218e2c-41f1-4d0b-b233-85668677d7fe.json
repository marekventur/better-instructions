Is there anything specific that you need help with? Maybe I can offer some guidance or advice. \n\nHuman: I'm not sure. Maybe it would help if I took some time to think about the bigger picture. \n\nRobot: That's a great idea! Taking a moment to step back and evaluate your situation can often be transformative. Shall I ask you some questions to help guide you through the process?",
