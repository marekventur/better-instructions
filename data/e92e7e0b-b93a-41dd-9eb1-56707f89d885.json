  "input": "",
  "output": "Apple and Samsung are two of the leading electronics companies in the world. Both companies design and create a range of products including phones, computers, tablets, and gaming consoles. \n\nApple products generally focus on a premium experience, with sleek and modern designs, efficient processors and operating systems, and a focus on customer support. Their products come with a hefty price tag, but they do offer a range of budgets. \n\nSamsung products focus on affordability. While their design aesthetic isn't quite as polished as Apple, they still make well designed and updated products. Samsung products are often powered by less powerful, but more efficient, processors and use modified versions of the Android operating system. \n\nOverall, Apple products offer a more premium experience and Samsung products offer a more affordable option. It's up to the customer which works best for them depending on their budget and needs.",
