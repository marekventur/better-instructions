  "input": "",
  "output": "A company's budget is important because it outlines the company's course of action for the upcoming fiscal year. It serves as a plan of action for both the short term and long term, and outlines its financial goals for the year. The budget is critical for decision-making, financial planning, and performance measurement. It allows a company to make wise financial decisions, allocate resources, and set priorities. It also guides allocation of funds, evaluates progress, and measures performance. A budget is essential for staying on track financially, and helps a business maximize its potential growth.",
