  "input": "",
  "output": "A bubble sort algorithm is a type of sorting algorithm that is used to sort elements in an array. It works by looking at each element of the array and comparing it to the next element. If the first element is bigger than the second element, they are swapped. This process is repeated until the whole array is sorted. This type of sorting is one of the simplest sorting algorithms, but it can be slow if the array has many elements.",
