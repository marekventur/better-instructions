  "input": "",
  "output": "Driving while distracted by a phone creates a great risk as it can lead to a potentially deadly accident. The most common type of distracted driving involves using a mobile phone, including making calls, texting messages, using online navigation, playing media, or engaging in any other type of conversation or activity. Distracted driving can cause a driver to take their eyes off the road, take their hands off the wheel, or take their mind off driving \u2013 all of which can have dangerous, if not fatal, consequences. The distraction can result in delayed reaction times, failure to maintain control of the vehicle, or even more serious offenses, such as running a red light or stop sign. Additionally, studies have shown that talking on a hands-free device is no safer than talking on a hand-held phone and can divert a driver's attention away from driving. Therefore, driving while distracted by a phone should be avoided at all costs.",
