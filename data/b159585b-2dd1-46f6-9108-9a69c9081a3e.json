  "input": "",
  "output": "The two biggest repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic on the education system have been the move to digital learning and the widening of educational disparities. The shift to online/virtual learning has had both positive and negative impacts on students, teachers, and parents, but it has created significant disruptions and challenges for many. Furthermore, the pandemic has exacerbated existing educational disparities by pushing students from lower-income families behind even further due to limited access to technology and internet connections. In some cases, the gap between students from low- and high-income backgrounds has grown significantly.",
