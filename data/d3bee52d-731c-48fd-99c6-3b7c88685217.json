  "output": "A relationship between living organisms that is present in an ecosystem is called symbiosis. Symbiosis describes the relationship between two or more organisms that live and interact together, providing benefits to each other. Examples of symbiotic relationships include mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both organisms benefit from the association; an example of mutualism is the relationship between bees and flowers. Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one organism benefits and the other is neither harmed nor helped; an example of commensalism is between barnacles and whales. Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one organism benefits and the other is harmed; an example of parasitism is the relationship between ticks and deer.",
