  "input": "",
  "output": "Resistance training, such as weightlifting and bodyweight exercises, is the best type of exercise for building muscle mass. By creating resistance on the muscle, the muscle fibers are damaged, which repairs and rebuilds muscle fibers with more mass. Other types of exercise can be beneficial for general fitness and wellbeing, but for muscle building resistance training is the best option.",
