  "instruction": "What was the difference between regular mail and airmail in 1950?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "In 1950, regular mail involved the transport of letters by ground mail carriers such as the postman, and typically took more time for delivery when compared to airmail which was transported by airplanes. Air mail was much costlier and faster but had a size limitation for delivery. In some cases, it could take days for a letter sent by regular mail to reach its destination, while airmail could get there in a matter of hours.",
