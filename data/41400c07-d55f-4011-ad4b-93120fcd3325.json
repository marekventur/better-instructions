  "input": "",
  "output": "Decision trees have several advantages, including interpretability and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data. Decision trees provide a visual representation of the decision making process, making them easy to interpret for humans. Complex decisions can be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces and are easier to understand compared to other models, such as neural networks. Additionally, decision trees can handle both numerical and categorical data, making them more flexible than other models. Finally, they can handle missing data and provide estimates of feature importance.",
