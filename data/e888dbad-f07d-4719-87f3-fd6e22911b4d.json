  "output": "Two problems caused by global warming are extreme weather events and the depletion of fresh water sources. Extreme weather events include storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and other extreme conditions that can cause damage to infrastructure, endanger lives, and disrupt societies. The depletion of fresh water sources is caused by increased evaporation, resulting in less fresh water being available for both human and animal consumption.",
