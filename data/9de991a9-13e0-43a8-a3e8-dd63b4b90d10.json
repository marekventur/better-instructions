  "input": "Global warming is a serious problem.",
  "output": "Global warming is a serious problem that is caused by an increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human activities. This increase in greenhouse gases traps additional heat in the atmosphere, resulting in changes to the planet's climate that are beginning to cause negative impacts on natural ecosystems, human health and economic stability. To stop this destructive process, it is important for governments to implement policies that reduce the emissions of these gases.",
