It should be able to respond quickly to a range of natural language requests, such as basic information, calendar management, navigation, reminders, and task automation. A good digital assistant should also be able to learn and evolve as a user interacts with it, providing better and more tailored responses over time. It should be able to listen, follow conversation topics, and accurately interpret user needs. Finally, it should follow an ethical code, ensuring that user data is safe and secure.",
