  "input": "",
  "output": "An art deco-style bedroom has elegant and sophisticated design elements, such as exposed brick walls, low-profile furniture, mirrored accents, geometric patterns, and soft, muted color palettes. Furniture pieces often feature bold linear designs, such as geometric shapes or strong vertical lines. Accessories, such as mirrors and lamps, are usually round or curved to give the room a sense of balance. Art deco-style bedrooms also often contain rich, luxurious fabrics, such as velvet or silk, and bold metals, such as bronze and brass.",
