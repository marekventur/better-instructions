  "output": "I had been habitually biting my nails for years, and I finally decided that it was time to break the habit. I was determined to do whatever it took to break this bad habit and make healthier choices. So, I decided to start keeping my nails short and to keep them clean at all times. I also started wearing nail polish in order to make sure that I wasn't tempted to bite my nails. As time went on, I gradually stopped biting my nails until it became totally automatic and second nature.",
