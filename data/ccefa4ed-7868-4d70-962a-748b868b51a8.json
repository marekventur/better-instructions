  "output": "Deep learning has significantly changed natural language processing (NLP). It has enabled better models to accurately deal with greater complexity in language, while being able to efficiently grasp the meaning of text. Deep learning has significantly enhanced the accuracy of existing NLP tasks, including topics like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval. It has also enabled NLP systems to better understand the context in which language is used, allowing them to infer more precise meaning and accurately analyze conversational data. All in all, deep learning has revolutionized natural language processing and allowed for further progress in the field.",
