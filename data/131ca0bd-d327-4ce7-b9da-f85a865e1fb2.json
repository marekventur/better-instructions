  "output": "The protagonist of To Kill a Mockingbird, Atticus Finch, is well-known for his strong moral values and sense of justice. He instills in his children values of empathy, understanding, and fairness. He also firmly believes in the importance of honoring people\u2019s rights, regardless of their age or social position. His actions also demonstrate his commitment to truth and justice.\n\nThe antagonist, Bob Ewell, embodies much of the hatred, racism, and injustice of the 1930s South. His moral values are diametrically opposed to those of Atticus - Ewell believes that people should be judged based on the color of their skin, and that it is his privilege to do so. He is also dishonest about the circumstances surrounding Mayella\u2019s accusation of Tom Robinson. Ewell is cruel and cruel and believes that people of color should be treated with contempt. As a contrast, Atticus\u2019s moral values of justice and truth prevail over Ewell\u2019s.",
