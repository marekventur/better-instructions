  "instruction": "Describe how you would use a machine learning model to predict house prices.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A machine learning model can be used to predict house prices by using historical data about house prices in a specific region. This historical data could include factors such as the size of the house, the year it was built, the number of bedrooms, the location and the neighborhood. Using this data, a machine learning model can learn to identify patterns and correlations between these factors and the corresponding house prices. The model can then be used to predict house prices based on the new set of input data values.",
