  "output": "It was the night of Halloween, and in the small town of Cooperstown, rumors had been circulating about a haunted house near town. Everyone spoke of the house with whispered tales of strange noises, eerie lights, and terrifying figures moving about in the shadows. No one dared to approach the house on that fateful night, but Daniel was determined to face his fears and investigate. When he stepped foot onto the property, a chill ran up his spine, and he felt a wave of dread wash over him. As he moved closer to the house, he could hear strange noises coming from behind the walls. He felt his heart pounding as he made his way inside, and discovered a labyrinth of dark hallways filled with haunting shadows and ancient artifacts. All of a sudden, the lights in the house went out, and Daniel was left in complete darkness. He stumbled his way through the halls, and then he heard something that sounded like a laughter coming from the shadows. He ran as fast as he could out of the house, never looking back.",
