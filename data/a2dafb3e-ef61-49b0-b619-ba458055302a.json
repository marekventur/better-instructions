  "output": "AI is being used in both healthcare and education to automate and optimize processes, analyze massive data sets, and provide personalized recommendations. In healthcare, AI applications include diagnosing and treating diseases, predicting medical outcomes, and helping make medical decisions. In education, AI is used for personalized learning and providing real-time feedback. AI is also aiding in grading and generating learning materials. The biggest difference between the uses of AI in healthcare and education is the regulatory guidelines regarding data privacy and security that must be observed in healthcare. Additionally, the complexity of medical AI applications is typically much higher than in educational AI.",
