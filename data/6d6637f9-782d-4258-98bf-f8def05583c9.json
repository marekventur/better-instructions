  "input": "",
  "output": "The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely the momentum is known, and vice versa. This principle has been important in establishing quantum mechanics, and has been used to define the limits of predictability in the physical world.",
