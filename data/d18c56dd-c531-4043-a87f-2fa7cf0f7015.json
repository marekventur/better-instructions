  "input": "",
  "output": "Under the Trump administration, the United States withdrew from the World Health Organization, Paris Agreement, Trans-Pacific Partnership, and other international agreements, and imposed sanctions on Iran, Cuba and other countries. In opposition, President Biden has declared that America is \"back\" and ready to lead the world, and has taken a number of steps to reassure allies and reset relations with adversaries. He has rejoined the World Health Organization, extended the \"New START\" treaty, reaffirmed U.S. commitment to the Paris Agreement, initiated re-engagement with Cuba, and put greater diplomatic emphasis on countries like China, Russia, and North Korea. Biden is also pushing for more multilateral cooperation and is supporting global efforts to tackle the pandemic and climate change.",
