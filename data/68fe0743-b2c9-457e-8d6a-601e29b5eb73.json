  "output": "An algorithm to compute the factorial of an integer n would look like this:\n \n1.  Initialize a variable to 1. \n2.  Loop through all integers from 1 up to n. \n3.  For every integer i, multiply the current value of the variable by i.\n4.  When the loop ends, the value of the variable will be the factorial of n.",
