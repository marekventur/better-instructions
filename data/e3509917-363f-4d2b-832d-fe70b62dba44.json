  "instruction": "Design a program that teaches students about data structures.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "My program would introduce the fundamentals of data structures by focusing on the four main types of data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, and trees. I would start by introducing each data structure, and then reviewing its advantages and disadvantages. Next, students would learn how to implement and use each data structure. With each structure, students would build several applications and run through multiple scenarios. Finally, I would assess students on their understanding of each structure and their ability to apply it to real-world problems.",
