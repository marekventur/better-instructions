  "instruction": "How does wintering affect flowering for hazel trees?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Wintering, or vernalization, is a process by which flowering of plants is accelerated by subjecting them to low temperatures. For hazel trees, vernalization causes flower buds to form during the previous summer and fall so that the tree blooms in early spring. Vernalization also reduces flowering and nut production, which could result in a decrease in crop yield. Additionally, winters that are too cold can kill off buds, preventing flowering and fruiting the following spring.",
