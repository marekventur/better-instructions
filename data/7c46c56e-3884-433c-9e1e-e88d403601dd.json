  "input": "",
  "output": "In the United States, taxation policy is based on the idea of progressive taxation, meaning that people with higher incomes pay more in taxes than those with lower incomes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) collects federal income taxes from individuals and businesses at the federal, state and local levels. Income taxes are based on the amount of money a person or business makes, minus any deductions. The government also collects social security taxes, which are taxes set aside for programs like Social Security and Medicare. Additionally, the government imposes tariffs on certain imported goods, as well as excise taxes on certain activities like the purchase of certain products like cigarettes or alcohol.",
