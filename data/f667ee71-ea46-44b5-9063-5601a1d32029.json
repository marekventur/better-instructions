  "input": "",
  "output": "A four year economic recession can have devastating effects on a small business. Cash flow problems can arise if orders drop off, inventory costs can increase, and costumers may become more risk-adverse causing their spending habits to change. As result, a small business may experience a decrease in their customer base, which can lead to a decrease in revenue. It can become difficult to pay staff and meet loan payments in a recession and layoffs may be necessary. If a small business has not adequately prepared for a recession, it may struggle to stay afloat during this difficult economic period.",
