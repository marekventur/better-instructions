  "input": "",
  "output": "Improving your public speaking skill takes practice and dedication. Start by becoming familiar with the material you need to present, and practice it ahead of time. You can practice in front of a mirror or record yourself. You can also practice with a group of friends or join a local Toastmasters Club to practice in front of an audience. Additionally, pay attention to your body language and tone of voice - make sure to project your voice, maintain good posture, and demonstrate confidence. Finally, focus on having meaningful conversations with your audience, rather than just delivering a speech.",
