  "input": "",
  "output": "Six o'clock on a Wednesday night at the local bar is usually a mellow atmosphere; the sun setting outside, the fading sunlight still lingering through the windows and the dimly lit lamps illuminating the room. People are scattered around the bar, some sitting alone with a beverage, others in conversation with friends or on a phone call. There is always a smell of beer, wine, whiskey and cigarettes wafting through the room. The occasional laughter and snippets of conversation fills the room with a warm feeling.",
