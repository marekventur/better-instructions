  "input": "",
  "output": "The word \"freedom\" is an important concept in modern society as it reflects the autonomy and empowerment of individuals in the face of oppressive political and social systems. It is the cornerstone of democracies and human rights, allowing people to express themselves and pursue their dreams. It also serves as an example of the power of collective action, as people have used protests and other non-violent means to fight for freedoms such as the right to vote, improved labor laws, and protection against discrimination.",
