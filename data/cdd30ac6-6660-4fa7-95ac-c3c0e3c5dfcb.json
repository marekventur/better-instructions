  "output": "The likelihood of an event occurring in a small city with a population of 40,000 residents depends on the type of event and the location. The size of the city limits the number of people who can attend, so the likelihood of a large event occurring in a small city may be low. However, smaller events or ones that take place in a public park or other public area may be more popular in small cities due to the limited number of other activities available. Ultimately, the likelihood of an event occurring in a small city depends on the event organizers, their goals, and the size and needs of the city.",
