  "output": "Clayton had a tough decision to make. As a small-scale farmer, he had to choose between hiring a temporary worker to help with his summer harvest or investing in a robot that could do the same job. On one hand, the robot was significantly cheaper, but it lacked the intuition and experience that a human worker has. On the other hand, hiring a worker would require a more significant initial outlay, and he was unsure if the worker could handle the physically demanding job. Thus, he was at an impasse- how could he make the best decision?",
