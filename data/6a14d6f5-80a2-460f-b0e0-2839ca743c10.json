  "output": "Jimmy and his older sister Jenny were excited to go on a weekend camping trip with their parents. It was the first time for both of them and they couldn\u2019t wait. When they arrived at the camping site, their parents quickly set up the tent, unpacked the food and supplies and started a fire to roast s\u2019mores over. Jimmy and Jenny had a lot of fun exploring the area and playing in the nearby lake. They spent the afternoon fishing with their dad, while their mom cooked dinner. After dinner, their parents bundled everyone up in blankets and they lay side by side on the grass, looking up at the stars. Jimmy and Jenny felt so close to each other and so lucky to have each other and their parents. The camping trip was the perfect way to end summer.",
