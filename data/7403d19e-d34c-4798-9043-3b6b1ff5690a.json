  "instruction": "Identify two economic indicators and explain how they are used to assess economic performance",
  "input": "No input",
  "output": "Two examples of economic indicators that are used to assess economic performance are the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The GDP measures the total value of all goods and services produced in a given period and is used as an indicator of economic growth. The CPI measures the average change in prices paid by consumers over a period of time and is used as an indicator of inflation. Both of these indicators provide insights into the health of an economy by measuring the level of consumer demand, the cost of goods and services, and the overall health of the labor market.",
