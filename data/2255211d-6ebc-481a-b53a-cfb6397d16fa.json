  "instruction": "Explain why the results of a given survey are inaccurate.",
  "input": "The survey was conducted without a representative sample of respondents since the participants all received a monetary incentive for answering the survey questions.",
  "output": "The survey results are likely to be inaccurate because participants may answer the questions in a way in order to receive the monetary incentive, rather than giving an honest response. Without a representative sample, the survey can't accurately capture the opinions of the general population, and so the results are not reliable.",
