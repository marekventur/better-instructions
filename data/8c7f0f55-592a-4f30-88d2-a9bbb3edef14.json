  "input": "",
  "output": "Three advantages of using metal over plastic materials are: increased durability and strength, better heat resistance and insulation, and less chance of fire or chemical damage. Metal is also more resistant to deformities and cracking that can occur in plastics. It is often preferred for parts that require high precision, such as machined or turned parts. Finally, metal is recyclable and can be reused, making it more environmentally friendly than plastics.",
