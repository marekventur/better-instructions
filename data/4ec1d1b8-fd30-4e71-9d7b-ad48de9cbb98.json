  "instruction": "What is the shortest path between two given points?",
  "input": "Point A (1, 2) and Point B (-4, 2).",
  "output": "The shortest path between Point A (1,2) and Point B (-4,2) is a straight line of length 5.5 units, starting at Point A and ending at Point B. This path can be formulated as a vector equation: (x, y) = (1+t, 2) with 0 < t < 5.5. This equation can be rearranged to determine the value of the parameter t which will yield the shortest path between the two points: t = 5.5. Moving the point of origin to Point A (1,2) and substituting (1+5.5, 2) in the equation of the line gives the point of arrival, which is Point B (-4,2).",
