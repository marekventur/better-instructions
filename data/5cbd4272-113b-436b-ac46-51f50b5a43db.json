  "input": "",
  "output": "Two strategies for good communication in the workplace are open, respectful dialogue and active listening. Open and respectful dialogue involves having a two-way conversation between parties, in which both parties share their perspectives and feelings in a constructive manner. Active listening involves listening to understand, rather than to simply respond. This means asking questions to gain clarity and showing that you are actively listening with verbal and nonverbal cues such as nodding and making eye contact.",
