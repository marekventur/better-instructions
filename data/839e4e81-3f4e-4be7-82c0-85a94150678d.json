  "instruction": "Write a short argument that defends the following statement: Junk food should be banned from schools.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Junk food should be banned from schools because it does not promote healthy eating habits for students. Foods high in sugar, salt, and fat can lead to energyslumps, poor concentration, and weight gain. Eating junk food can also increase students' risk of developing chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.
