  "output": "The air was thick and heavy with the promise of a coming storm. The sky was a deep, inky black, and the only light came from a sliver of a moon. Thunder rumbled in the distance, and the wind rustled the leaves of the trees. The clouds ominously darkened as the lightning flashed and illuminated the night sky. Rain started to fall, first in sparse drops, then faster and faster until it was a steady downpour. An eerie silence descended as the storm raged, broken only by the sound of the booming thunder and crashing rain. The weather mirrored the mood of the night, a sublime mix of fear, awe and beauty.",
