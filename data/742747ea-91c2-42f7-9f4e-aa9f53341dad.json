  "input": "",
  "output": "The government should consider the impacts of climate change on other aspects of our environment such as ocean health, water quality and availability, agricultural productivity and food security, tourism, livelihoods, and infrastructure. Climate change is also likely to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes, which could further worsen the consequences of climate-related disasters on vulnerable populations. Additionally, climate change could exacerbate the spread of communicable diseases, create more intense air pollution and adversely affect mental health, and increase the risk of migration and conflict due to the displacement of people.",
