  "output": "AI has the potential to revolutionize school education and give students better learning opportunities. AI-driven technologies such as automated grading, virtual classrooms, personalized learning, and real-time feedback provide students with more engaging and supportive learning experiences. AI can also be used to generate customized curriculum for each student, helping them learn in a way that suits their individual needs better. AI can also help by providing teachers with insights into a student's performance, which can be used to provide better feedback and further tailor the curriculum. AI can also help reduce the administrative burden for teachers and help them focus more on what matters, teaching and interacting with students. AI offers many opportunities for enhancing the learning experience in schools and creating more personalized learning environments.",
