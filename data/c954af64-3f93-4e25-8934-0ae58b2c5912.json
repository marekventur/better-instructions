  "input": "",
  "output": "Self-directed learning is important because it empowers learners to take ownership of their education. With self-directed learning, learners are encouraged to take initiative and develop their own goals and find resources to achieve them. This type of learning also encourages learners to take risks, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills that are essential for success. Self-directed learning builds confidence, encourages curiosity, and promotes independent thinking.",
