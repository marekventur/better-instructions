  "input": "",
  "output": "When two people cooperate to solve a problem, they divide up tasks, sharing the work and leveraging each other's strengths and abilities in order to achieve the best result possible. Communication is key to successful cooperation, as each party must be aware of what the other is doing and be able to provide feedback in order to facilitate the creative process. Additionally, there must be trust between the two parties, as working together requires understanding that each is seeking the same goal. Finally, both parties must have an understanding of their part in the situation and are willing to compromise if necessary in order to reach their mutual objective.",
