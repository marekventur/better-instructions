  "output": "Dark matter is a form of matter that is hypothesized to exist but is difficult to observe directly. It is thought to make up over 80% of matter in the universe, yet its exact composition remains mysterious. Dark matter interacts with normal matter only through gravity, making it difficult to detect and study through traditional observational techniques.",
