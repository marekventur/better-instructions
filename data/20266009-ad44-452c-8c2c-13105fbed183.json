  "input": "",
  "output": "The four main goals of project management are scope management, time management, cost management, and quality management. Project scope defines what tasks or capabilities need to be completed to achieve the project's final goal. Time management looks at the overall timeline for the project, and identifies ways to complete the project on time and within budget. Cost management looks at the best ways to use the available resources and maximize the project's return on investment. Quality management focuses on ensuring that the products and services produced during the project meet the project's requirements and adhere to industry standards.",
