  "output": "For a cocktail party, the best outfit would be something that is stylish and fashionable. A dressy cocktail dress or suit would be ideal, as would dressy slacks or trousers and a tailored blouse. Shoes should be elegant and fashionable, such as pumps or heels for a woman, or polished dress shoes for a man. Accessories should be kept minimal and tasteful, such as a nice watch or a statement necklace or earrings.",
