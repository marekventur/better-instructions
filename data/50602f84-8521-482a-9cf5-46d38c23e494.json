  "output": "In the distant future, the sun shone down on a strange, empty world. There were no humans around to enjoy its warmth. The plants and trees grew tall in the absence of human hands and feet. The gentle breeze rustled through the strange, empty fields, where no one had ever stepped foot.\n\nThe ocean spread out before it, the waves crashing endlessly on the desolate shore. There were no ships or humans to enjoy the tranquility of the sea. The sky above was eerily silent, no airplanes or voices to disrupt the peace.\n\nThe once bustling cities had crumbled away in the millennia without humans to maintain them. Everywhere there were signs of the once-great cities that had flourished in the presence of humans. Now, they were nothing more than ruins to be explored by birds and small creatures.\n\nThe world had changed drastically since humans had disappeared, but nature had taken advantage of the opportunity to find a balance. Without the interference of humans, the world slowly continued on its course. No one was left to notice the changes, but that didn't stop them from taking place.\n\nThe distant future had no humans, but it was a world of its own. A world of peace and beauty, where nature could return to its rightful place. A world in which a distant civilization could have once thrived.",
