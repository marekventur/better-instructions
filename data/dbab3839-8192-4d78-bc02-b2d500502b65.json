  "instruction": "What is the molecular structure of water?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The molecular structure of water is H2O, meaning two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to an oxygen atom. The oxygen atom has two lone pairs of electrons, which give water an overall bent molecular geometry. This gives water a polar character, with a partial negative charge near the oxygen atom, and a partial positive charge on the hydrogen atoms. This is also what gives water many of its unique properties, such as its high surface tension and high boiling point.",
