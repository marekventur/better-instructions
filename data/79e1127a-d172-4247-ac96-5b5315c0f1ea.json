  "input": "",
  "output": "Over the past decade, search engine technology has evolved from primarily relying on simple text-based algorithms to utilizing more sophisticated technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing. Initially, search engines could only scan text for keywords and results were often limited and unreliable. More recently, advances in AI and machine learning have enabled search engines to understand human language and user intent to provide more accurate results. This has been further developed with the advent of voice search and more intuitive features like Google Knowledge Graph and Bing Visual Search.",
