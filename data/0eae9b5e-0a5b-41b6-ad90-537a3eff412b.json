  "output": "Advantages of using a GPT model: \n1. GPT models are capable of generating natural language text that is close to human-level quality. \n2. GPT models can generate large amounts of text quickly and efficiently. \n3. GPT models are capable of understanding complex semantical patterns in a language. \n\nDisadvantages of using a GPT model:\n1. GPT models require extensive training data to produce good quality text. \n2. GPT models can generate nonsensical or incorrect output if the input is not properly formatted. \n3. GPT models can be difficult to debug, as errors are not always immediately apparent.",
