  "input": "",
  "output": "The consumer\u2019s decision-making process can be broken down into five key stages; need recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision, and post-purchase evaluation. Firstly, the consumer will recognise their need for a product or service. Next, they will carry out a search for information to aid their decision-making. During the evaluation process, they will compare the pros and cons of different products or services, before making a purchase decision. Finally, the consumer will evaluate their satisfaction with their purchase after the transaction has taken place.",
