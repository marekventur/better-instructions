  "output": "Here is a list of questions that can be used to evaluate a machine learning model: \n- How accurate is the model in predicting results? \n- Does the model generalize well to new situations? \n- Does it capture the underlying trends in the data? \n- Is it overfitting or underfitting the data?\n- Does it form interpretable clusters? \n- Does it scale for large datasets? \n- Is the model robust to new data? \n- Is there any bias in the model?\n- Does the model learn from mistakes? \n- Is the model suitable for the task at hand? \n- Does it use the given data efficiently? \n- What is the complexity of its features? \n- How easy is it to implement and deploy the model in production? \n- What resources (time or money) are required to maintain the model? \n- Is the model easily interpretable? \n- Is the model interpretable when compared to other models? \n- How good is the model at handling noisy data? \n- How quickly can the model make a prediction? \n- Is the model making valid assumptions? \n- Does the model provide useful insights? \n- Are the results of the model reliable? \n- How does the model compare against other models in the same domain?",
