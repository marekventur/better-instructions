  "input": "",
  "output": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification tasks. To use a SVM classifier, the data set is first split into training and test sets. The training data is then used to build a model by finding the hyperplanes that separate the different classes. Finally, the model is tested on the test data to evaluate its accuracy.",
