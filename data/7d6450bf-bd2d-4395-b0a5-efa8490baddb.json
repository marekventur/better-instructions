  "input": "\"<noinput>\"",
  "output": "Using transitional words and phrases helps to smoothly link sentences, paragraphs, and ideas together in writing. They can emphasize an idea, signal a transition, or create a relationship between two ideas. Transitions provide an opportunity to show relationships between facts, thoughts, and ideas in writing. They can help ensure that the text flows coherently, helping readers better understand and interpret the written material. Transitions provide an important structural role in writing, helping readers to easily follow the author's thoughts.",
