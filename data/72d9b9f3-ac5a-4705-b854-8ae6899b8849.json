  "instruction": "Make an argument for why vegetarianism is better for humans.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Vegetarianism is better for humans because it is a healthier diet, reduces harm to animals, and can benefit the environment. Eating a vegetarian diet has been shown to decrease risk of several chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Additionally, being vegetarian reduces the number of animals used for food, which reduces suffering and death of animals. Finally, a vegetarian diet can help reduce our carbon footprint, as it uses fewer resources to produce plant-based foods.",
