  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to increase your speed when reading new material is to use the SQ3R method. SQ3R stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review. First, Survey the material and try to identify the most important points. Second, form questions about the material you read. Third, Read the material while focusing on the answers to the questions you've asked. Fourth, Recite what you've read out loud or summarize it in your own words.Finally, Review the material, ensuring that you can recall the information later. Following this approach helps you not only read more quickly, but also helps you process and comprehend the material more effectively.",
