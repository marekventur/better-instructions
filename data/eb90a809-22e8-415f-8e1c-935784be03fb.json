  "input": "",
  "output": "Social media has had a huge impact on the way people communicate. It has allowed us to stay connected to people around the world easily and quickly, no matter how far apart we are. People can communicate with each other instantly and share things in an instant, without having to wait for mail to arrive. It has enabled people to express themselves freely in many ways, such as with photos, videos, and written messages. Social media also has made it easier to stay informed with the latest news and trends. Furthermore, it has allowed people to build relationships online, which could potentially lead to in-person meetings or even friendships. Social media has revolutionized the way people interact, and its effect on communication will continue to evolve over time.",
