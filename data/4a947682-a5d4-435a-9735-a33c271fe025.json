  "input": "A stitch in time saves nine.",
  "output": "This proverb is meant to emphasize the importance of addressing small issues immediately rather than waiting and letting the issue grow. For example, if a loose button is found on a shirt, it's often easier and quicker to sew it back on rather than leave it be and potentially risk the entire shirt falling apart in the future.",
