  "input": "",
  "output": "The role of a data scientist differs from a software engineer in several ways. A data scientist is responsible for developing data models, performing analysis and interpreting data to extract useful insights and trends. Additionally, data scientists are often tasked with creating algorithms and tools to collect, clean, and store data. In contrast, software engineers focus on engineering computer systems and writing software programs. They create architectures, design applications and performance tests, and develop systems to address user and system needs. Data scientists and software engineers are both important roles in any organization, but their focus and responsibilities differ.",
