  "input": "",
  "output": "Having a diverse workforce in the workplace can help drive innovation by introducing different perspectives, experiences, and skills. It can help uncover blind spots and provide insights that may not have been identified when there is a lack of diversity. In addition, teams with different backgrounds are more likely to challenge the status quo and come up with fresh solutions to complex problems. Furthermore, bringing together people from different walks of life often leads to greater collaboration, creativity and productivity.",
