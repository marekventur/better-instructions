  "input": "",
  "output": "Chatbots can be used in customer service to provide customer support and quickly answer common inquiries. Customers can interact with the chatbot in real-time, and the chatbot can provide answers to frequently asked questions, or search customer support databases for more detailed answers to customer inquiries.\n\nThe chatbot can also be used to evaluate customer satisfaction, by prompting customers to rate their experience and provide feedback at the end of the conversation. This feedback can be used to improve customer service and identify areas in need of improvement. In addition, customers can be given options to easily connect to live customer service agents if their inquiries are more involved.",
