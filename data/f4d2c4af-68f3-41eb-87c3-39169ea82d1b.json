  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the debate between liberalism and traditionalism",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The debate between liberalism and traditionalism revolves around two different perspectives of the world. Liberals favor an expansive view of government involvement, often advocating for increased rights for individuals, more equitable distribution of resources, and the pursuit of progressive social causes. Traditionalists, on the other hand, seek to preserve existing foundations such as existing family structures, religious precepts, and economic practices. They also seek to limit the scope and power of government, and advocate for minimum intervention of the state. Despite their vast differences in certain areas, both liberalism and traditionalism share the goal of increasing opportunity and the good of society.",
