  "output": "The fresh air, a rushing breeze,\nGrass that dances among the trees.\nA moment of joy, a moment of peace,\nFinding solace in the great outdoors, its bliss \n\nThe sound of birds, the sound of leaves,\nColors of sunset, colors of dreams.\nThe warmth of summer, the winter\u2019s chill,\nOut in nature, life is fulfilled.\n \nThe sweet smell, a salty sea,\nA wilderness that\u2019s calling me.\nThe feeling of being free and wild,\nA sense of peace, a sense that's mild. \n \nThe beauty of nature, it\u2019s a playground,\nAn adventure awaits, a feeling profound.\nOutdoors fills the soul with life and laughter,\nBefore all else, its joy ever after.",
