  "output": "The sleuthing detective Sam walked into the dimly lit alleyway. Taking out his magnifying glass, he began to investigate the scene. He noticed a faint hint of lipstick on a nearby trash can and went to investigate further. Suddenly, he heard a loud smash and spun around to see a man running away. With no evidence to suggest otherwise, Sam concluded that the man was the one responsible for the crime. He quickly phoned the station and gave them the details of his suspect. \n\nLittle did he know that this was just the start of a long and complex investigation, but Sam was determined to solve the case no matter how long it took.",
