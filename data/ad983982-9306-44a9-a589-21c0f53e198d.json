  "output": "I was walking through the woods when I saw a large black bear. My heart skipped a beat as I noticed it was about ten feet away from me. It seemed to be aware of my presence and was standing still, gazing straight at me with its deep dark eyes. I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized I was face to face with a wild animal. I stayed still and hoped it would just pass by, but instead the bear took one step towards me, and then another, until we were barely two feet away from each other.",
