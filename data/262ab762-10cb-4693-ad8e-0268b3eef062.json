  "input": "",
  "output": "Panning for gold is the process of separating gold particles from other material in a stream or river. The process involves scooping sediment into a pan, then agitating it in a panning motion with water so that the lighter material is washed away and the gold particles remain heavy and settle to the bottom. Once all the lighter material has been washed away, the pan is shaken and allowed to settle, then the gold is poured into a container.",
