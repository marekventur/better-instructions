  "output": "A restaurant kitchen typically contains a number of large, professional grade appliances and cooking tools. The walls are often brightly lit and the floors are hard wearing and easy to clean. Common kitchen equipment includes refrigerators, ovens, grills, fryers, mixers, and food processors. Large preparation areas are usually lined with countertops and supplies of ingredients. There may also be a separate dishwashing area. In the main cooking area, there is usually a central island of ranges and pots, with separate stations for different types of cuisine.",
