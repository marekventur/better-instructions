  "output": "Organic chemistry is the study of molecules containing carbon, while biochemistry focuses on chemical processes and reactions involving biological molecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. Organic chemists primarily study the synthesis and reaction of molecules containing carbon, while biochemists focus on the function and regulation of these molecules in living organisms. Additionally, organic chemists may focus on the synthesis of molecules known to display specific properties, while biochemists investigate the pathways and mechanisms through which these properties are achieved.",
