  "output": "Three advantages of using a neural network over a conventional algorithm are: \n1. Accuracy - Neural networks can make complex decisions that conventional algorithms cannot. \n2. Adaptability - Neural networks can adapt to changing conditions and data more rapidly than conventional algorithms. \n3. Speed - Neural networks can learn more quickly and efficiently than conventional algorithms.",
