  "output": "Once upon a time, a little girl dreamed of traveling to the moon. But no matter how much she wished, she could never find a way to make her dreams come true. One night, however, a magical pencil dropped from the sky and landed in her lap. She grabbed the pencil and began to draw the most incredible and wonderful picture she could imagine - a rocket soaring through the sky, straight up to the moon. As soon as she added the finishing touches to her masterpiece, clouds rolled in and the pencil started to glow. Suddenly, the drawing floated off the paper, twinkled and grew into a real rocket. Excitedly, the little girl jumped in and blasted off to explore the moon. And that's the story of how a pencil and the moon changed a little girl's dreams forever.",
