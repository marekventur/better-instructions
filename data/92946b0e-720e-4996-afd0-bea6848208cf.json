  "input": "",
  "output": "One medical scenario that can potentially lead to a patient's death is sepsis. Sepsis is a serious and often life-threatening reaction to an infection. In sepsis, the heart rate and breathing rate become abnormally high, and blood pressure drops significantly. If left untreated, sepsis can damage vital organs such as the lungs, kidneys, and brain and can ultimately lead to death.",
