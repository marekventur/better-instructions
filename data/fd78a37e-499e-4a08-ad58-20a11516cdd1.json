  "output": "The environmental impact of plastic bags is significant. Plastic bags are a type of single-use plastic and are not biodegradable, meaning that when they are discarded, they do not break down or decompose. They are a significant component of plastic pollution, and can be found clogging waterways, polluting oceans, and contributing to landfills. In addition, plastic bags can also be a source of chemical pollution, as many contain substances that can leach into the environment.",
