  "input": "The Lion King",
  "output": "The story of The Lion King is reminiscent of ancient tales where a young prince is sent away from his kingdom to prevent disaster. In this case, young Simba is tragically orphaned and flees his kingdom in grief. Simba meets new friends and learns valuable lessons as he matures, eventually returning home to restore peace and prosperity to the land his father once ruled. It is a coming-of-age journey of discovery and self-discovery, ultimately teaching that true power lies within oneself and never gives up on hope.",
