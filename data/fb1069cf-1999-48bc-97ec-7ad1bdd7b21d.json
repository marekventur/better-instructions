  "input": "",
  "output": "Obesity has become a global health issue due to a combination of environmental, lifestyle, and dietary factors. Environmental factors, such as urban sprawl and the availability of inexpensive, calorie-dense food, mean that people have fewer opportunities to engage in physical activity. Meanwhile, lifestyle factors, such as long working hours and sedentary entertainment, mean that people are less active than ever before. Finally, dietary habits have shifted towards high-calorie processed food and away from healthy, home-cooked meals. Collectively, these factors have created an environment in which people are more likely to gain weight.",
