  "instruction": "Compare and contrast realism and idealism in philosophy.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Realism and idealism are two different philosophical perspectives that focus on different aspects of reality. Realism is a philosophy that focuses on what is true in the world and asserts that reality exists independently of perception or thought. It states that reality is knowable and contains that which is necessary to exist. On the other hand, idealism is a philosophical perspective that asserts that reality is mental or spiritual in nature and that the physical world is a product of the mind. In other words, reality is based on ideas and ideals that are not necessarily observable in the physical world. Idealism is based on the concept that the universe is made up of thoughts or ideas, while realism argues that the physical world is the only one that exists and is knowable through experience and observation.",
