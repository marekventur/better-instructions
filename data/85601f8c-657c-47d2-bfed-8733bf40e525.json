  "input": "",
  "output": "An AI algorithm for predicting stock prices can be designed using supervised machine learning techniques. This algorithm could be a deep neural network, using historical data and technical analysis indicators as inputs, in order to accurately predict future price movements. The neural network architecture should be designed to recognize patterns in the data, and to forecast future prices accurately through training. Regularization techniques should be employed to ensure the model is robust and does not overfit on the training data. Additionally, the algorithm should be tested for accuracy, using metrics such as the mean absolute error or mean squared error.",
