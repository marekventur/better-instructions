  "input": "",
  "output": "Households can reduce their daily water use by implementing certain strategies. One tactic is to install water-saving fixtures, such as low-flow showerheads and efficient faucet aerators. Additionally, households can take shorter showers and run their washing machines and dishwashers less often or with full loads to conserve water. When washing dishes by hand, households can also conserve water by not running the faucet while they are washing. Finally, households can avoid flushing unnecessarily and collect greywater for reuse.",
