  "input": "",
  "output": "If the Earth's temperature rises, we can expect to see more extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, and storms. Rising sea levels may lead to increased coastal flooding and erosion. An increase in air temperature may result in an increase in atmospheric moisture, leading to more intense precipitation events. It could also lead to an increase in regional species extinctions, as species unable to adapt to the changing climate would be unable to survive.",
