  "input": "",
  "output": "Fermenting beer is the process of transforming sugary, malt-based liquids into an alcoholic beverage. During this process, yeast is added to the liquid and feeds on the sugars, producing carbon dioxide and ethanol. This process can take several weeks, and the taste and strength of the beer can vary based on the length of fermentation, the temperature and additional ingredients. Once fermentation is complete, the beer can be bottled and enjoyed.",
