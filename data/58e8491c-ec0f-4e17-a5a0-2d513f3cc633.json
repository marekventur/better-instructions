  "input": "",
  "output": "In most criminal cases, a judge can grant release on bail if they determine that the accused individual is not a flight risk or a danger to the community. Generally, an individual who is deemed a low risk will be allowed to remain free until their trial while they await their court dates. In some instances, prosecutors may require the accused person to pay a deposit or sign a bail bond in order to remain free. This requires the accused person to promise that they will appear in court or forfeit the money or property that was used for their bail.",
