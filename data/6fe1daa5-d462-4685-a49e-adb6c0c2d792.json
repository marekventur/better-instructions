  "output": "The day starts with a loud ringing bell\nThat calls the children like cattle to school\nThey gather their books and head to the class\nTo endure a day of studying and tests\n\nThe hours can be long and the work hard to face\nWith teachers demanding an ideal pace\nThe students must stay up late and study\nTo keep up with the pressure to be kind of witty\n\nThough everyone strives for the best of their class\nIt's fair to say being a student isn't a piece of cake\nLong hours of study and hard tasks to face\nIt's no lie, there are struggles to being a student these days.",
