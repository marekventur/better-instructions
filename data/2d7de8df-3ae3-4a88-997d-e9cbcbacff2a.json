  "output": "An example of how television ads have helped Mitt Romney's campaign is that he was able to introduce himself to Republican voters as a social and fiscal conservative through his commercials. This jumpstarted his momentum in the early primary states, as evidenced by an American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans, in which Romney's support increased 17 percentage points in the month after airing his commercials.",
