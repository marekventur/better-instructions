  "input": "",
  "output": "Photosynthesis and respiration are closely linked processes in plants. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose, which is then used for growth and reproduction. Respiration is the process by which plants use oxygen to convert the glucose produced by photosynthesis into energy. Both photosynthesis and respiration are necessary for the survival of plants and both processes contribute to the plant\u2019s energy balance. Photosynthesis is the primary source of energy production in plants, while respiration is the primary source of energy consumption. In summary, photosynthesis and respiration are closely connected processes that are key to the survival of plants.",
