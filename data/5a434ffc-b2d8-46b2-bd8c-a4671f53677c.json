  "output": "The Law of Supply and Demand states that the price of a product is determined by the amount of supply and the amount of demand for it. For example, if the demand for a certain type of product increases, the price of that product will increase because the demand is greater than the supply. Conversely, if the supply of the product increases and the demand decreases, then the price of the product will decrease.",
