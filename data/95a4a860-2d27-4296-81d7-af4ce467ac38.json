  "instruction": "How would you describe the process of creating a simple artificial neural network?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Creating a simple neural network involves several steps. First, the inputs and outputs of the network need to be determined. Then, the architecture of the network needs to be designed - this involves determining the number of layers, the number of nodes per layer, and the type of activation functions to be used. Next, the network must be trained on a suitable dataset in order to optimize the weights of the network. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as gradient descent or backpropagation. Finally, the network can be tested on unseen data in order to measure its accuracy.",
