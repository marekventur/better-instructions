  "input": "",
  "output": "A false assumption is the idea that all people are motivated by money. This is not true, as some people are motivated by creating meaningful work or helping others. Other people may be motivated by creating something that lasts and makes a difference beyond just financial gain. People are motivated by different things, so assuming that everyone is only motivated by money is a false assumption.",
