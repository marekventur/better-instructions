  "input": "The ethical issue of facial recognition technology being used to target individuals for inappropriate behavior.",
  "output": "A possible solution for this ethical issue is to create a system of regulations governing when and how facial recognition technology can be used by government agencies, businesses, and other organizations. This system of regulations should also include strict data and privacy protection measures, such as limits on the personal information that can be collected and stored, and how that data can be used. Additionally, if facial recognition technology is used to target individuals for inappropriate behavior, there should be a process in place for individuals to contest the decision and have it reviewed by an independent body.",
