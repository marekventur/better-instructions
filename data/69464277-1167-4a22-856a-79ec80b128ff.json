  "output": "The internet is an amazing tool which has revolutionized our lives, but it also has negative effects. On the one hand, it has made the world a much smaller place with its ability to connect people from any corner of the globe. It has revolutionized the way we access and share information, giving us access to an incredible amount of knowledge. Additionally, it has enabled us to stay in contact with loved ones near and far. On the other hand, the internet also comes with a significant amount of risks. It has exposed us to cybercrime, viruses and other threats. It has also led to increased surveillance and a decrease in privacy. Furthermore, it can easily be a source of distraction, taking away precious time from important tasks. These are some of the pros and cons of the internet that we must consider.",
