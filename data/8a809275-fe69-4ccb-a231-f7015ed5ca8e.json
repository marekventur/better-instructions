  "input": "",
  "output": "Create a series of short videos where a different person stands in a busy public place, like a city plaza or a gathering spot, and says why they turn to the app to relax. This person could quote from the app itself and describe how it helps them find momentary peace, or talk about how sometimes there is no other way to take a break from the day's stress.\n\nTo make sure the app is seen and used, offer free trial services for people who follow the page or share the app with their friends. Additionally, ask local businesses, yoga studios or other relaxation outlets to do a trial with their customers and offer incentives, such as discounts or complimentary services, to those who use the app.\n\nFinally, create an Ambassador Program that supports users who post pictures and write reviews on the app's social media pages.",
