  "input": "",
  "output": "Two methods to improve computer security are: \n1. Increase user authentication by incorporating two-factor authentication with passwords and security questions.\n2. Develop better software and hardware encryption methods to protect sensitive data. Encrypting programs and data is an effective way to protect data from unauthorized access.\n3. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to connect securely to public networks. This will help to protect online data transmitted through public networks. \n4. Use an updated antivirus/anti-malware software to detect and remove any malicious software from the system.\n5. Ensure regular system updates and patching to avoid any malicious attacks from existing or newly discovered vulnerabilities. \n6. Implement robust firewalls and use strong access control measures to restrict remote access.\n7. Regularly backup your data to ensure that in case of any cyber attack or data loss, you can easily restore the data.",
