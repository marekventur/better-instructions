  "output": "The timeline for the events of World War II begins in 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland. In 1940, Germany expands its reach to Norway and Denmark, and in 1941 Germany invades the Soviet Union, leading to the United States joining in the fight. In 1942, Japan launches an attack on Pearl Harbor and also invades the Pacific islands and Southeast Asia. 1943 brings Italy's surrender and the beginning of military operations against Japan in the Pacific. 1944 sees victories against the Axis powers in Europe, culminating with the Allies storming the beaches of Normandy in June. 1945 brings the end of the war, with Germany surrendering in May and the United States dropping atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.",
