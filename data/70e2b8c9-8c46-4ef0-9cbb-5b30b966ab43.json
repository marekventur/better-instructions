  "output": "A frosty winter night, \nThe sky glimmers with snow and ice.\nThe trees stand tall and chill,\nWrapped in an ethereal white crystal sill. \nThe cool air creates a mist,\nBlowing through gentle winds kissed. \nThe moon's reflection a sight to see,\nAs the stars twinkle above and below the deep sea. \nIt's time to tuck away tight,\nFor tonight there's a magical winter night.",
