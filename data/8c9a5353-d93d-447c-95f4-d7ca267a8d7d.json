  "input": "",
  "output": "Using a ladder in the workplace can provide a number of benefits. First and foremost, it can help to reduce the risk of injury by providing a stable platform to reach otherwise hard-to-reach areas. It can also help to save time as workers can move quickly between areas of the workplace that would otherwise require climbing or finding an alternate way to access. Finally, it can also help reduce the amount of stress on other areas of the body by ensuring that the worker is properly balanced and does not have to strain themselves to reach heights.",
