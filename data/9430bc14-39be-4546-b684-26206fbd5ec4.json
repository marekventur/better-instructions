  "input": "",
  "output": "Three common validation techniques used in Machine Learning are K-Fold Cross Validation, Leave One Out Cross Validation, and Hold Out Validation. K-Fold Cross Validation is a technique where data is divided into subsets of training and test data. Leave One Out Cross Validation is a type of resampling technique where a single data sample is used for testing and the remaining samples are used for training. Hold Out Validation is a technique where a fixed percentage of the data is used for testing, while the remaining data is used for training.",
