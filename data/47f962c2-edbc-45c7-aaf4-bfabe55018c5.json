  "output": "In order to encourage students to interact more in a virtual classroom setting, it is important to create an inviting and comfortable atmosphere. The instructor can start by addressing each student by name, and make sure that everyone is given an equal opportunity to participate. It is also beneficial to pose open-ended questions to the class that require students to think critically and express their opinions. Furthermore, the instructor should provide regular feedback and guidance on their contributions. Lastly, it is important to create fun activities and games that promote collaboration between students and create a positive learning environment.",
