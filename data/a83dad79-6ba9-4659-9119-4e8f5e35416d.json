  "input": "",
  "output": "A car parking system could be designed to facilitate parking for vehicles and minimize congestion in parking lots. The system could track the number of available parking spaces in a given parking lot or garage, allowing cars to easily find open spots. \n\nThe system could also be integrated with a payment system, allowing users to pay for parking remotely. Furthermore, the system could allow users to reserve specific spots that would be pre-adjusted for their vehicle, ensuring that it will fit. This would reduce time spent trying to fit a vehicle in a spot. \n\nIn conclusion, a car parking system could be designed to provide users with an efficient, hassle-free way to find parking spaces and pay for them.",
