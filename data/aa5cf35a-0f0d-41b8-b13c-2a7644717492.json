  "output": "Biological evolution is a process that explains the diversity of life on Earth. It involves the gradual change in inherited traits of species over multiple generations. This is caused by naturally occurring genetic changes, such as mutation and genetic recombination. These changes can result in adaptations that equip species to survive and reproduce in different environments. Over time, these adaptive changes will accumulate in the gene pool and lead to the emergence of new species. Different evolutionary pressures, like competition, predation, and environmental conditions, can result in diverging lineages of species. This is how speciation happens. Finally, the combination of these processes and time contributing to the accumulation of different traits within species creates biodiversity in the world.",
