  "input": "Images of cats (or dog breeds) from different breeds such as Persian, Siamese, Maine Coon, etc.",
  "output": "A rule-based system for identifying cat breeds can be created by analyzing an image's visual features and comparing them to known attributes of cats from different breeds. For example, comparing fur color, pattern, length, muzzle shape, and eye shape, can help identify Persian cats. Similarly, tail length and shape, muzzle shape, and ear shape can help identify a Siamese cat. Maine Coons can be identified through fur color and length, eyes, and presence of a ruff. Other features, such as nose color and tail color can also be used to further identify breeds.",
