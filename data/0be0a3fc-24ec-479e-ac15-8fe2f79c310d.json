  "input": "",
  "output": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are both types of deep learning used for various machine learning tasks such as classification, segmentation, and regression. The main difference between them is the way they process data: CNNs process input data in a spatial manner while RNNs process data in a temporal manner. CNNs are best suited for tasks such as computer vision, while RNNs are best suited for tasks such as natural language processing. Another key difference between CNNs and RNNs is their structure: CNNs have multiple layers of convolutional filters while RNNs have layers of recurrent modules.",
