  "output": "The stages of plant growth include seed germination, seedling establishment and growth, vegetative growth, flowering, reproduction, and fruit and seed production. During seed germination, the seed absorbs water which causes its embryo to start growing. During seedling establishment and growth, the emergence of the first leaves and root systems occurs. During vegetative growth, stems, leaves, and flowers start to appear. During flowering, flowers are produced and pollination occurs. During reproduction, fertilization occurs and new seeds are formed inside the fruits. During fruit and seed production, fruits form and ripen, and mature seeds are ready to be dispersed.",
