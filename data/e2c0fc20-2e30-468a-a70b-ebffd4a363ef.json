  "instruction": "Describe what an event listener is in computer programming.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An event listener is a programming concept that allows a computer program to respond to user input or other events that occur in the system. It works by registering \"listener\" functions which will be called whenever a specific event occurs, such as when a user clicks a button or another program launches a specific process. Event listeners are often implemented using callbacks as they allow a program to wait for an event to occur and then execute an action in response.",
