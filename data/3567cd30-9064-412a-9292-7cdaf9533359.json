  "input": "",
  "output": "Air pressure is a measure of the weight of the atmosphere that surrounds us. High-pressure areas, where the weight of the atmosphere is higher, tend to be characterized by clear skies and warmer temperatures, since air tends to sink in high-pressure areas and bring warm air with it. Low-pressure areas, where the weight of the atmosphere is lower, tend to be characterized by cloudy skies and cooler temperatures, since air tends to rise in low-pressure areas and bring cooler air with it.",
