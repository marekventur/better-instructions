  "input": "The rising rate of crime in Richmond, Virginia",
  "output": "The rising rate of crime in Richmond, Virginia has been a cause for concern. According to estimates, violent crime in the area has risen by 15.3% since 2019 and property crime by 7.1%. Other crime such as gang activity and drug-related offences have also contributed to the surge. \n\nThe underlying causes behind the rising crime rate are largely economic in nature. High poverty levels, the lack of job opportunities and increasing housing costs are some of the factors that can be attributed to the crime increase. Additionally, Richmond has seen an influx of young people from other cities, which has led to a rise in population density and more potential for crime.",
