  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of a situation where communication went wrong was when a team member assumed that the instructions from the team leader did not need to be followed. This caused some unnecessary confusion and delays since the leader's instructions were not followed. Communication is key when it comes to successful teamwork, so it is important to make sure that instructions are clarified as well as followed.",
