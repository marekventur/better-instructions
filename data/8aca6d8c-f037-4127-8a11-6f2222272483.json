  "instruction": "Come up with a creative solution to reduce the amount of plastic waste.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One creative solution to reduce plastic waste is to introduce a \u2018deposit-return\u2019 system for plastic products. In this system, consumers would be incentivized to return plastic bottles, containers and other plastic items to designated recycling centers by giving them a deposit which is refunded when they return the item. This would encourage the reuse of the materials and reduce the amount of plastic waste in the environment.",
