  "instruction": "Discuss how the following excerpt is an example of satire.",
  "input": "Excerpt: I realized that most of our people were too busy ever so concerned with their social media accounts to ever think about volunteering or doing anything of use.",
  "output": "This excerpt is an example of satire in that it is mocking the tendency of people to prioritize the trivial over the important. The narrator is implying that people spend too much time on social media and neglect meaningful activities, playing into the idea that we often get too caught up in ourselves and our own interests. This criticism of modern society is a common theme in satire, and this excerpt serves to draw attention to our shortcomings.",
