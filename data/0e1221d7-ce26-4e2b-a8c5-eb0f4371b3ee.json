  "input": "",
  "output": "Making crepes is a simple but rewarding process. Begin by whisking together flour, eggs, milk, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Once everything is evenly mixed, let the batter stand for about 15 minutes. Heat some butter or oil in a pan over medium heat. Pour a ladleful of the batter into the pan and swirl it around until the pan is evenly coated. Let the crepe cook for 2-3 minutes, then flip and cook the other side. Remove from the heat when golden and continue the process until all of your batter is gone. Serve your crepes with a dusting of sugar and a favorite topping. Enjoy!",
