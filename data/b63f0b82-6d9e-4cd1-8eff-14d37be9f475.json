  "input": "",
  "output": "Verse 1:\nThe beauty of the sunsets, the whispers of the trees,\nThe calming sound of the river, the majestic sight of the seas,\nA melody of nature's music so harmoniously divine,\nA journey of a thousand miles ends with a beautiful sunrise.\n\nVerse 2:\nThe snowflakes in mid-air, the fields of amber grain,\nThe rolling hills of lavender, the strength of pouring rain,\nTo take a step outside to get a taste of life,\nConnecting to the nature, to feel joy and free of strife.",
