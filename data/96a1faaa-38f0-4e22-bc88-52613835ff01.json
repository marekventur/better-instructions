  "input": "",
  "output": "A self-fulfilling prophecy is an expectation that comes true because it causes people to act as if it is true. It can be positive or negative and it occurs when a person\u2019s expectations influence their behavior, which in turn influences the outcome of the situation. For example, if a person believes that they are not capable of success, then they may behave in a way that leads to failure, thereby fulfilling the prophecy that was created by their initial belief.",
