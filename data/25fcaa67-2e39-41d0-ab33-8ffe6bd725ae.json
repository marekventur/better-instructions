  "input": "",
  "output": "A bar chart is a chart that compares values across categories by using bars of different heights. Each bar typically represents the sum or average of all the data in the category it represents. A line chart, on the other hand, is a chart that displays the changes in the value of one or more variables over time, typically on an x-axis. Line charts can be used to show trends in data over time, or to compare multiple sets of data. Whereas bar charts indicate the magnitude of the data being measured, line charts indicate the direction of changes in the data over time.",
