  "output": "Public-key cryptography is an important cryptographic technique used for secure communication, data exchange, and digital signatures. It allows two parties to communicate securely, even if they do not have prior knowledge of one another. This allows two strangers to securely exchange encrypted messages with guaranteed confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. \n\nPublic-key cryptography works by assigning a pair of cryptographic keys (called a public-key and a private-key) to a user. The public-key, as the name implies, is available to the public and can be used to encrypt data. The owner of the keys can then use the private-key to decrypt the data. This ensures that data can only be read by the intended recipient, even if intercepted by a third-party. \n\nThe security of public-key cryptography lies in the difficulty of deriving the private-key from the public-key. The public-key can easily be generated from a mathematical algorithm, while the private-key is derived as the result of an extremely long and complicated mathematical process. This significant difference in time and complexity makes it practically impossible for an attacker to obtain the private-key from the public-key, leaving the data secure.\n\nPublic-key cryptography has become an indispensable security tool for securely exchanging sensitive data. Every day, millions of users rely on public-key cryptography for online banking and secure communication, knowing that their data will remain private.",
