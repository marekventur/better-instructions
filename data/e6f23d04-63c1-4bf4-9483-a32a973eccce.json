  "instruction": "Create a sample output to the following task: Analyze the impact of climate change on water resources in the USA.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change is having a significant impact on water resources in the USA. Warmer temperatures are leading to higher evaporation rates and reducing the amount of snow and ice in the mountains, leading to decreased water availability in rivers and reservoirs. Additionally, changes in precipitation patterns are causing flooding in certain areas and drought in others, resulting in further scarcity of freshwater. Climate change is also causing sea levels to rise, increasing the risk of saltwater contamination of ground water and drinking water. These changes in freshwater availability and quality have the potential to create both short-term and long-term consequences, making it essential to take immediate action to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
