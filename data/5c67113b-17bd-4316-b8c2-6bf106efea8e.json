  "input": "",
  "output": "Data Scientists can use a titanic dataset to gain insights into passenger behavior and risk factors related to death on the voyage. By analyzing the data, they can identify characteristics and trends associated with mortality, such as gender, age, ticket class, and so on. They could also use the data to create predictive models that can accurately estimate the likelihood of death under certain conditions. Additionally, they can use data visualization techniques to better understand patterns within the data.",
