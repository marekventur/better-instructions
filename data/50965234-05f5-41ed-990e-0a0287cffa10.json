  "input": "The study explored the effects of using a web-based learning system for teaching primary school students mathematics.",
  "output": "This study focused on the effects of using Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) on primary school students\u2019 mathematics achievement. The study employed a pre-test post-test control group design with two labeled groups: a treatment group of students using the CAI system and a control group receiving traditional instruction. Results indicated that CAI has a positive effect on students' mathematics achievement, leading to greater mathematics performance compared to traditional instruction. The study therefore confirms that the use of CAI may be beneficial for teaching primary school students mathematics.",
