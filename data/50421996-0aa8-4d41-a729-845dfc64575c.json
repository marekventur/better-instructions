  "input": "",
  "output": "Bacterial transformation is a process in which DNA molecules, usually of a foreign origin, are taken up and incorporated into the bacterial genome. The process starts by creating competence in the bacteria, which is the ability to take up exogenous DNA molecules, by the use of calcium chloride. The bacteria are then exposed to a DNA solution. Once the DNA is taken up, it must be induced to enter the cell by either heat shock or by the use of an induction agent. The DNA is then replicated and integrated into the bacterial genome.",
