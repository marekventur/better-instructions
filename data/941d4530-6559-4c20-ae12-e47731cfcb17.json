  "input": "",
  "output": "Research suggests that the use of social media can have a negative impact on children's mental health. Excessive use of social media has been linked to increased feelings of loneliness and isolation, low self-esteem, heightened anxiety and depression, and difficulty managing stress and forming relationships. Additionally, the use of social media can interfere with children's ability to focus, leading to lower academic performance. It can also increase the risk of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and other risky behaviors.",
