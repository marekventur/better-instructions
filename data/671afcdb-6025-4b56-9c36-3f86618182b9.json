  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a walrus living in the tundra of the Arctic Circle. His name was Walter and he was known by all the other animals in the area. He had a number of friends, but nothing could compare to his love for the vast expanse of the tundra.\n\nHe spent his days lazing about on the snow or swimming in the icy waters. He loved to explore the coastline, searching for tasty shellfish to eat on the shore. Every now and then he'd run into a fellow walrus were he would serenade the group with his heart-melting howl.\n\nWalter was content with his lonely life in the tundra, until one day he heard the distant call of another walrus. From then on, he was never alone. He'd swim and explore together with his newfound friend, and he knew that life couldn't get any better.",
