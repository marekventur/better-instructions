  "output": "Down by the river, a new day dawns\nThe sound of the birds is a cheerful song\nThe sunlight is warm on my face\nA gentle smile is seen in its place\n\nThe river speaks of hope and of love\nA peaceful feeling that comes seeping from above\nThe beauty of nature is here for us to share\nThe feeling of joy is everywhere\n\nEach moment of life here I savor and savor\nMy heart is full as I watch the river flow by\nAs I stand upon this shore, smiling until I'm sore\nThis precious place I want to never leave with its sweet serenity.",
