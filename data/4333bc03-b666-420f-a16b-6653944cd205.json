A rabbit hopped across a meadow carpeted with a thick blanket of emerald grass and surrounding trees swaying in unison, their leaves a kaleidoscope of red, yellow, and orange. The horizon dazzled with the last light of day, before the moon took its place in the night sky. In the distance, a faint hoot of an owl calling out in the darkness.",
