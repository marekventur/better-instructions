  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to reduce traffic congestion is by increasing public transportation options such as buses and subways, as well as encouraging telecommuting and carpooling. There are also traffic-management strategies such as traffic calming and intelligent traffic system that can reduce congestion. Additionally, cities should incentivize smart growth with policies that focus on providing greater housing and job opportunities in areas near public transportation networks.",
