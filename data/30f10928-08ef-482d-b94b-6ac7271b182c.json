  "input": "Net neutrality",
  "output": "Net Neutrality refers to the principle that internet service providers should treat all data and traffic on the internet equally. This means that providers should not block or throttle user's access to certain websites and services, or favor some websites over others. Net neutrality ensures that users can access the content they want without interference from ISPs. It is important because it ensures a fair and open internet and prevents ISPs from using their power to unfairly favor some companies over others.",
