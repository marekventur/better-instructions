  "output": "Michael and Anna had been best friends since middle school and this summer, they decided to plan an exciting vacation together. \n\nThey packed their bags and headed to the beach, where they spend the day swimming in the ocean, building sandcastles and basking in the sun.\n\nIn the evenings they took hikes, exploring the local area and admiring the wildlife. During one of their hikes they stumbled upon an abandoned cabin deep in the woods, so they decided to explore it. Sure enough, the cabin was filled with all kinds of interesting, forgotten trinkets \u2013 maps, a music box and a journal filled with secrets.\n\nAs the summer days passed, Michael and Anna continued their exploration of the area, uncovering secrets and solving puzzles, until their summer came to an end. They had the best summer of their lives, and even though they didn't find the lost treasure they were looking for, they left with a trove of stories and memories.",
