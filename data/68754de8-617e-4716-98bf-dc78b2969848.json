  "input": "",
  "output": "Composting is the process of breaking down organic materials into nutrient-rich soil. The process involves mixing equal parts of green materials \u2013 such as grass clippings, vegetable scraps, and coffee grounds \u2013 with brown materials \u2013 such as leaves and straw \u2013 and moistening the mixture with water. The mixture is then aerated to increase the oxygen supply and covered with a layer of soil or straw to help hold in heat and moisture. Microorganisms break down the organic matter in the mixture, and a nutrient-rich soil is formed over a period of weeks or months.",
