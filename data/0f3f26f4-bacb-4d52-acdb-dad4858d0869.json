But no matter how many times she used her magical powers, she still couldn\u2019t shake off her worries. She was always cautious about using her powers for fear of what would happen if someone found out about them. One day, she decided to take the plunge and cast a spell to get rid of her worries. Miraculously, it worked, and she was finally able to enjoy her life without worrying.",
