  "input": "",
  "output": "Different materials will expand or contract at different rates when exposed to cold temperatures. Some materials, such as metals, tend to contract, while other materials, such as plastics, expand. Even materials of the same mass can behave differently depending on their molecular structure when exposed to cold temperatures.",
