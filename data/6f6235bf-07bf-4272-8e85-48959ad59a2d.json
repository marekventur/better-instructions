  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the most effective ways to promote knowledge sharing in society is through education. Having access to good schooling and resources enables people to further develop their skills and understandings. Access to information technology also helps with spreading knowledge. Additionally, organizations and companies can set up mentorship programs, enabling experienced people to share their knowledge with newcomers. This happens often in workshops or online resources. Finally, societies can advocate for more interdisciplinary ways of thinking, which helps to create an environment that is more open to knowledge exchange.",
