  "output": "Five popular fashion trends in 2020 were oversized silhouettes, vintage-style pieces, bright and bold colors, sustainable fashion, and athleisure wear. Oversized silhouettes featured relaxed, free-flowing shapes for a comfortable and effortless look. Vintage-style pieces included classic patterns and plenty of denim. Bold, bright and beautiful colors were also seen on runways, from shocking pinks and neons to softer shades of beige and pastel hues. Sustainable fashion was also a growing trend in 2020, with brands embracing sustainable materials and focused on reducing waste. Finally, athleisure wear continued to be popular, with comfortable, stylish pieces that could be worn both at home and in public.",
