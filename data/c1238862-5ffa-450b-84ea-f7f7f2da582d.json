  "output": "A book cover of 'The Cat in the Hat' could feature a cartoon image of the Cat in the Hat himself wearing a tall red and white striped hat and smiling. A bright and colourful background with stars, balloons and a spaceship could be used to emphasize the cheerful and playful tone of the book. The title of the book should be large and prominent in the centre.",
