  "input": "",
  "output": "The best way to construct a performance review is to assess the individual's performance in the areas most applicable to their job role. These areas should be linked to company objectives, so that there is a consistent need to evaluate and track progress against relevant goals. The review should also include feedback from the individual's peers and other relevant stakeholders, to paint a well-rounded picture of the employee's performance. The review should include an opportunity for the individual to reflect on feedback and identify areas of improvement, as well as strategies to help achieve these.",
