  "output": "Cats and dogs are both mammals. Both are very popular pets, but they have several different qualities. Cats are typically smaller and more independent than dogs. Cats tend to have shorter attention spans and can be trained less easily than dogs, which have a greater capacity for learning and interacting with their owners. However, both animals show loyalty and affection and make excellent companions.",
