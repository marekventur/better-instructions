  "output": "Once upon a time, in a swampy river far away, lived a happy-go-lucky croc by the name of Crocky. He was always full of joy and had a wide smile on his face. He loved swimming in the swamps, basking in the sun, and napping on the riverbank. But, Crocky's biggest pleasure was visiting with his friends the birds.\n\nEach day, Crocky would paddle up to his favorite spot by the bird-bath and sit and chat with the birds all afternoon. The birds loved Crocky so much, they often brought him gifts. One day, they brought him a shiny gem, and he was so excited, he nearly lost it when a giant fish nearly gobbled it up! \n\nThe birds laughed and chirped, telling Crocky not to worry, they would find him many more gems. And sure enough, the birds did find Crocky many more gems, and each day, he grew happier and happier with his bird friends. \n\nBut one day, Crocky noticed his bird friends were not around the bird-bath when he arrived. He asked the other animals in the area if they had seen his friends, but no one had. Then one of the frogs in the swamp suggested that Crocky should come to the center of the swamp to find his friends. \n\nCrocky was hesitant, for he had never been to the center of the swamp before. But eventually, he decided to give it a try and paddled off in the direction of the center of the swamp. After a while, he saw a large gathering of birds at the edge of the river, and he knew that his bird friends must be there. \n\nWhen Crocky paddled closer, he saw that the birds were all singing, swaying, and dancing around something in the middle of the river. As he got closer, he saw it was a giant golden egg! He couldn't believe his eyes! \n\nTurns out, the birds had brought Crocky to a special celebration. They were celebrating the hatching of the baby crocodile that was inside the giant golden egg! Crocky was so happy and he thanked the birds for bringing him and his new baby crocodile friend to the celebration. \n\nSince then, Crocky and his baby crocodile friend have enjoyed swimming, playing and basking in the sun together in the swampy river and are always visited by their bird friends.\n\nThe End.",
