What has been happening since we last spoke? \nPatient: I've been feeling a bit more fatigued and I'm having a hard time sleeping at night. \nNurse: That sounds concerning. Are there any other symptoms? \nPatient: Yes, I've also been having headaches and a sore throat. \nNurse: That's definitely not a good sign. Let's get your vitals checked and we'll go from there.",
