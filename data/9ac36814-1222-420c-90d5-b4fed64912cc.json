  "instruction": "What are three potential problems for running a Linux system in a Virtual Machine?",
  "input": "No input",
  "output": "1. Limited resources: running a Linux system in a Virtual Machine can mean fewer resources available than if it was running on a physical machine. \n2. Security vulnerabilities: any vulnerabilities present in the host operating system, such as the Hypervisor, can put the Linux system running in the Virtual Machine at risk. \n3. Device compatibility: running a Linux system in a Virtual Machine may lead to compatibility issues with certain hardware, such as graphics cards.",
