  "output": "As robotics and artificial intelligence technology become increasingly prevalent in modern society, the future of human-robot interactions is an ever-growing area of research. It is already anticipated that robots could one day play a big role in people's lives, from helping in medical fields to supporting the elderly. In order for robots and humans to coexist, it is essential to develop systems that can sensing and understand human emotion. In the future, robots should have the capacity to provide emotional support, such as recognizing and responding to humans' feelings in a socially acceptable manner. This could lead to robots being seen as taking on the roles of companions and family members in our lives.",
