  "output": "The engineering design process is an iterative problem-solving approach used to develop engineered products. It involves defining the problem, devising a solution, constructing a prototype, testing the prototype, and making modifications as needed. This process is repeatedly done until the desired results are achieved. It is an important tool for any engineer as it helps improve products, reduce time-to-market, and reduce costs.",
