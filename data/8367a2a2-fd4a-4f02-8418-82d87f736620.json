  "output": "The space rocket was a shining, white pillar of power and energy, pointing straight up against the black night sky. It was surrounded by a golden glow from the bright flames pouring from each of its engines as it slowly rumbled out of the launch pad and rose into the sky. The ground shook with a thunderous roar as the rocket streaked away, arcing higher and higher as it shot off into space.",
