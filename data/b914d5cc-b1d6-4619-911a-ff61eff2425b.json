  "output": "Bruce Almighty is a deftly crafted comedy starring the incomparable Jim Carrey in the titular role. The film follows Bruce Nolan, a hapless news reporter begrudgingly transferred to The Almighty's news desk. He quickly discovers that life isn't all fun and games when he finds himself playing deity for a day and is comically overwhelmed by the responsibilities bestowed upon him. This incisive tale hilariously wrestles with complicated questions of faith, destiny, and the Almighty's place in the modern world.",
