  "output": "A web server is used to serve content to client computers over the Internet. Its main functions are to accept requests from clients, retrieve the requested content, and send it to the client. A web server can also be used to authenticate clients and provide secure access to parts of a website. An application server, on the other hand, serves applications to clients. It can be used to process requests from client computers, manage databases and components, and coordinate services. It contains custom code that can handle specific services, such as credit card processing, online booking, and more.",
