  "input": "",
  "output": "Machine learning can be used to automate mundane tasks such as document classification, sentiment analysis, predictive analytics, and natural language processing. These tasks can be tedious and time-consuming for humans to do, but machine learning algorithms can perform them quickly and accurately. Machine learning can also be used for more complex tasks such as object recognition and autonomous driving, which require advanced algorithms and large amounts of data. Machine learning makes it possible to automate many tasks that would otherwise have to be done manually, saving time and energy.",
