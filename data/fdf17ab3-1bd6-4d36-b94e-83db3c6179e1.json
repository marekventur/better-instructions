  "input": "",
  "output": "A speech recognition technology could be used in a car to enable hands-free calling. Users could simply say \"call John Doe\", and the car would automatically connect the call. Additionally, voice commands could also be used to access GPS navigation, adjust climate control, and listen to music. Furthermore, it could be used to enable voice assistants like Cortana and Alexa to control devices throughout the home. Finally, it can be used for voice-based biometric authentication for unlocking doors or authorizing payments.",
