  "input": "Strategy: Attract new customers by offering discounts.",
  "output": "Offering discounts may attract new customers in the short term, but it can be unsustainable in the long run. It may be more beneficial to focus on developing relationships with existing customers and investing in strategies that will improve customer loyalty. Additionally, offering incentives such as free trials, special offers, and customer rewards can also be effective in attracting new customers and retaining them in the long run.",
