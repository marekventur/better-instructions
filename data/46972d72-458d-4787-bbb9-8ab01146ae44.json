  "instruction": "Construct a statement to argue why data augmentation techniques should be used for deep learning.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Data augmentation techniques should be used for deep learning to increase the size of datasets and reduce the chances of overfitting. By creating more data with transformations such as image rotation, scaling, and cropping, deep learning models can benefit from larger and more diverse datasets. These augmented data points also help the model to recognize and apply generalizable learning concepts to new inputs, resulting in better performance and increased accuracy.",
