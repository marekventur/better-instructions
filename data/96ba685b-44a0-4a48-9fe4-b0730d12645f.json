  "instruction": "How do electrons in atoms interact with each other?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Electrons in atoms interact with each other through coulombic forces. These forces are a result of the attraction or repulsion between the electrical charges of the electrons. The stronger the electric field between the electrons, the stronger the coulombic force. This force causes the electrons to form bound states, where they share their energies, thus creating a stable atom.",
