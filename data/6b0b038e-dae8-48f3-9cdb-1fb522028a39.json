  "input": "",
  "output": "Common methods for cleaning up text data are string replacement, tokenization, stemming and lemmatization, and regular expressions. String replacement involves replacing certain words or phrases with others, such as abbreviations with full words. Tokenization is the process of breaking a large string of text into individual words, phrases, and symbols. Stemming and lemmatization are techniques used to reduce words to their base form. Finally, regular expressions can be used to identify patterns in text and replace them with desired outputs.",
