  "instruction": "Answer the following question: What are alternate ways to generate electricity other than burning fossil fuels?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "There are several ways to generate electricity without burning fossil fuels. Solar energy is perhaps the most abundant source of renewable energy, as the sun is a consistent and reliable source of energy. Wind turbines can generate energy from the wind, and geothermal energy plants can generate energy from the Earth's internal heat. Other forms of renewable energy include tidal energy from ocean waves and biomass energy from organic matter.",
