  "input": "Reducing plastic pollution",
  "output": "One project that could help reduce plastic pollution is to encourage the use of reusable cups, bags, and storage containers. This could be done through incentives like discounts for customers who bring their own reusable containers or bans on single-use plastic bags. This would reduce the use of plastic, cut down on waste, and promote sustainability.",
