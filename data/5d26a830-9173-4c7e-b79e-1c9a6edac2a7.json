  "instruction": "Use a robotic arm to pick up a specific item and move it to a specific location.",
  "input": "The item is a blue pen. The location is a nearby desk.",
  "output": "Using the robotic arm, the pen is picked up from it\u2019s original location, and moved to the nearby desk. This is accomplished by using sensors to locate the pen, and then using the robotic arm's gripping mechanism to grasp it. Then, the robotic arm is controlled to move to the nearby desk, where it releases the pen.",
