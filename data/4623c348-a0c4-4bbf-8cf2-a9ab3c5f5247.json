  "input": "",
  "output": "The advantages of using a cloud-native architecture include scalability, high availability, cost efficiency, and agility. Cloud-native architecture allows for applications to be built on cloud infrastructure, which makes it easier to scale up and down on demand to meet the changing needs of users. It also provides automatic fault tolerance and high availability, ensuring that applications remain available even in the event of system or network failure. Cloud-native architecture is also more cost-efficient as it enables businesses to take advantage of the cloud\u2019s pay-as-you-go pricing structure. Finally, as cloud-native systems are designed to be flexible and modular, they enable faster development, deployment, and changes to be made quickly and reliably.",
