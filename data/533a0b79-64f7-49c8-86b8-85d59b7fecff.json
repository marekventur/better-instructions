  "output": "Autumn paints the sky in woozy shades of yellow and pink\nColors light up the sky like a scene from the movies I think\nThe leaves dance and sway in the gentlest of winds\nThe birds sing songs of joy one can't even comprehend\nThe sun sparkles in the sky as bright as a star\nIt's beauty is hard to describe yet so oddly bizarre\nThe world of autumn is one meant for blissful relaxation\nIt sounds the call for nature, the resurrection of its passion.",
