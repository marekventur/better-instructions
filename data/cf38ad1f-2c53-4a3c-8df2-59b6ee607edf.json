  "output": "One example of an AI-related ethical dilemma is the use of facial recognition technology. In some instances, the technology is being used to identify potential suspects in criminal activity and can result in false positives or the wrong identification of people. On the other hand, the technology is also being used to help identify missing children or missing persons. Thus, the ethical dilemma is how far should this technology be used and how much potential it has for misuse.",
