  "input": "",
  "output": "The stock market is a marketplace where buyers and sellers trade shares of stock in companies that are listed on a stock exchange. Buyers hope to buy shares at a low price and sell them later at a higher price, while sellers intend to do the opposite and make a profit. The price of the stock is determined by the supply and demand that is being generated on the stock exchange. When more buyers are interested in a stock than sellers and the demand is greater than the supply, the price of the stock increases and vice versa.",
