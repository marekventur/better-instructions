  "instruction": "Generate a musical arrangement that includes melodic lines, chords and accompanying instruments.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The musical arrangement begins with a simple melody on a piano as the primary instrument. A violin joins in as a countermelody as it swirls and dances around the original melody. Following this there is a low driving beat underneath it all, accompanying a deep bass sound of a cello. As the melody builds and gains intensity, other subtle instruments such as guitars and drums enter the mix to give the arrangement a fuller sound. The chorus brings in a high-tempo rhythm with an electric guitar solo and a saxophone solo that carries the main melody to its climax. A drum line comes in at the very end to finish off the song.",
