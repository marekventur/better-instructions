  "output": "The adoption of AI is likely to have both positive and negative impacts on the job market. On one hand, it will create new job opportunities by allowing for the automation of routine or tedious tasks, reducing the amount of human labor needed for certain jobs, and allowing companies to operate more efficiently. On the other hand, it may lead to job displacement, as certain job roles may become obsolete, and automation may limit career advancement and job security.",
