  "input": "",
  "output": "Humans and cats are both warm-blooded mammals, but their physical and behavioral differences are vast. Cats have sharp claws and long, flexible bodies designed for climbing, pouncing, and ambushing prey. Humans, on the other hand, are relatively slow-moving and use tools to help them succeed. Humans use language to express their needs and desires, while cats rely on their body posture, facial expressions, and meows. Additionally, cats need regular grooming, while humans require less maintenance.",
