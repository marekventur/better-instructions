  "instruction": "Evaluate the following statement: \"Schools should be closed during summer vacation.\"",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Closing schools during summer vacation may not be the ideal solution. While this could save money on energy costs, school closures could put extra strain on parents and caregivers who must then find alternative childcare arrangements. On the other hand, keeping schools open throughout the summer would likely require higher taxes to support summer programs and pay for utilities. Both options should be carefully evaluated in order to make an informed decision.",
