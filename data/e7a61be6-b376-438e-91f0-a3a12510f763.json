  "input": "",
  "output": "One way to save energy in a hospital is to implement energy-efficient building materials, such as insulated walls and solar-reflective roofing. In addition, switching to LED lighting and motion-sensor lighting to reduce energy consumption throughout the hospital would be an efficient way to save energy. Finally, installing energy-efficient cooling, heating, and water systems would further contribute to energy savings.",
