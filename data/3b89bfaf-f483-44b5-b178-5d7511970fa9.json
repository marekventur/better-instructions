  "instruction": "Consider the following scenario. What type of ethical framework would you apply to make a decision?",
  "input": "A new medical treatment has been proposed for a terminal disease. The treatment is highly experimental and the success rate is low, but it has the potential to save a large number of lives.",
  "output": "The ethical framework I would apply to this scenario is Utilitarianism. According to this ethical framework, the morality of an action is determined by its consequences, so the decision should be made with a calculation of the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people. As the medical treatment has the potential to save lives, this is a situation where the benefits of taking a risk outweigh the risks of not taking one. Therefore, Utilitarianism would suggest that this medical treatment should be implemented, as it has the potential to yield the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people.",
