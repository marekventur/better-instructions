  "input": "",
  "output": "The user interface for the payment processing website should be simple and user-friendly. It should consist of a main page with navigation buttons that allow users to access different features. At the top of the page, a search bar should be included to allow users to quickly find relevant information. The main page should also include a list of the available payment options, along with descriptions of each option. On the side of the page, there should be a live chat system that allows customers to quickly and easily ask questions and get help from customer service. Finally, a help section should be included at the bottom of the page to provide more detailed explanations and troubleshooting advice.",
