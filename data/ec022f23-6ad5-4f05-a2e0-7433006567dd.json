  "input": "",
  "output": "A typical day for a student studying computer science usually starts quite early in the morning. After grabbing a cup of coffee, the student would sit down at the desk to check their emails and the news for the day, then start working on the many projects that need their attention. Most of the day consists of coding, debugging, and researching programming tools, techniques, and best practices. Depending on the day, the student might either attend online lectures or tutorials, or opt for studying and completing assignments on their own. In the afternoon, the student might socialize with their peers or colleagues by joining online discussions in computer science forums, or networking with industry professionals. At the end of the day, the student would make time to de-stress by playing video games, going for a walk, or just refreshing their mind with a few minutes of meditation.",
