  "output": "The Pythagorean Theorem is widely used outside of the classroom. In architecture, it can be used to ensure the validity of right-angled triangles used in construction and as the basis for calculating distances between points. It is also used in navigation, including the calculation of distances between cities on a map. Finally, it is used in physics to calculate the frequency of sound waves and the speed of objects in motion.",
