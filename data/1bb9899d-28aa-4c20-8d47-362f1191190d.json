  "output": "One famous artwork created by Pablo Picasso is \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\", a painted canvas which he finished in 1907. It is regarded as a seminal work in the development of modern art as it displays Picasso's deliberate departure from traditional painting techniques of line and form. In this painting, Picasso uses various aspects of cubism, an artistic movement developed by Picasso and George Braque, which rearranges form on the canvas and strips the painting of its realism.",
