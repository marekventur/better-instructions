  "output": "An agent is a person or entity that has been appointed to act on behalf of another person or entity. An agent may be a representative for a company, and can be empowered to make decisions and sign documents; agents are typically acting on the instructions of their principal.\n\nAn organization is a group that has been formed for a specific purpose. Organizations may be business-oriented, such as a company, partnership, or corporation, or may be non-profit, such as NGOs. Organizations are typically made up of multiple members, often consisting of more than one agent. Organizations are responsible for making decisions, enacting plans and policies, and carrying out operations.",
