  "instruction": "Design an algorithm for searching for duplicate contact entries in a list of emails.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm should first read each email address to determine if the address is unique or a duplicate of an existing address. To ensure accuracy, the data should be broken down into tokens based on the local-part (before the @) and the domain-part (after the @). Then, these tokens can be compared to other email addresses in the list to identify duplicates. To handle the possibility of typos, a fuzzy matching algorithm can be implemented that accounts for errors in the input. For example, if two entries have matching local-part tokens but different domain-part tokens, a fuzzy matching algorithm can be used to decide whether it should be categorized as a duplicate or a typo. Additionally, a binary search tree could be used to compare the tokenized data and determine faster whether an email address is a duplicate or not.",
