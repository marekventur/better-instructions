  "input": "",
  "output": "The best value for the hyperparameter gamma in Support Vector Machines (SVM) depends on the type of problem and the data used. Generally, it is recommended to start with a low value, typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.001, and then adjust it incrementally according to the results. Tuning the hyperparameter correctly allows SVM models to better detect complex nonlinear relations in the data.",
