  "instruction": "Given two excerpts, compare and contrast the writing style.",
  "input": "Excerpt 1: \n\"The sky was a deep blue, and in the distance, a few white clouds dotted the horizon.\"\n\nExcerpt 2:\n\"He sky seemed swollen and red, a reflection of the anger rising within him.\"",
  "output": "The two excerpts contrast each other in terms of their description of the sky. The first excerpt is written in a more objective and factual way, using phrases such as \"deep blue\" and \"white clouds\". The description also appeals to the senses, providing a vivid picture of the sky. \n\nMeanwhile, the second excerpt takes a more subjective and emotional approach, describing the sky as \"swollen and red\" and reflecting the character's anger. This description is more abstract and focuses more on the feelings the sky conveys rather than the physical characteristics. \n\nOverall, the two excerpts differ in terms of their writing style, with the first being more objective and factual, and the second being more subjective and emotional.",
