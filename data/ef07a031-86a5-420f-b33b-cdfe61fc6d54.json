  "instruction": "You are working on a website. Design a user experience flow for users who want to search for a particular product.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The user experience for searching for a particular product should begin with providing users with relevant categories to browse, such as \u201capparel\u201d, \u201celectronics\u201d, or \u201ckitchenware\u201d. From there, users can be presented with subcategories if necessary. Once the user reaches the target product category, they can be met with different filters, such as color, size, price range, and style, to further narrow down their search. After selecting these filters, the user should then be presented with the products. If they are unable to find what they are looking for, they should be presented with an option to refine their search, or to contact customer service for assistance.",
