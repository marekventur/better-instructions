  "instruction": "Develop an algorithm for detecting spam messages.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An algorithm for spam message detection should include features such as keywords, character patterns, sender email domain, and IP address. In addition to these, it should also include language modeling to identify suspicious phrases and certain words that are commonly associated with spam messages. The algorithm should also incorporate machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, and decision trees in order to better detect subtle differences between legitimate and spam messages.",
