  "input": "",
  "output": "The logo for the vegan cooking class should be modern and inviting. The colors used should be vibrant and eye-catching, such as green and yellow, as these colors are associated with freshness and health. The logo should also feature a graphic or icon of a leaf that ties in with the concept of veganism. The text used for the logo should be bold and modern, and it should include the name of the class. Finally, the logo should be easily recognizable for marketing or branding purposes, so it should be made with a consistent design across multiple platforms.",
