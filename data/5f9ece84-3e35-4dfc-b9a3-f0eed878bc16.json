  "input": "",
  "output": "The Moon's gravitational pull is one of the primary causes of tides on Earth. The Moon's gravitational force is strongest on the side facing the Moon and weakest on the opposite side. This difference in gravity creates two bulges, one called the high tide and the other called the low tide. As the moon orbits around the Earth, the two bulges move with it, with the ocean's liquid rising and falling giving us the two daily high and low tides.",
