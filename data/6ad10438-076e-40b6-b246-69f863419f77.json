  "input": "",
  "output": "If the Earth's rotation were to suddenly stop, the Earth's atmosphere would gradually drift away into space due to its lack of an effective gravitational pull. As a result, the planet's surface temperature would rise drastically, and most living organisms would likely be unable to survive the extreme temperature changes. In addition, without the Coriolis force, the familiar patterns of ocean currents would also be drastically altered.",
