  "output": "A computer virus is a type of malicious software designed to alter or damage a computer system without any user input. Computer viruses can cause a variety of effects, depending on their type. Malware viruses can corrupt data and files, spyware can eavesdrop on user activity, and ransomware can completely lock a user out of their data until a pay-off is made. Some viruses can even use a computer's resources to run their own programs. In short, computer viruses are a massive threat to digital safety and can cause costly damage if not addressed quickly.",
