  "input": "",
  "output": "A nuclear reactor is a device used to generate electricity using nuclear energy. It works by using uranium as fuel to create a chain reaction, which releases energy in the form of heat. This heat is used to boil water and create steam, which turns a turbine generator that produces electricity. Nuclear reactors are used in power plants to create electricity.",
