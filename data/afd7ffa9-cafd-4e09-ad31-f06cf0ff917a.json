  "input": "",
  "output": "The paper \"A Social Network that Influences Attitudes and Behaviors\" discusses how online social networks can influence people\u2019s attitudes and behaviors. It suggests that online networks are capable of reaching more people than in-person networks, and that this can result in drastic alteration of attitudes and behaviors on a wider scale. The paper argues that certain individuals within networks can serve as influentials, having an outsize impact on opinions and behaviors of those around them, which has implications for how society functions. The paper further suggests that the study of online networks is a crucial area of research to better understand and predict social change.",
