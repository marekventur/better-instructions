  "instruction": "Describe how the technology could be used to help the environment.",
  "input": "The technology is called Aquaseabotics, which is a system of underwater robots used for ocean exploration and observation.",
  "output": "Aquaseabotics can be used to help the environment by providing an alternative method for researching and monitoring the ocean. The robots can be outfitted with cameras, sensors, and sampling devices that collect data about ocean temperature, salinity, and acidity, which can be used to track the effects of climate change. They can also detect and map ocean pollutants like garbage and pollutants that may have been spilled by vessels.",
