  "input": "",
  "output": "The Principle of Superposition states that in an undisturbed sequential deposit of sedimentary rocks, the oldest layers of rock are found at the bottom, while the youngest are found at the top. This principle forms the basis for geological dating, allowing geologists to estimate the relative age of different layers of rock in a sequence. It holds true for sedimentary rocks and even for older crystalline rocks, when multiple layers of crystal are added to the existing sequence. In addition, the Principle of Superposition can also be used to determine the original sequence of events in a given area.",
