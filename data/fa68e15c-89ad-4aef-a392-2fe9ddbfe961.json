  "output": "The mathematical concept of probability is used to describe the likelihood that a certain event will occur. It is typically expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage and can range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the event has no probability of occurring, and 1 indicates that the event has a 100% chance of occurring. Probability can help to inform decisions by providing information on how likely an event is to occur, given the known parameters.",
