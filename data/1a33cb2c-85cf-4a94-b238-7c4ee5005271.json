  "input": "",
  "output": "The best way to train a cat to use the litter box is to start with a clean litter box in a quiet, private area. Place your cat in the litter box, praising and rewarding it if it uses it. If the cat doesn't use the litter box, encourage it by using scented litter and cleaning the box regularly to keep it fresh. You can also provide positive reinforcement such as treats and extra playtime when your cat uses the box properly. Finally, make sure the box isn't too dirty and has enough space for your cat to turn around and cover its waste.",
