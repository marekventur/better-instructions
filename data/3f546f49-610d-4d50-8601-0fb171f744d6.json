  "input": "<no input>",
  "output": "Machine Learning is a field of Artificial Intelligence that involves developing algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on a set of parameters. The algorithms used in Machine Learning are adaptive and constantly evolving and thus, can be used to effectively map complex problems and processes. Machine Learning algorithms are used for a variety of tasks, such as classification, pattern recognition, clustering, regression, and anomaly detection.",
