  "output": "The most efficient way to test a model built by a GPT language model is to use automated Natural Language Testing (NLT). NLT is an efficient method for testing a language model's ability to generate valid text with different properties and distributions, while also testing its robustness against perturbation. NLT also scores a language model based on the features that determine its quality, such as ability to generate coherent and valid text, ability to generate sentences with correct syntax, and ability to capture the overall meaning of a given sentence.",
