  "input": "",
  "output": "In quantum mechanics, the wave nature of matter is explained by wave-particle duality, which states that objects can exhibit wave-like behavior and also behave as particles. This duality is due to the wavefunction, which describes the probability of a particle being at a given location in space. The wavefunction's behavior suggests that a particle can have an infinite number of possible states, and its wave-like nature allows it to spread out over a larger area and interfere with other nearby particles. As a result, the probability of a particle being in a certain region can be affected by the behavior of other particles in that region.",
