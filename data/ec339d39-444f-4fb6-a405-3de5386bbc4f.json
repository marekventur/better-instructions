  "input": "",
  "output": "Deep learning is a form of artificial intelligence because it is inspired by the functionality of the human brain. Deep learning architectures, such as neural networks and convolutional networks, are used to identify patterns and relationships in data. By using multiple layers, deep learning is able to detect complex non-linear patterns and make decisions based on those patterns. Deep learning algorithms have the capability to learn and adapt over time, similar to human intelligence.",
