  "input": "",
  "output": "A data scientist and a data analyst have different functions and roles. A data analyst typically focuses on data collection, cleaning, and interpretation, while a data scientist may analyze more complex data and provide insights from it. A data scientist may also use machine learning and deep learning to gain understanding from datasets while a data analyst focuses more on exploratory analysis. Data scientists often work in interdisciplinary teams and use predictive modelling, while data analysts may examine existing datasets to gain insights. Additionally, a data analyst may use statistical models and machine learning algorithms, while a data scientist will typically use more advanced methods such as deep learning or artificial intelligence.",
