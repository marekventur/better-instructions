  "instruction": "Evaluate the argument \"We should not raise taxes on the wealthy\".",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The argument that we should not raise taxes on the wealthy is flawed, as doing so could help close the income gap between the wealthy and the poor. Higher taxes on the wealthy would also increase the amount of money available to fund services and programs that benefit everyone, such as public schools and healthcare. This can lead to greater equality and better prospects for all. Additionally, the burden of taxation should not be disproportionately placed on lower earners, who are likely to have a smaller capacity to pay than the wealthy. In sum, raising taxes on the wealthy could provide equitable outcomes for all.",
