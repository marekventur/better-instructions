The animal, discovered by a research team from the University of California, Berkeley, is a mammal and is estimated to be around two feet long. It is so far unnamed and is described as having an orange coat with white rings on its tail and legs. It also has a long snout and appears to be a carnivore. \n\nThe research team observed the animal in its natural habitat and collected samples for further study. This marks a huge breakthrough for conservationists, as the discovery of this new species opens up the potential for further research into the diversity of species living in the forest.",
