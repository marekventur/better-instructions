  "input": "Problem: Littering in public spaces.",
  "output": "To combat the problem of littering in public spaces, I propose a three-pronged approach. First, we can enact strict penalties on those who are caught littering. This will act as a deterrent, as those who are caught littering will have to face the consequences. Second, we can create more public awareness campaigns to educate people about the dangers of littering and the importance of keeping our public spaces clean. This will help people to take more responsibility for their actions and be more mindful of the environment. Finally, we can install more garbage cans and recycling bins in public spaces to make it easier for people to properly dispose of their waste. By taking these steps, we can ensure that our public spaces remain clean and litter-free.",
