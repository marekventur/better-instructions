  "input": "",
  "output": "When evaluating a model for detecting fraudulent financial transactions, it\u2019s important to measure metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and the false positive rate (FPR). Accuracy measures the overall performance of the model, while recall and precision measure how effective the model is at identifying true positives and true negatives. F1 score measures the balance between precision and recall, and FPR measures the percentage of false positives relative to true positives.",
