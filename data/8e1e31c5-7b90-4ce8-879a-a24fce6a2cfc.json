  "input": "No input.",
  "output": "Biodiversity is beneficial to the environment because it helps to maintain a natural balance of life and ecosystems. Biodiversity helps to support numerous ecological processes such as carbon cycling, nutrient recycling and pollination, which can help to maintain the stability of an ecosystem, reduce climate change and provide habitat for animals and resources for humans. Furthermore, it increases the resilience of an ecosystem- meaning it can recover better from natural disasters or economic hardship.",
