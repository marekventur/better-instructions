  "input": "https://www.vox.com/2015/7/16/8962643/Gender-neutral-pronouns",
  "output": "Gender-neutral pronouns are terms that don\u2019t specify male or female, like \"they\", \"ze\" or \"ey\". This idea has been around for decades as an effort to create an inclusive language that doesn\u2019t exclude anyone, however recently it has grown in popularity. Gender-neutral pronouns are becoming more widely accepted and used in the community, and they are a tool to promote understanding and respect while addressing someone.",
