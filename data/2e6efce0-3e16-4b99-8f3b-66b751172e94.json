  "output": "Good morning everyone,\n\nToday I'd like to talk about the importance of renewable energy in a sustainable future. We know that the world faces a number of environmental challenges, from air and water pollution to climate change. And in order to address these issues, we need to move away from our dependence on fossil fuels and start embracing renewable energy sources. Renewable energy can be generated from natural resources like sunlight, wind, and water, which are much better for the environment than burning fossil fuels. Furthermore, renewable energy sources are often less expensive and more reliable than traditional energy sources.\n\nIn the long run, using renewable energy sources can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create a more secure, sustainable future. So let's all do our part to switch to renewable energy and help create a healthier, more sustainable world. Thank you.",
