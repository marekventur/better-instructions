  "input": "",
  "output": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computing system inspired by the human brain. It is composed of interconnected neurons which exchange information to solve problems. Much like the human brain, ANNs use neurons to store and process information, as well as make connections between neurons to create a network of neurons. ANNs are also capable of learning and adapting to changes in their environment, allowing them to modify their behavior and improve their performance. While the exact workings of the human brain are still largely unknown, ANNs provide us with a powerful tool to explore its complex architecture and gain a better understanding of how it works.",
