  "instruction": "Explain the differences between centripetal and centrifugal forces",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Centripetal force is a force that acts on an object directed toward the center of a circle, while centrifugal force is a force that acts on an object directed away from the center of a circle. The centripetal force is responsible for keeping an object moving in a circular motion while the centrifugal force creates an outward pull that tries to break away from the circular path. In short, centripetal forces act to draw objects inward, while centrifugal forces act to push them away.",
