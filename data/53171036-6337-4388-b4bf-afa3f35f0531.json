  "input": "",
  "output": "Amazon employs a complex and efficient shipping system to get products to its customers quickly and safely. When an order is placed, Amazon's warehouse workers locate the item and package it. Then, the order is shipped to one of Amazon's fulfillment centers, where it is sorted and entered into the Amazon logistics system. The order is then transported via truck, rail, or airplane to its delivery destination, and delivered to the customer.",
