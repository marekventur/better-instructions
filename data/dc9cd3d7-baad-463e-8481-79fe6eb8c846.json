  "output": "Painting a room involves several steps. First, it is important to clean the walls and prepare them for painting, either by washing them or removing and patching any loose paint or wallpaper. Next, the wall should be sanded to ensure a smooth surface. After that, it is necessary to apply a primer - a coat of paint that acts as a sealant - and let it dry completely. Finally, the walls can be painted with the chosen color, following all the instructions on the can. Depending on the desired finish, a second coat of paint may be applied to ensure even coverage.",
