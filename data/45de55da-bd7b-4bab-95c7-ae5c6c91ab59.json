He thought he was making a break-through, but in reality all he did was assemble a few parts he found online. He was careful to make sure all the pieces worked together, and when he turned it on for the first time he was absolutely delighted that everything worked. The device quickly became a hit, and soon the tech guy was able to make a good living from his invention. He had come a long way from tinkering in his basement.",
