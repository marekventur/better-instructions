  "input": "",
  "output": "One benefit of using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind is that they reduce environmental pollution and carbon emissions. Renewable energy sources are less harmful to the environment because they do not involve burning fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Renewable energy sources rely on natural processes, such as the sun or the wind, that are not depleted. In addition, renewable energy sources create jobs and increase energy security.",
