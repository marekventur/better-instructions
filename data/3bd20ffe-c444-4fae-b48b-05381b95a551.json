  "output": "A wind turbine is a large device that harnesses the wind's kinetic energy, converting it into electrical energy. It is comprised of a tall tower, a rotor, and a generator. The rotor has a number of large blades that are angled, allowing the turbine to capture the most energy from the wind and the generator converts it into usable, clean electricity.",
