  "input": "",
  "output": "Whether you should own a car in the city or just get a ride sharing service depends on your lifestyle and budget. If you live in an area with good public transportation and don't need to use a car regularly, getting a ride sharing service can offer more flexibility and convenience than owning a car. On the other hand, if you travel frequently and need access to your own vehicle at all times, then it might be better for you to own a car.",
