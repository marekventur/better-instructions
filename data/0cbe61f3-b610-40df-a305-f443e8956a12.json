  "instruction": "Based on the following passage, determine the author\u2019s attitude towards the idea that speed is the most important factor in production",
  "input": "The focus on speed in production today is often misguided. Technical proficiency and craftsmanship can take a backseat to the urgency to finish a project quickly. This can be detrimental to the quality of the product, as the diligent worker is not going to be given the time to fix any mistakes that might arise from haste.",
  "output": "The author holds a negative attitude towards the idea that speed is the most important factor in production. They argue that the focus on speed often comes at the expense of technical proficiency and craftsmanship, resulting in lower-quality products. Additionally, the author implies that speeding up production can be detrimental, as the worker does not have sufficient time to fix any mistakes. This indicates that the author believes speed should not be prioritized over quality and craftsmanship.",
