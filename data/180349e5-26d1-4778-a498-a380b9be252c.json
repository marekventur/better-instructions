  "input": "",
  "output": "1. GPT-based NLU models are faster and more accurate than manual annotation.\n2. GPT-based NLU models are more easily customisable and can leverage pre-trained models. \n3. GPT-based models can be applied to a variety of tasks, including language generation, translation, summarisation, etc.\n4. GPT-based NLU models can learn from data in a more efficient manner than traditional methods.\n5. GPT-based NLU models can generate natural language responses which no other technique can reproduce.",
