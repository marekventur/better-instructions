  "output": "If your washing machine is not working properly, there are a few steps you can take to try and resolve the issue. First, check the power source and make sure the machine is plugged in securely. Next, make sure the water supply valves are open and the hoses are connected correctly. If you have an automatic machine, check the settings to make sure they are correct. You can also check the lint filter and clean it if necessary. Finally, inspect the drain hose to make sure it is not clogged or blocked. If all of these steps do not resolve the issue, you will need to call a repair technician.",
