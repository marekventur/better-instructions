  "input": "",
  "output": "Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that companies and organizations can obtain due to their size. This occurs when unit costs of production decrease as the scale of production increases. This is because production costs are spread over a larger output, which allows companies to get discounts on raw materials, increase specialization, and improve operational efficiency.",
