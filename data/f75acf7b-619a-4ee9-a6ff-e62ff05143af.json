  "output": "If there are 200 students in total attending the summer camp and each instructor will have no more than 30 students in their class, what is the minimum number of classes needed for all students to have a class for each subject? \n\nAnswer: 30 classes (since 5 instructors x 30 students = 150 students, the remaining 50 students will need to be arranged in 10 classes, 5 classes per subject).",
