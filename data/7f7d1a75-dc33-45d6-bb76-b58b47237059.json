  "input": "",
  "output": "Prokaryotic cells are small and simple, with no nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. They also have a single circular chromosome and lack membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells are larger and more complex, with a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They also have multiple linear chromosomes and membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotic cells reproduce by binary fission, while eukaryotic cells reproduce through the process of mitosis.",
