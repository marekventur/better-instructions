  "output": "The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse (longest side). This can be explained mathematically by considering a right triangle in which the two shorter sides are represented by x and y and the longest side is represented by z. When the squares of these three sides are calculated and added together, the result is x2 + y2 = z2, which is the Pythagorean Theorem.",
