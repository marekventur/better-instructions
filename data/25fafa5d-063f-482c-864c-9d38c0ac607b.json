  "input": "Noinput",
  "output": "The process of converting liquid water to water vapor, also known as evaporation, occurs when energy from the sun is absorbed by the liquid water molecules, causing them to move faster and faster. As the molecules collide and gain kinetic energy, they spread apart and the liquid begins to evaporate. This increase in kinetic energy causes the molecules to break free from the surface of the liquid and float in the air as water vapor. \n\nThe molecules continue to absorb energy from the sun and become less dense until they are light enough to travel through the air. As the molecules travel further and further away, they eventually cool and condense into droplets. This process starts the cycle all over again.",
