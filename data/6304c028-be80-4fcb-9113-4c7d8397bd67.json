  "input": "",
  "output": "You should offer hands-on assistance to the customer to help them complete the transaction. You could provide step-by-step instructions to the customer by voice and offer to read out any information that is on the screen, such as product descriptions or checkout forms. You could also help the customer choose items by speaking the product name and description out loud. Additionally, if your website has an alternative audio version available (e.g. for product descriptions), you should provide that to your visually impaired customers to increase their chances of successful completion.",
