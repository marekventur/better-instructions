  "input": "",
  "output": "Socialism and communism are both political and economic ideologies that promote the collective and equal ownership of resources and the means of production. However, socialism emphasizes economic democracy and a gradual transition from capitalism, while communism advocates for a classless society and a more rapid transition to a communist society. Additionally, communist governments have generally been more centralized and have a more authoritarian political structure than socialist governments.",
