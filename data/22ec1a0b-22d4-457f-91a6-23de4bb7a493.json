  "output": "Rigor mortis is the stiffening of a body after death. It is due to the depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules and other energy sources in the body, which causes the muscles to become rigid and no longer contract. This process typically begins a few hours after death and can last up to 12 hours.",
