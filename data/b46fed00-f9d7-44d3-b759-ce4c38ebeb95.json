  "output": "One way to reduce data silos is to use a data harmonization approach, which involves standardizing, aligning, and consolidating disparate datasets into a single, unified dataset. This helps avoid the creation of data silos that can lead to costly errors, inefficient processes, and duplication of effort. Additionally, when data mapping is employed to ensure that data elements are in sync, it can make data more easily accessible and serve as a single source of truth in the organization.",
