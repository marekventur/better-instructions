  "output": "Cellular respiration in plants is a complex process in which the plant converts glucose into usable energy. The process begins when the plant takes in carbon dioxide from the environment and combines it with water to form glucose molecules using the energy from sunlight. This glucose is then broken down into simpler molecules of carbon dioxide and water. During this process, the energy released is used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules. ATP is used by the plant to power other processes, such as growth and reproduction. Additionally, the ATP can also be broken down further to produce heat energy, which helps to sustain the plant's temperature. The carbon dioxide and water molecules produced in the process are then released back into the environment to complete the cycle.",
