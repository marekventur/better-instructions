  "input": "<noinput",
  "output": "Quantum entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which particles such as photons, atoms, and molecules become interconnected so that the observable properties of one particle directly affect the observable properties of another particle, even if the two particles are separated by a large distance. In other words, entangled particles are dependent on each other, and changes in one particle will be reflected in the other even if the two are separated by large distances that would take light years to traverse. Quantum entanglement has been used to explain phenomena such as soliton transmission and has been used to harness the power of quantum computing.",
