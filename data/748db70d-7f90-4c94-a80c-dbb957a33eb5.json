  "instruction": "Come up with a healthcare marketing strategy.",
  "input": "Objective: To promote the services of a medical practice to a younger demographic",
  "output": "A healthcare marketing strategy targeting a younger demographic should focus on digital channels, including social media platforms, digital advertising, and email campaigns. To engage this target audience, content should be engaging, informative, and entertaining. In addition, digital outreach should be complemented by traditional marketing tactics, such as print campaigns, TV and radio ads, direct mail, and outdoor advertising. Promotional offers and discounts, such as loyalty programs and referral incentives, may also be used to drive more engagement and loyalty.",
