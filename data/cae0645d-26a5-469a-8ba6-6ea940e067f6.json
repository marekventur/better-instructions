  "input": "",
  "output": "The two main types of primary memory are RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory). RAM is volatile, meaning that data stored in it is lost when the power is turned off. ROM is non-volatile and stores data even when the power is off. RAM allows faster access to data compared to ROM, which stores data permanently but requires more time to access it.",
