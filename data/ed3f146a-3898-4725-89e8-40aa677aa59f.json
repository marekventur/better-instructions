  "input": "",
  "output": "An all-inclusive policy on a university campus would create a more welcoming place for all students. All-inclusivity would help to cultivate a sense of belonging for students who may have otherwise felt marginalized or excluded from certain activities. Additionally, this policy would also help nurture an environment of equality, ensure that everyone has the same access to resources and opportunities, and promote an atmosphere of learning and creativity. By creating a tolerant and all-inclusive learning environment, the university can foster a greater sense of community and encourage students to collaborate, learn and grow.",
