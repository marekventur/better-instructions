  "instruction": "Imagine an alien species. Describe its physical anatomy in detail.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The alien species appears to have a human-like anatomy, with two arms, two legs, and a head with two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. However, the alien\u2019s body is covered in thick, leathery skin which is green in color. Its limbs are much longer than a human's and its fingers are webbed together. Its head is quite large with two antennae that rotate 360 degrees to detect their surroundings. Its eyes are large and black, and its mouth is filled with hundreds of sharp teeth that glow in the dark. Attached to the back of its head is a long whip-like tail that can be used to move in water or climb trees. Its hands and feet have suction cups allowing it to grip onto virtually any surface.",
