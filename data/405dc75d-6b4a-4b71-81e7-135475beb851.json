  "instruction": "Try suggesting two ways of improving the given algorithm.",
  "input": "A sorting algorithm that repeatedly scans through an array of numbers and returns the smallest number.",
  "output": "Two ways of improving this algorithm would be to optimize the comparison of elements and to add an element swapping process. \n\nBy optimizing the comparison of elements, the runtime for the algorithm can be reduced. This can be done by only comparing adjacent elements instead of the entire array. Furthermore, if a list is already partially sorted, the algorithm can be improved by beginning comparisons from the rightmost element that has not been sorted in ascending order. \n\nAdding an element swapping process will ensure that the algorithm returns the sorted array as intended. This swapping process involves swapping the elements which have been identified as the smallest number and the element which is being compared.",
