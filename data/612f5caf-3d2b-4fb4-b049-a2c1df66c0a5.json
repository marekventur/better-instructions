  "input": "Using a pencil and paper to solve a complex problem",
  "output": "Using a pencil and paper to solve a complex problem may not be the best solution because it is often time consuming and inefficient. This approach also requires a substantial amount of knowledge and experience, which may be unavailable or difficult to obtain. In many cases, it can be faster and more effective to use a computerized system with automated tools to process data and generate solutions.",
