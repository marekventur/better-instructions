  "output": "A strategy for managing a large project involves breaking down the project into smaller tasks and creating a timeline to complete each task. Additionally, organizing tasks into categories, such as tasks requiring input from external sources and tasks that have dependencies, can help organize tasks and make them more manageable. Setting deadlines and milestones can also help keep the team on track. Lastly, using management tools to track progress and communicate with the team is essential in managing a project.",
