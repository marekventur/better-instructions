  "input": "For all positive numbers a and b, a+b>a",
  "output": "Proof: Let a and b be two real numbers such that a and b are both positive. By the definition of a real number, we know that a and b are both greater than 0. Therefore, a+b is necessarily greater than a, since a+b is equal to the sum of two numbers that are both greaterthan 0, and thus necessarily greater than each individual component of the sum. Therefore, for all positive numbers a and b, a+b>a.",
