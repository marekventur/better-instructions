  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a family who decided to go on vacation. They packed up their bags, grabbed their passports, and headed to the airport. Once they arrived, they made their way to their destination and set off on their adventure. They went sightseeing, swimming in the ocean, exploring new towns, and tasting all the local cuisine. At the end of their trip, the family was sad to leave but was happy they had such a wonderful time.",
