  "output": "A 3-dimensional coordinate system is a system of location markers in three dimensions, such as X, Y, and Z. This coordinate system can be used to measure distances in three dimensions. Each point on the coordinate system has three coordinates: an x coordinate, y coordinate, and z coordinate. These coordinates together represent the location of a single point in space.",
