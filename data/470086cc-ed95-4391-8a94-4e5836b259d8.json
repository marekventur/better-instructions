  "output": "Dear Friend, \n\nI hope you are doing well. I wanted to take a moment to provide some helpful advice that I hope you will find useful. Firstly, make sure to take time for yourself. When things get busy or stressful, it is important to make sure you get the rest that you need in order to stay productive and be your best. Additionally, remember to surround yourself with those who support and encourage you. It is much easier to reach your goals when you have help and motivation from your loved ones.  \n\nI wish you all the best on your journey! \n\nWarm regards, \n[Name]",
