  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a stack and a queue is the order of operations. A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) structure, while a queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) structure. This means that items are either added to the bottom of a stack or deleted from the top, while items are always added to the back of the queue and deleted from the front.",
