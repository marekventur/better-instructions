  "output": "The fog stalks gently,\nAs if it were a small cat in the night.\nIts stealthy movement is a sign of its might.\nIt steals in like a thief in the night,\nVeiling the trees with its wispy might.\nMy soul builds a cathedral,\nA temple to the fog's glory.\nThe fog blankets me,\nAs if I were its lost story.\nThe world seems forgotten,\nThe fog has taken over.\nMy soul builds a cathedral,\nThat will never fade away or go away.\nThe fog is my solace,\nMy inspiration and my home.\nMy soul builds a cathedral,\nWhere my spirit can roam.",
