  "input": "",
  "output": "A black hole is created when a very massive star runs out of nuclear fuel and its core can no longer resist the stellar gravity. The core collapses inward in a chain reaction that rebounds outward, pushing the outer layers of the star into space in a supernova explosion. Eventually, the core stops collapsing, compressing into a single point of an infinitely small radius and infinitely great density, known as a singularity. This creates an extremely powerful gravitational field which nothing, not even light, can escape, giving rise to its distinctive dark silhouette.",
