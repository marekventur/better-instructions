  "input": "",
  "output": "A recursive function is a function that calls itself, allowing it to solve the same problem over and over with different inputs. This type of function is useful for solving complex problems because it breaks them down into simpler sub-problems that can be reused. Recursion can be used to traverse a tree structure, solve mathematical problems, and other tasks that require breaking down a problem into smaller parts.",
