  "instruction": "Identify the impact of global warming on sea levels.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Global warming is causing sea levels to rise due to melting polar ice caps and the expansion of ocean water as it heats up. This is resulting in higher and more frequent flooding, more severe storms, and increased coastal erosion. Additionally, warmer and more acidic oceans can also lead to species extinction, reduced biodiversity, and disruption of marine food webs.",
