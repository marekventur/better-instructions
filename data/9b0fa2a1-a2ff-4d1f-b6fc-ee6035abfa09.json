  "output": "Ibuprofen is a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is often used to relieve minor pain and reduce inflammation. Studies have shown that ibuprofen can help reduce fever, improve pain relief, reduce joint and muscle discomfort, and reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease. Ibuprofen can also be used to treat some chronic diseases, such as arthritis, as it has been shown to reduce inflammation, stiffness, and discomfort in affected joints and muscles. In general, ibuprofen has been found to have a positive effect on the health outcomes of those who need relief from pain and inflammation.",
