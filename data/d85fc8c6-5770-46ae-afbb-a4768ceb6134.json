  "output": "Mammals and amphibians are two distinct classes of animals that differ significantly in anatomy, physiology, habitat, and lifestyle. Mammals are warm-blooded animals, featuring a fur- or hair-covered skin, specialized lungs, and mammary glands, while amphibians are cold-blooded animals, adapted to both land and water environments. Mammals are typically found in diverse habitats, while amphibians are usually confined to moist, wet environments. Another significant difference is that mammals are air-breathing animals, with well-developed lungs, while amphibians respire by breathing through their skin. The two classes also differ in response to environmental stress. Mammals tend to respond to stress with behavioral changes, whereas amphibians tend to produce physiological and biochemical changes.",
