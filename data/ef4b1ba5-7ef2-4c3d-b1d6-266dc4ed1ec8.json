  "instruction": "How would you use blockchain technology to secure health data?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Blockchain technology can be used to secure health data by using blockchain-based encryption for data storage, tokenizing and encrypting patient records, and using smart contracts to control data sharing and access. By encrypting sensitive data, it ensures that only people with access are able to view that information. Tokenizing data can help identify the person, group, department, or other entity associated with the data. Smart contracts can automate complex processes, such as access control to patient records, and ensure that patient data is only accessed by authorized parties.",
