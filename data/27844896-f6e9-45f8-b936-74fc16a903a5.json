  "output": "One way to motivate elderly people to exercise is to get them to set goals and reward themselves when they reach those goals. Setting sensible, manageable aims can help older people stay focused on their exercise routine. Additionally, adding a social element to exercise can be beneficial. Group activities or classes can help motivate the elderly by providing a sense of social interaction and inclusion. Finally, providing motivation in the form of rewards for reaching goals can further encourage elderly people to keep exercising. This could take form of small gifts or treats such as a nutritious snack or special items.",
