  "output": "Airbenders are capable of manipulating the air through their martial arts and gliding. They can create powerful gusts of wind and whirlwinds, shoot powerful blasts of air from their hands, bend and shape the air into powerful shields and eddies, and use their breath to control directional gusts of wind. They can also fly with the help of an air glove and a glider, as well as levitate and manipulate objects with their breath. Furthermore, they can create illusions, turning themselves into clouds and mist.",
