  "input": "This paper examines the performance of students with dyslexia in different learning environments.",
  "output": "This study found that students with dyslexia perform better in learning environments which employ visual-spatial tools and strategies. The use of such tools and strategies can have significant positive impacts on the academic performance of students with dyslexia. Furthermore, the study showed that the structure of the learning environment is also important in optimising the performance of students with dyslexia. Therefore, learning environments should be designed in such a way to take into account the specific needs of students with dyslexia.",
