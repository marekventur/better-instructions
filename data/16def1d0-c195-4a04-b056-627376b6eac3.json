  "input": "",
  "output": "The Crick\u2013Watson model, proposed by Francis Crick and James Watson in 1953, is an important model in genetics. It describes the structure of DNA and provided a scientific explanation for the transmission of genetic information from parents to offspring. The model also showed how genetic information is expressed and helps explain how mutations occur due to changes in DNA structure.",
