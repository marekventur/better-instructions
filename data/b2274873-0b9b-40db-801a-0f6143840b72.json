  "input": "",
  "output": "English is a difficult language to learn because it has so many variations in grammar and pronunciation. Its sentence structure can be extremely confusing, due to its many exceptions to the rules. English has borrowed words from a wide range of languages, making it hard to remember the origins and usage of words. Furthermore, the vast number of colloquial phrases, slang and idioms makes it difficult to gain an accurate understanding of spoken English.",
