  "instruction": "Choose five natural disasters and explain what causes each one.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Five natural disasters are avalanches, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes. \n\nAvalanches are caused by a large amount of snow falling or sliding down a mountain in a short period of time.\n\nFloods occur when heavy rains, thunderstorms, or snowmelt cause water to overflow its banks. \n\nHurricanes are powerful tropical storms with strong winds and heavy rain that form over warm ocean waters.\n\nTornadoes are strong columns of rotating air that can reach speeds of more than 300 mph.\n\nEarthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy from the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.",
