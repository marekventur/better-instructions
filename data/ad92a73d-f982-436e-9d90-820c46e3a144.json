  "output": "Augmented reality (AR) can be used to create interactive in-store experiences, allow customers to virtually try on clothes and products before they buy them, streamline the shopping experience, and improve accuracy in delivery. AR can also be used to improve customer service, providing customers with support and engaging them with interactive tutorials. AR can also be used to provide enhanced visuals in education, providing contextualized 3D models and simulations to replace traditional textbooks in educational settings.",
