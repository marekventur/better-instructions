  "input": "",
  "output": "A number of approaches can help to reduce gender bias in the workplace. These include providing unconscious bias training to all employees, creating gender-inclusive policies, offering flexible work arrangements, such as work-from-home opportunities, reducing gender-segregated job titles, and actively recruiting females for positions of leadership. Additionally, more companies are turning to diverse hiring boards and leadership, which can provide broader perspectives and help to reduce any entrenched gender bias.",
