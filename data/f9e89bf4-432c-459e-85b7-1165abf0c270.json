  "input": "",
  "output": "Listening represents the act of consciously paying attention to a sound or conversation, whereas hearing refers to an involuntary biological process of sound detection. Hearing does not require the individual to actively engage or comprehend the sound or conversation. Listening requires effort and focus, but hearing requires no effort. Listening is an active process that requires attention, whereas hearing is a passive process. Additionally, listening is a part of the interpersonal aspects of communication, such as understanding and responding, whereas hearing does not necessarily require engagement with the sound or conversation.",
