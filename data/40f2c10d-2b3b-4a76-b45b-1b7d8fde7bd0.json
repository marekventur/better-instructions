  "input": "",
  "output": "Analog signal processing involves the use of continuous physical phenomena, such as currents and voltages, to move, store and manipulate data. It uses analog components, such as resistors and capacitors, to convert an analog signal into a digital signal.\n\nDigital signal processing, on the other hand, involves the conversion of an analog signal into a digital signal and then the manipulation of the data using digital components, such as logic gates and flip-flops. Digital signals are composed of discrete values, making them easier to process and understand. Digital signal processing also allows for greater accuracy and precision than analog signal processing, as errors can be minimized due to the use of mathematical algorithms.",
