  "input": "",
  "output": "The impacts of autonomous robots could be minimized by creating policies to regulate their use and development, such as regulations limiting the types of data that can be collected, as well as specific rules for the operation and maintenance of robots. Additionally, the development of robots should involve careful consideration of their potential impacts on employment, wages, and the environment. Finally, governments should also invest in training and education to ensure that workers are prepared for the jobs that will be created as a result of this technology, as well as to provide support for those who may be adversely affected.",
