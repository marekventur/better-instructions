  "output": "A cow is a domesticated hoofed mammal that is part of the bovine family. The typical cow is black and white in color, though there are other variations such as brown, red and dun. They have long horns and pointed or rounded ears. Cows are herbivores, and their diet consists mainly of grass and other plants. The breed of cow is typically determined by its size, color, and purpose. Dairy cows have been bred for hundreds of generations and are especially well-suited for milk production. Meat cows, when raised properly, are known for their lean muscular meat. Cows usually require a large space and can live up to 10-20 years.",
