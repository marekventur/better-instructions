  "instruction": "Compose a musical piece that lasts 1 minute.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The musical piece begins with a flute playing soothing and melodic tones, accompanied by the light strumming of a guitar providing gentle chords. As the piece progresses, a violin joins in with a cascading melody as the background changes to a piano playing deep and vibrant chords. As the piece reaches its climax, the drums join in and the song becomes more lively, drawing in the energy of the other instruments. The piece continues to build towards its climax and finally resolves back to the original flute melody.",
