The Law of Inertia: An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion, with the same speed and in the same direction, unless acted upon by an external force. \n2. The Law of Acceleration: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied, and inversely proportional to its mass.\n3. The Law of Action and Reaction: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
