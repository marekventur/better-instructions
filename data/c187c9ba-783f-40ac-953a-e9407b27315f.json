  "output": "The setting of the horror movie is in a town isolated in the mountains. It is raining heavily outside and the darkness of the stormy night sets the perfect atmosphere for fear and suspense. The town is eerily empty, the absence of street lights adding to the feeling of dread as shadows move in between the buildings, creating an even darker atmosphere.",
