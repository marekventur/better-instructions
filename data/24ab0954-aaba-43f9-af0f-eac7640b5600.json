Humans must work to save endangered species to ensure their protection against human-caused environmental harm and extinction. Besides protecting the Earth and its diverse species, preserving endangered species helps in preserving our own health and wellbeing as it is important for maintaining food sources, fresh air, and developing new medicines. Taking proactive steps such as habitat and population protection, re-introduction programs, and responsible tourism and trade will ensure the safeguarding of endangered species.",
