  "output": "My life is like a flowing river, \nan ever-changing course of a giver. \nMy path has many hidden treasures, \nlike deep secrets that only hurricanes measure.\n\nTime is like a ticking clock, \nas I move through a door to an invisible lock. \nEach moment brings its own surprise, \nand in the blink of an eye I'm in another land of size.\n\nMy soul is like an open book, \nfilled with moments that a harp begins to crook. \nMany truths I have yet to find, \nlike soft thunders that linger in my mind.\n\nMy heart is like a beating drum, \nit takes me to the heights of an angelic hum. \nLove is my guiding path and hope, \nit teaches me to be light, instead of mope. \n\nMy journey is like a new canvas, \nfilled with colors and stories without notice. \nIt is each to their own and I have found, \nfor each door I open, something profound.",
