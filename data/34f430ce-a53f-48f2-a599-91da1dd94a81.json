  "output": "Two strategies for reducing student debt include:\n1. Finding scholarships or grants. Scholarships and grants are a great way to reduce student debt as they are given out on the basis of financial need or merit, and do not need to be repaid. \n2. Applying for income-based repayment plans. Income-based repayment plans calculate a student\u2019s monthly payment based on their income, family size, and the total amount of the loan. This ensures that the student's monthly payments are more manageable and can be adjusted if their income changes.",
