  "input": "",
  "output": "The evolution of the automobile has come a long way. The first internal combustion engine-powered car was invented in 1885. Since then, the automobile has been through many iterations, with the invention of the self-starter, power windows, traction control, cruise control, and many more features that make the driving experience easier and safer. Autonomous vehicles have been on the horizon since the 1950s and are now beginning to be released onto the market, allowing cars to drive themselves. With the advent of electric cars, the automobile is changing the way we think about transportation and the environment, with cars powered by renewable energy sources and a reduction in air pollution. With constant advancements in automobile technology, the future of our driving experience looks to be even more efficient, comfortable, and safe.",
