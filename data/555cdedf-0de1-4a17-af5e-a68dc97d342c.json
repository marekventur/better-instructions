Such a walk can be used when one wants to explore a place randomly, or to find the best route to a destination. This word is derived from the skiing sport slalom, which involves going around obstacles and gates while skiing downhill.  Thus, slalomwalk may evoke someone dancing their way down the street due to the circling and weaving motions a slalomwalk requires.",
