  "instruction": "Describe an example of ocean acidification.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Ocean acidification is a process in which the pH of the ocean decreases over time due to the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This CO2 is then turned into carbonic acid, which lowers the pH of the ocean and makes it more acidic. As a result of ocean acidification, coral reefs, which rely on a specific pH to survive, are harmed, leading to a decrease in their populations.",
