  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Artificial intelligence could lead to job displacement, as machines can increasingly perform a wide variety of tasks and functions more efficiently than humans.\n2. AI could be used to manipulate people by exploiting and exploiting patterns in our behavior and preferences.\n3. AI could lead to increased privacy and security risks, since many AI systems rely on extremely sensitive data that could be used to create malicious are predictive models.\n4. AI could reduce human creativity and problem solving skills, as people may become more reliant on automated solutions and less creative by default.\n5. Finally, AI could lead to a greater divide between those with access to technology and those without, resulting in an even greater wealth and power gap than currently exists.",
