  "input": "",
  "output": "An atom is made up of a small, dense nucleus surrounded by electrons that are arranged in shells around the nucleus. The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines what type of atom it is. Electrons orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels known as \"shells\" and are negatively charged. These shells are filled with electrons in a specific order and each shell can only hold a certain number of electrons.\n\nThe model of an atom consists of a sphere that represents the nucleus in the center of the atom, surrounded by rings that show where the shells are located. The protons and neutrons are represented by small spheres in the nucleus and the electrons are represented by small spheres that are placed at different distances from the nucleus, each representing a different shell.",
