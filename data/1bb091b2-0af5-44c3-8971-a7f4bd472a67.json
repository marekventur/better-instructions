  "output": "The main components of electromagnetic radiation are electric and magnetic fields which vibrate perpendicular to each other and travel in the form of waves at the speed of light. Electromagnetic radiation is composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that transfer energy through space in the form of light, radio waves, gamma rays, X-rays and infrared radiation. Electromagnetic waves are categorized by their frequency and energy.",
