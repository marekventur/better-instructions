  "output": "A training exercise to help employees become more creative could involve getting employees to brainstorm ideas individually first and then to discuss their ideas in groups. The groups can be divided into smaller teams and each team can come up with their own ideas and present their ideas to the other groups. This would allow for discussion and engagement between groups and also offers a degree of competition. After each group has presented their ideas, the entire group can vote on the best idea and the team with the most votes would gain recognition.",
