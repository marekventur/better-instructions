  "input": "The President announced yesterday a plan to increase the budget for defense by 10%, amounting to over 1 trillion dollars in the next 6 years.",
  "output": "This plan could have major implications on military spending, domestic economic policy, and foreign relations. On the military side, the extra funding could be used to modernize and maintain equipment, expand the military forces, or develop new weapons systems. From an economic point of view, the additional spending could help stimulate the economy and create jobs. On the foreign relations front, the extra funding could be used to win allies or make potential adversaries cautious. This could increase US influence around the world in both diplomatic and military terms.",
