  "input": "",
  "output": "A bubble sort algorithm is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by comparing each element and its immediate neighbor, and if the element is greater than its neighbor then the two elements are swapped. This process of comparison and swapping continues until the entire array is sorted in ascending order.",
