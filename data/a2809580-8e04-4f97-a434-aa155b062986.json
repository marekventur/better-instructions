  "output": "Fast fashion is impacting the environment in many ways. It often involves unsustainable sourcing of materials, and the overproduction of clothes can quickly lead to a surplus, leading to a tremendous amount of wastage. Furthermore, the use of hazardous chemicals in producing clothes has a detrimental effect on air, water, and soil pollution. Additionally, the packaging and transportation associated with fast fashion is also contributing to environmental degradation.",
