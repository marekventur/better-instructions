  "instruction": "Create a linear equation illustrating the relationship between hours and rate of pay.",
  "input": "A freelance job pays $250 per hour.",
  "output": "The linear equation illustrating the relationship between hours and rate of pay is y = 250x, where y is the total rate of pay and x is the number of hours worked. In this case, if the freelance job pays $250 per hour, then for one hour of work the rate of pay is $250, for two hours of work the rate of pay is $500, and so on.",
