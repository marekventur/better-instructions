  "input": "",
  "output": "One disadvantage of artificial intelligence is that it can be difficult to anticipate the implications of artificial intelligence technologies and to control their usage. AI systems can be prone to making unpredictable decisions, and these decisions can have serious consequences. For example, AI systems can reflect the biases and errors inherent in the data they are given, leading to biased decision-making or incorrect results. Because of this, it can be difficult to trust the accuracy and safety of AI-generated decisions.",
