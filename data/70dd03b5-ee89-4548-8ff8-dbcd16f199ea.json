  "input": "Uber has been one of the leading companies in the ride-sharing industry since its launch in 2009. It has disrupted the transportation industry, creating a business model in which it acts as a middleman between two parties: the rider and the driver. Uber\u2019s main service offering includes a mobile app and website, which allows riders to request a ride from an available driver. This ride can be paid for using Uber\u2019s payment system, which was developed in partnership with a variety of third-party processors. The company also offers various add-on services, such as \u201cUberPool\u201d, which allows riders to share a ride with other riders to save money, and \u201cUberRush\u201d, which allows riders to schedule a ride for a future time.",
