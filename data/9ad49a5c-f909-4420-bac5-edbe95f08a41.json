  "input": "",
  "output": "Whales migrate for several reasons, including seeking food, avoiding predators, and finding suitable breeding grounds. In warm months, whales migrate to cooler waters where they can find an abundant food source, such as krill, squid, and small fish. In colder months, they return to warmer waters, where they are safer from predators, such as sharks and orcas, and can find sheltered areas to calve and breed. Additionally, some migrating whales use specific pathways over long distances to move between breeding and feeding grounds.",
