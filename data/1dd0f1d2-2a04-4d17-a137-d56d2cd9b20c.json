  "input": "",
  "output": "I propose introducing stricter regulation on the production and use of plastic, as plastic waste is polluting our planet and creating a negative environmental impact. We can incentivize the reduction of plastic consumption with taxes, cutting incentives for companies, and requiring more extensive recycling programs. We can also provide educational campaigns that raise awareness on the negative effects of plastic consumption and increase community enforcement of recycling regulations.",
