  "output": "The black widow spider is a species of arachnid known for its distinctive black and red colouration. The female black widow is particularly notable for its dangerous venom, which is used to hunt and kill its prey. Black widow spiders tend to prefer dark, hidden places such as crevices and woodpiles. They are typically found in temperate and subtropical climates, and are usually nocturnal, becoming active at night. The black widow has an elongated body with the female often reaching a 14mm length, significantly larger than the male. Its abdomen is typically round and bulbous-shaped with a distinct red hourglass marking on the underside. The legs are very long and spindly in comparison to other spiders due to their habit of building webs. Overall, the black widow is an easily recognizable and highly feared predator in the spider world.",
