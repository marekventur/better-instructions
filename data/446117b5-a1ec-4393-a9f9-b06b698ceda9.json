  "output": "Ice cream and gelato are both popular and delicious desserts. Although both desserts are usually served cold, there are several important differences between them. Ice cream is traditionally made with cream, eggs and sugar, while gelato is typically made with more milk and less cream. Gelato also contains less air, making it denser and more flavorful than ice cream. In terms of nutritional content, gelato tends to have more calories, fat and sugar than ice cream.",
