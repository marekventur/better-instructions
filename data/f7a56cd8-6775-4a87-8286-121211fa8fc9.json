  "output": "Deep learning is a form of artificial intelligence that uses neural networks to process data and extract insights. The process of deep learning involves gathering data, pre-processing it, feeding it into the deep neural network for training, testing with validation data, and deploying the model in real-world applications. During training, the model weights and parameters are adjusted as the neural network is exposed to the data, to learn patterns and mimic human cognition. After training, the model is tested with validation data to measure its accuracy and performance, and then it is deployed in real-world applications.",
