  "input": "",
  "output": "The primary difference between academic writing and creative writing is the purpose of the writing. Academic writing is intended to explain and inform, while creative writing is intended to evoke emotion, explore ideas, and create a narrative. Academic writing typically involves more strict rules and formatting conventions, such as specific citation styles, to ensure accuracy and objectivity. Creative writing is often more flexible, allowing for the expression of personal ideas and perspectives. Academic writing often requires research and a more formal language, while creative writing often encompasses the use of creative language and imagery. Additionally, creative writing often has the purpose of entertaining and exploring artistic elements, while academic writing is primarily concerned with imparting knowledge.",
