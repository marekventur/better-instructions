  "output": "One application of machine learning is the use of facial recognition systems for security and identification purposes. Facial recognition systems are increasingly being used to identify people from their facial features, such as in airport security, law enforcement, banking, and surveillance systems. These systems analyze an individual's facial characteristics and compare it with a stored image of the same individual, allowing for quick and accurate verification. This technology is also used for automated customer service identification, process automation in businesses, and targeted marketing campaigns.",
