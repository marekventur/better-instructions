  "input": "",
  "output": "Holographic imaging and x-ray imaging are two different types of scanning technologies. X-rays are a form of radiation, while holographic imaging uses lasers and light to create a 3D image. X-rays provide an image of the inside of the body, while holographic imaging creates a 3D reconstruction of the outside of the body. X-rays can penetrate through solid materials, while holographic imaging typically cannot. Both technologies are used to aid in diagnosis and image interpretation.",
