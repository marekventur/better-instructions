  "instruction": "Describe in detail the consequences of overcrowding in cities.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Overcrowding in cities can lead to a wide range of issues, ranging from health and sanitation problems to housing shortages and skyrocketing living costs. Overcrowded areas often suffer from poor air quality, inadequate resources such as clean water, an increased risk of infectious diseases, and increased levels of stress. Higher unemployment rates, crime rates, and violence can also be seen in densely populated areas. These issues are further exacerbated by a lack of green spaces and the strain placed on infrastructure\u2014schools, hospitals, and public transportation\u2014by the growing number of people living in the area. Finally, overcrowding can lead to feelings of social isolation and depression.",
