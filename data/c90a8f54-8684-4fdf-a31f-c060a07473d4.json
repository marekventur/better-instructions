  "output": "Adding renewable energy sources to the energy mix is an important challenge for today\u2019s society. There are two main approaches to solving this problem: Nuclear Energy and Renewable Energy. \n\nNuclear energy sources produce large amounts of power from a small footprint and have low-emissions. However, it involves the use of hazardous materials; and investments into nuclear power plants may have a long time frame and require a lot of money.\n\nRenewable energy sources are renewable, non-polluting and don\u2019t produce hazardous materials. Renewable energy sources are typically easier to install and maintain than nuclear plant investments and fuel supply chains, which take a long time to set up. They also have a lower cost of production, and provide more economic benefits to consumers. \n\nIn conclusion, both nuclear and renewable energy sources have their advantages and disadvantages when it comes to solving this challenge. It is ultimately up to the government or local regulatory boards to decide what type of energy source is best suited for their area.",
