  "output": "Creating a hashtag for a social media post is a great way to spread the reach of your post and join conversations about your topic. The general format for a hashtag is \"#[keyword]\". The keyword can be one word, like \"#summer\" or it can be a combination of words, like \"#scienceisfun\". It's important to make the keyword relevant to your post so potential viewers can easily find it. Additionally, you should use between 2 and 6 words in your hashtag and make sure to only use letters, numbers, and underscores.",
