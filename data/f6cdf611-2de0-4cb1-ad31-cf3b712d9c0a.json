  "output": "The Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919 at the end of World War I and is seen as a major cause of World War II. It was an attempt to bring peace and order to Europe after the war and establish new boundaries between countries. It also imposed harsh reparations on Germany, which caused resentment among the German people. The Treaty of Versailles also affirmed the importance of self-determination and the League of Nations, setting the groundwork for international treaties and diplomacy.",
