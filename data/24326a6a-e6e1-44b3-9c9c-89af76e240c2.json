  "input": "",
  "output": "Climate change needs to be urgently addressed because the effects are already being felt around the world, from droughts in Australia to flooding in the United States. It is causing extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and a decline in biodiversity, which threatens the survival of many species and human livelihoods.
