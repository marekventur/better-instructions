  "input": "",
  "output": "Humans brains are better at recognizing patterns than computers because they are able to process complex, multidimensional information and draw on prior experience and knowledge to better determine what is meaningful and what isn\u2019t. Computers can crunch huge amounts of data, but they lack the intuition and contextual understanding of humans. Human brains also have greater flexibility when it comes to pattern recognition. We can recognize patterns in different contexts and under different conditions, while computers struggle to account for changes in variables. Additionally, the human brain has a greater capacity for pattern recognition due to its neural network structure, which allows for faster connections and greater complexity than a computer\u2019s flat or single-layer circuitry.",
