  "input": "",
  "output": "The algorithm to make a digital photo montage can be constructed as follows:\n\n1. Acquire two or more photos that are of a similar size and perspective.\n2. Identify the main features to be merged in the montage.\n3. Apply a common transformation to all the photos, such as resizing, rotating and flipping, to make them fit in proportionally.\n4. Identify areas of transition between two photos by selecting the edges which will be merged and adjusting them to blend in with each other.\n5. Apply color adjustment to match the colors of the two images and achieve harmony.\n6. Merge the main features of the photo together using advanced blending modes.\n7. Sharpen the image to smooth out any pixels.\n8. Output the montage in the desired format such as JPG or PNG.",
