  "output": "The theme of loyalty is one of the most prominent motifs in Harper Lee's classic novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. Throughout the story, loyalty is demonstrated by the actions of Atticus Finch, the main character's father. Atticus is fiercely loyal to his family, to his friends, and to his moral beliefs. This loyalty serves as an example for his daughter and son, teaching them that it is important to stick by and defend those you care about. Scout, the main character, learns to be loyal to others, even if she does not agree with their beliefs or behaviors. The story also explores the idea of loyalty to one's community and to the greater good. Despite facing intense persecution, Atticus remains loyal to his community and stands up for justice. His actions demonstrate that loyalty should be unconditional and that our loyalties should ultimately be to the greater good and to justice.",
