  "input": "",
  "output": "I propose a comprehensive plan to tackle climate change. The plan involves both mitigation and adaptation: \n\n1. Mitigation: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, promoting energy efficiency and conservation, and encouraging the development of low-carbon technologies. \n\n2. Adaptation: Prepare for the effects of climate change by promoting sustainable land use, relocating vulnerable populations, and developing strategies to address food and water shortages.\n\nIn addition, the plan should make provision for public education and awareness, funding of research and development, and international collaboration.",
