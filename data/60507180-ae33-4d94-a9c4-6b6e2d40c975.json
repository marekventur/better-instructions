  "input": "",
  "output": "A living algorithm is a model of a physical system that continuously learns from its environment in order to optimize its behaviors. It is an evolutionary algorithm that can adapt and self-improve in unpredictable environments. These algorithms are inspired by nature and are used to solve complex optimization tasks that are difficult for traditional algorithmic approaches.",
