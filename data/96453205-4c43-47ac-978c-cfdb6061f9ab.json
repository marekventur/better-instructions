  "output": "A good way to study for a test is to create a plan and schedule that works for you. Break up the material you need to learn into manageable chunks and start studying each one several days before the test. During your study session, review the material, make flashcards, and practice answering questions. As the day of the test approaches, review your notes and take practice tests.",
