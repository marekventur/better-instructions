  "output": "Cloud computing offers a number of advantages that make it an attractive solution for businesses of all sizes. It provides cost savings due to the low infrastructure investment needed to develop or access a cloud-based service, scalability due to the ability to quickly and easily adjust resources to meet current and changing needs, and faster application development, as cloud-based applications can be built and deployed quickly with minimal setup. Additionally, cloud computing can provide a better user experience, as users can access their data and applications from any device and location, and greater security, as data can be stored and backed up in multiple locations.",
