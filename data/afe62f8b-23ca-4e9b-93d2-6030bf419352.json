  "instruction": "Come up with a creative activity that uses at least 5 elements of art (line, shape, texture, size, and color).",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Create your own abstract artwork using the 5 elements of art: line, shape, texture, size, and color. Begin by cutting out a variety of shapes in different sizes from different colors of construction or craft papers. Experiment with each shape and texture by running them through a crimper or by tearing/shredding them. Once finished with the shapes, arrange them on the page in a formation to create depth and contrast using the 5 elements of art. Fill the surface with line to further enhance the texture or apply colors to certain shapes for emphasis. Feel free to use additional supplies such as paints, markers, and glitter to further enhance the artwork.",
