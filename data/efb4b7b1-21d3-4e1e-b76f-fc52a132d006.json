  "output": "To explain fractions in a math class, you could have students design their own pizza. Have them divide their pizza into halves, thirds, fourths, and so on. Ask them to count the number of slices they now have and then explain how each is a fraction of the original pizza. This creative exercise can help make learning fractions more enjoyable and interactive.",
