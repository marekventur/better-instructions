  "output": "Arguments for the death penalty:\nProponents of the death penalty argue that it serves as a deterrent to crime, as criminals fear the ultimate consequence of their actions. They also argue that it provides justice to the victims and their families, as the perpetrator will no longer be able to commit any further crimes.\n\nArguments against the death penalty:\nOpponents of the death penalty argue that it is flawed and can lead to innocent people being executed. They also argue that it is inhumane and expensive to carry out, while not necessarily providing a deterrent to crime. It can also lead to disparities in sentencing based on race, gender and social standing.",
