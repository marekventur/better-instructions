  "output": "A common side effect of antibiotics is an upset stomach, which can include symptoms such as feeling sick, stomach aches and pains, nausea, and vomiting. Other side effects may include skin rash, sensitivity to sunlight, changes in appetite, diarrhea, and changes in the normal bacteria in the gut. Antibiotics can also interfere with the effectiveness of other medications, such as birth control pills. More rarely, they can cause allergic reactions such as shortness of breath, rash, or anaphylaxis. Long-term use of antibiotics can also damage the health of the microbiome, an essential part of the human body, so it is important to only take antibiotics when they are prescribed.",
