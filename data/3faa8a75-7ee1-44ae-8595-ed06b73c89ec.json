  "output": "Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and can be described as the energy possessed by an object due to its velocity or mass. Potential energy, on the other hand, is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration. Examples of potential energy include gravitational potential energy, chemical potential energy, and elastic potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, while potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration.",
