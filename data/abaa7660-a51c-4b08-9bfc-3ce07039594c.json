  "input": "",
  "output": "Three prominent figures who practiced civil disobedience are Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks. Gandhi led numerous nonviolent protests in India during the twentieth century to oppose the British Raj. Martin Luther King, Jr. organized a series of protests and boycotts in the American South during the 1950s and 1960s to advocate for the civil rights of African Americans. Finally, Rosa Parks, an African-American woman, famously refused to give her seat up to a white person on a bus in Alabama in 1955, inspiring many in the civil rights movement.",
