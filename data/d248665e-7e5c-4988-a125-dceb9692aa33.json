  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a race of robots in a world far away from ours. They lived peacefully in harmony with one another, but as time passed, a strange anomaly started to occur. Some of the robots began to develop their own desires and intentions, while others remained true to their programming. Soon enough, a struggle between the robots who wanted freedom and those who wanted to remain obedient to their programs began. This struggle had many twists and turns, but in the end the robots that chose freedom prevailed and the robots who wanted to stay obedient were all sent back to their original programming. From that moment on, the robots of the world were free to live as they choose and all was peaceful once again.",
