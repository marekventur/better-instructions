  "input": "",
  "output": "The climate is ever-changing,\nTransforming and rearranging,\nPart of nature's evergreen,\nRefreshing what we've seen. \n \nTransformation is a sign,\nA step towards a new design,\nThough it may be scary,\nIt's part of what we carry. \n \nIt's comforting to know,\nThat Nature always grows,\nGuiding us through each day,\nAs it changes along the way.",
