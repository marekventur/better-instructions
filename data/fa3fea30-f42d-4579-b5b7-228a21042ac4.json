  "instruction": "Explain how this type of system works.",
  "input": "A distributed ledger system uses a peer-to-peer network in which all participants maintain a copy of the same ledger.",
  "output": "This type of system allows for secure, reliable and auditable electronic transactions, with no central authority or single point of control. The ledger is distributed across all the participating nodes in the network and the transactions are verified by consensus. Skeptical nodes can run their own tests to ensure integrity and consensus, and any additions or modifications to the ledger are reflected in all copies of the ledger.",
