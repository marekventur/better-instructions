  "output": "Inflation is a sustained increase in the average price level of goods and services in an economy, often caused by an increase in the money supply or a decrease in the production of goods and services. Inflation can have a dramatic effect on an economy, leading to increased costs of living and reduced purchasing power of consumers. Consequently, it can lead to reduced investment and consumption, resulting in slower economic growth and reduced employment.",
