  "input": "",
  "output": "Data science is the process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting data to discover insights and patterns, while artificial intelligence is the use of technologies to develop computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Both disciplines are focused on using technology to provide meaningful insights and solutions. Data science can provide the foundation for machine learning, which is used in artificial intelligence algorithms. Both fields overlap in areas such as predictive analytics, NLP, computer vision, and robotics.",
