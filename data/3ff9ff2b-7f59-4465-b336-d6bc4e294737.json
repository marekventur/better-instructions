  "output": "A console user interface (CUI) is a text-based interface typically used on a command-line interface or terminal. It uses characters, such as letters and symbols, rather than graphics or pictures to interact with the user. A graphical user interface (GUI) is a visual interface for displaying information and interactions to the user. It uses graphical elements, such as icons and widgets, to interact with the user. GUI\u2019s are more user-friendly and intuitive than CUI\u2019s.",
