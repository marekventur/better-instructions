  "instruction": "Explain how greenhouse effect works.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, trap heat. The trapped heat warms the atmosphere and surface of the Earth. This process is necessary for the Earth to maintain a livable temperature, however, when too much of the gases are present, the temperature of the atmosphere and surface rises, leading to global warming and climate change.",
