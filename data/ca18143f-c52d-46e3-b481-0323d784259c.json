  "input": "",
  "output": "Bounded rationality is a concept which states that when making decisions, humans are constrained by the limited information they have available, their cognitive abilities, and the amount of time they have to make a decision. This means that people are not able to be completely rational in their decision making and instead rely on heuristics, or mental shortcuts, to help them make decisions quickly and efficiently.",
