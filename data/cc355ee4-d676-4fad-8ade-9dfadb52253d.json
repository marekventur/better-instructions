  "input": "",
  "output": "The Zero Trust Principles refer to an approach to cybersecurity that assumes that no digital or physical asset is inherently trustworthy. This means that digital assets must be verified and authenticated prior to being granted access. To implement Zero Trust Principles, organizations should protect their resources with strong authentication systems, automate security policy enforcement, minimize privileged account usage, and continuously monitor user interactions with resources. Additionally, organizations should employ network segmentation, encryption, data loss prevention, and security analytics. By employing these Zero Trust Principles, organizations can ensure that no malicious actor can gain access to sensitive data or disrupt normal operations.",
