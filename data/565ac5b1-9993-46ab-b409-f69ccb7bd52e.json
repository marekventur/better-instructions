  "input": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has called for tougher sentences against people who commit acts of hate speech and fake news.",
  "output": "I view this call to action by Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari as timely and necessary. Fake news is a pervasive issue in our society, and I believe stronger punishments are necessary to discourage people from engaging in it. Hate speech has no place in any society and must be combatted by authorities. It is encouraging to see a country taking the initiative to combat fake news and hate speech.",
