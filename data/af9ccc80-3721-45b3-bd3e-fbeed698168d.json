  "output": "If my car breaks down on a highway, I would first make sure the car is in a safe location and I have activated my car's hazard lights. Then, I would contact roadside assistance services, or contact a tow truck if necessary. Additionally, I would remain in my car and wait for help to arrive. To keep myself safe, I would make sure that I stay in the car, put on my seatbelt, and remain visible to passing traffic.",
