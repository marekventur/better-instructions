  "output": "Investing in human capital is one of the most effective ways to reduce poverty in developing countries. This includes investments in education, health care, and infrastructure which can help to create job opportunities and growth potential, while providing vulnerable populations with access to the resources they need to sustain themselves and their families. Governments should also focus on promoting agricultural policies, improving access to financial services, and ensuring a fair and effective tax system, in order to combat poverty more effectively.",
