  "input": "",
  "output": "Three effects of climate change in Africa include:\n1. Increase in temperatures: Rising temperatures are causing increased evaporation, leading to more extreme droughts in some areas, while other areas are seeing an increase in flooding and vegetation loss.\n2. Decrease in crop yield: An increase in temperatures is leading to poorer yields of staple crops such as maize, sorghum, and millet.\n3. Increase in disease: An increased prevalence of diseases such as malaria, cholera, and other water-borne diseases is linked to climate change in Africa. Higher temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns create new breeding grounds for disease-causing insects.",
