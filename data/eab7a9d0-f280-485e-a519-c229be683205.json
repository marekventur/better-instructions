  "output": "Animal rights refer to the idea that animals should be afforded respect, and their lives should be valued equally with humans. It is based on the premise that animals are conscious and have their own desires, needs, and pain, and are deserving of moral consideration, just like humans. Animal rights advocates seek to ensure that animals, both wild and domestic, are treated humanely and given the right to exist without human interference or exploitation.",
