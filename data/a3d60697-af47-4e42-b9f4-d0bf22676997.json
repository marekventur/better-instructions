  "instruction": "Tell me what a Hemangioma is and how it is treated.",
  "input": "Noinput",
  "output": "A Hemangioma is a benign tumor composed of blood vessels. It is usually present at birth or within the first few months of life, although it can appear later in childhood. Treatment of this condition depends on the size, location, and duration of the Hemangioma. Small Hemangiomas often go away on their own without treatment, but larger ones may require laser therapy, steroids, or other medications. Surgery may also be an option.",
