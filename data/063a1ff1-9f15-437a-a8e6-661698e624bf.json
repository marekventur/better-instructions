  "input": "Webinar and Ebook",
  "output": "Both webinars and ebooks can be used as lead magnets to attract new customers, but each offers its own unique set of benefits. Webinars are a great way to engage with an audience and provide a live demonstration of your product or service. They also provide the opportunity to answer questions and receive feedback from potential customers. On the other hand, ebooks require less effort to create and can provide in-depth information about your products and services in an easily-digestible format. They are versatile and can be shared widely, either as downloadable files or embedded on your website. Additionally, ebooks are cost-effective and can be used to promote your business to a wider audience.",
