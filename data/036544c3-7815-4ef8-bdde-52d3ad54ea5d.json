  "input": "",
  "output": "A professional chef will cut a mango with a sharp knife, beginning by slicing off the stem end. Using the same knife, they will slice the mango lengthwise, getting as close to the pit as possible. Then the chef will use a spoon to scoop out the flesh. They can use the slices for dicing or cubes, or just enjoy the half without cutting further.",
