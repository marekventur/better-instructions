  "output": "Art is essential in education because it encourages creativity, critical thinking, problem solving, and collaboration. Art introduces students to different cultures and gives them a way to express themselves. Moreover, art contributes to development, as it encourages innovation, provides psychological benefits, and gives students a visual way to learn and understand concepts. Art provides an outlet for students to tap into their imagination and creates opportunities for them to think and express themselves in creative ways.",
