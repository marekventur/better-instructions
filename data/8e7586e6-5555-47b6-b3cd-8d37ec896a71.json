  "input": "",
  "output": "Needs and wants are both desired outcomes. Though they are often used interchangeably, there are distinct differences. Needs are essential for survival and well-being - think of food, shelter, clothing. Wants, on the other hand, are desires that are not essential for survival, although they may make life more enjoyable - think of a luxurious car, expensive jewelry, and other items of status or pleasure. It is important to understand the difference between needs and wants; this can help us prioritize our spending and make sure we can provide the essentials for ourselves and our families.",
