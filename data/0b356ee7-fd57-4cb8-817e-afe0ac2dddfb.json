  "output": "The Battle of Waterloo was an important clash in the Napoleonic Wars, fought on 18 June 1815 near Waterloo in present-day Belgium. It is considered one of the most decisive battles in European history, as the combined armies of the British and Prussian forces defeated the French army led by Napoleon Bonaparte. The British-led army held its positions for several hours in the face of a furious French assault that ultimately failed, leading to a decisive victory for the allies and the end of Napoleon's rule in Europe.",
