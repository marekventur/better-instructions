  "input": "",
  "output": "The difference between quantum physics and classical physics is that quantum physics deals with interactions on an atomic and subatomic level, while classical physics deals with interactions at the macroscopic level. In quantum physics, the behavior of particles is unpredictable, as there is an uncertainty in the behavior of particles due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. On the other hand, in classical physics, the behavior of particles is predictable, as the laws of classical physics are deterministic. Additionally, quantum physics makes use of mathematical formulas like wave functions and matrix mechanics, while classical physics makes use of mathematical formulas like Newton's laws of motion. Finally, in quantum mechanics, interactions between particles can exist across vast distances, while in classical physics, interactions are limited to bodies that are in physical contact.",
