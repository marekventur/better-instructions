  "output": "The Jilfig is a small creature with a short body that resembles an oversized pigeon. It has large, round eyes that appear to be made of glass, and long, thick feathers that range in color from brown to black. It has a long beak that is used for both feeding and communication, as it is capable of making a wide range of both bird and humanlike sounds. Unlike normal birds, Jilfigs have wings which they use to hover in midair while they interact with one another. They typically congregate in groups of three or four and can often be found in parks or gardens, enjoying the warm air and watching the humans go by.",
