  "output": "The key causes of the French Revolution were the inequality between the nobility and clergy on one hand and the commoners on the other, the economic burden on the population caused by taxes, the poor harvests and rising prices of food, and the influence of the Enlightenment and the American Revolution. Other factors included financial mismanagement by King Louis XVI, the collapse of Mediterranean trade due to war with Great Britain and the Netherlands, and the growing number of discontented peasants, artisans, and merchants.",
