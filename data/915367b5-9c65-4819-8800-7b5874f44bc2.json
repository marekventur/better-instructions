  "output": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important component of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and is vital to sustaining a healthy environment. It is essential in the growth and photosynthesis of plants, which in turn provides us and other animals with oxygen to breathe, as well as food. Carbon dioxide also helps keep the climate stable by trapping incoming solar radiation, preventing the planet from becoming too hot.",
