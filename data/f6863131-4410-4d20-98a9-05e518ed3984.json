  "output": "Fireworks are a type of illuminated entertainment often used to celebrate special occasions. They consist of a vast array of colors, patterns and shapes that are launched into the night sky through the use of explosives. When lit, the explosions cause a spectacular light show that is accompanied by loud crackles and booms. Fireworks have been around for centuries, but remain a popular way to mark special occasions such as the Fourth of July, New Year's Eve, and weddings.",
