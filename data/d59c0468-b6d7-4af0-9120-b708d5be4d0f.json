  "instruction": "Compare and contrast a biconditional statement to a conditional statement.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A conditional statement is a statement that can be expressed as \"if P then Q\", where P is a hypothesis and Q is a conclusion. A biconditional statement is a statement that can be expressed as \"P if and only if Q\", where P and Q are both hypotheses or both conclusions. The difference is that in a conditional statement, the hypothesis could be true but the conclusion could be false, whereas in a biconditional statement, the hypotheses and conclusions must both be true for the statement to be true.",
