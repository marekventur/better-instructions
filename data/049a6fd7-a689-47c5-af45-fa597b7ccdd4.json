  "input": "",
  "output": "Scientists use a variety of evidence to support the theory of evolution, including fossil records, DNA and genetic data, biochemistry, and homologies. Fossils provide evidence of how different organisms have changed over time, while DNA and genetic data help to map out the evolutionary history of different species. Biochemical and structural similarities between species also provide support for the theory, as does the fact that certain features are shared across many species but are adapted to fit their individual environments.",
