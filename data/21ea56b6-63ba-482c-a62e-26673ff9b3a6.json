  "output": "Designing a logo involves careful consideration of the message it should communicate, the colors and font, and the overall design aesthetic. Start by gathering reference images, sketches, and concepts to help visualize your ideas. Afterwards, create mood boards and color palettes before moving onto sketching and vector illustration. When the logo is ready, test it in different contexts by placing it on mockups of various materials, such as packaging, posters, and business cards.",
