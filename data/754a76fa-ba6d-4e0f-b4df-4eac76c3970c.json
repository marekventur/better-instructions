  "input": "",
  "output": "Pandora's Box and the Garden of Eden are both stories that involve the introduction of something with undesired effects. In both stories, some sort of forbidden object is opened, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the case of Pandora's Box, opening the box leads to the release of all the evils of the world. In the Garden of Eden, the forbidden fruit leads to the expelling of Adam and Eve from the Garden and their eventual death. However, the Garden of Eden also offers some hope in that God promises a savior to restore harmony between heaven and earth.",
