  "output": "A neural network is a computer system modeled on the human brain and nervous system. It consists of a network of neurons connected via synapses, which are constantly exchanging information in the form of electrical signals. These networks have the ability to learn by adjusting connections and assigning weights to inputs in order to predict output based on prior experience. Neural networks are used in a variety of applications such as speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, machine learning, and forecasting.",
