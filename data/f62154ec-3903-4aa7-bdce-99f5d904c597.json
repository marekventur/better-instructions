  "output": "Dear [Friend],\n\nFinding a job can often times be challenging and overwhelming. I want to give you some advice and encouragement to help you succeed. First, it is important to make sure that you are taking the time to research different industries and the qualifications necessary for the positions you are interested in. When you have decided on the best industry fit for your skills and experience, create an effective resume and cover letter that captures the attention of potential employers. Additionally, network with people in your field as often as you can. It is often easier to get a job through personal contacts then through submitting applications.\n\nI am wishing you the best of luck in your job hunt!\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",
