  "output": "Elbow pain can be caused by a number of different conditions, including tendinitis, bursitis, ligament tears, and fractures. It is often the result of repetitive strain or overuse, such as what can happen from sports activities or certain jobs. Injuries can also cause elbow pain, such as sprains, muscle strains, and dislocations. Some medical conditions like arthritis, gout, and diabetes can also lead to elbow pain. Treatment for elbow pain depends on the underlying cause, but may include rest, pain relievers, physical therapy, or surgery.",
