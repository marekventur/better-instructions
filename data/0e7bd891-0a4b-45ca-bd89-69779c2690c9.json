  "input": "",
  "output": "A creative way to teach elementary school students about the water cycle could be to have them create their own water cycle in a jar. The student could fill the jar with water, then add items like small rocks, pebbles, gravel, and sand. They could then freeze a section of the jar to represent evaporation and place it in a warm place to show condensation and precipitation. Finally, they could add drops of food coloring to the jar to demonstrate the movement of water. As a culminating activity, have the student label the different parts of their model water cycle.",
