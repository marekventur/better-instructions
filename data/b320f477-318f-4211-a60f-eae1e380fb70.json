  "input": "",
  "output": "The internet has seen a rapid increase in usage over the past two decades, with more people than ever connected to the web. As broadband connection speeds have increased and the cost of access has gone down, people have been able to both access more content and stay connected to each other more easily than ever before. This has been particularly true of younger generations, who have grown up in an era where the internet is a common and accessible resource. As usage has grown, so has the amount of content available on the web, resulting in a vast online world of information and entertainment accessible with just a few clicks.",
