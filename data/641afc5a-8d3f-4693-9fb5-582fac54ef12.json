  "output": "Little Red Riding Hood was on her way to visit her sick grandmother when she was intercepted by the sly wolf. The wolf asked Red Riding Hood about her plans and then took a shortcut to Grandmothers house. When Red Riding Hood arrived, the wolf had already devoured her grandmother and was pretending to be her. Little Red Riding Hood was skeptical and the wolf's disguise eventually failed, but it was too late. Little Red Riding Hood was saved in the nick of time by a woodcutter and later reunited with her grandmother safe and sound.",
