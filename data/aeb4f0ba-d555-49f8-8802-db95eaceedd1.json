  "output": "The five stages of the consumer decision making process include the problem recognition stage, the information search stage, the evaluation of alternatives stage, the purchase decision stage, and the post-purchase evaluation stage. During the problem recognition stage, the consumer identifies a need and begins searching for information. During the information search, the consumer searches for more information to help them select a product. During the evaluation of alternatives stage, the consumer evaluates their available choices and weighs their options. During the purchase decision stage, the consumer makes a purchase. Finally, during the post-purchase evaluation stage, the consumer evaluates their purchase and decides whether they are satisfied with their decision, or if they need to make another purchase.",
