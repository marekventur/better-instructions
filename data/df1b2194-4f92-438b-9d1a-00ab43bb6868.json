  "input": "",
  "output": "Design thinking is a human-centered approach to problem-solving that encourages creativity and innovation. The core principles of design thinking involve understanding the user and the context, following a creative and iterative process, embracing exploration and collaboration, employing prototyping and testing, and communicating effectively. By understanding the needs and experiences of users, designers can develop creative solutions that would not have been possible with a traditional approach. By following an iterative process, users can refine and perfect their solutions over time. By exploring different perspectives and collaborating with different stakeholders, designers can come up with more well-rounded solutions. Prototyping and testing are essential for verifying the usability and desirability of a solution. Finally, effective communication is essential for ensuring that different stakeholders are in agreement on the solution and that there is understanding and support throughout the design process.",
