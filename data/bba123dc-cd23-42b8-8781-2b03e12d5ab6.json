Place the potatoes in a large bowl and add in two tablespoons of olive oil. Gently mix the potatoes with the oil, making sure that all the cubes are evenly covered with oil. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Peel and mince the garlic, then sprinkle it over the potatoes. Place the potatoes in the oven and bake for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, wash and cut the broccoli into small florets. When the potatoes are done, add the broccoli to the baking sheet and bake for another 20 minutes. Once finished, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Sprinkle the potatoes and broccoli with some salt and freshly chopped parsley, and serve.",
