  "input": "",
  "output": "Bacteria can cause sickness in humans by entering the body and causing an infection. Bacteria can enter the body through ingestion, inhalation, contact with an infected surface, or contact with another infected person. Once the bacteria enters the body, it can multiply, leading to an infection. Symptoms of bacterial infections can include fever, swelling, confusion, rash, joint pain, and tiredness. If not treated, the infection can become more severe and lead to complications.",
