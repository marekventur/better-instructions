  "instruction": "Provide an example of how Airbnb encourages people to travel differently.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Airbnb encourages people to travel differently by enabling travelers to live in unique accommodations, such as one-of-a-kind homes, apartments, and even treehouses. This makes it easier for travelers to immerse themselves in the local culture, explore lesser-known places, and eat local dishes. Additionally, Airbnb encourages its hosts to provide unique experiences that can further enrich travelers' experiences, such as tours, experiences, classes, events, and activities.",
