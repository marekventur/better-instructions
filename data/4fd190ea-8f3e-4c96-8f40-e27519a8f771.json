  "input": "",
  "output": "The Bernoulli Distribution is a discrete probability distribution used to model a situation in which there are only two possible outcomes. It is commonly used in the field of statistics and applied to a wide range of problems. For example, it can be used to model the probability of success in a medical trial by finding the probability of a patient being cured. It can also be used in finance to model the probability of a stock market crash or gain in a given period of time. Additionally, it can be used for predicting customer loyalty, predicting online clicks, and modeling coin flips.",
