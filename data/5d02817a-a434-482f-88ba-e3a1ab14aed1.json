  "output": "Wind erosion is the process by which wind transports soil or sediment and redeposits it in another location. Wind erosion primarily occurs when the ground is dry, since wind can carry sediment more easily when there is no moisture to keep the particles close to the ground. It occurs due to winds at different speeds and varying in stability. It results in far-reaching formations such as sand dunes, deflating of soil, and depositing of river sediments to higher elevations.",
