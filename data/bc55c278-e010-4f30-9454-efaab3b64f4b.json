  "output": "Fitness typically consists of four components: cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and body composition. Cardiovascular endurance improves the health of the heart, lungs, and circulatory system and can be improved with activities like running, swimming, cycling, and cardio classes. Muscular strength and endurance are developed by performing activities that work against resistance, such as weight training, and improving flexibility can be achieved with stretching and yoga. Lastly, body composition is a measure of the amount of body fat relative to muscle mass, and a healthy body composition can be accomplished by reducing processed foods, engaging in regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.",
