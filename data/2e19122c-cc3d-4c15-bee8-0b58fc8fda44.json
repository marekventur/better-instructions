  "instruction": "Suppose you have a dataset with 30 attributes. Select the feature selection method you will use to select the best subset of attributes.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A suitable feature selection method to select a subset of attributes from a dataset with 30 attributes would be a wrapper method, such as recursive feature elimination (RFE) or sequential feature selection (SFS). In RFE, a subset of attributes are selected and evaluated by a predictive model. The subset of attributes with the highest model accuracy are retained and used for predicting. In SFS, a subset of features are selected by evaluating each attribute's contribution to the model accuracy and adding the most important attribute each time to the current subset.",
