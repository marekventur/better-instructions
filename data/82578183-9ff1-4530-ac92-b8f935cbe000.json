  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to make voice assistant applications more accurate, so they can better understand a user\u2019s spoken language. It is used to interpret natural language commands and extract information from raw text. NLP is used to break down user queries into components like syntax, semantics, and intents. It is also used to recognize entities, detect sentiment, recognize user intent, and generate responses. By using NLP, voice assistant applications are able to recognize and understand natural language queries, as well as generate responses in a form that reflects the user\u2019s understanding.",
