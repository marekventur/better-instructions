  "output": "Once upon a time, there were two cute and cuddly animals - a fox and a rabbit. They were very different, with the fox being fast and agile, while the rabbit was slow and shy. Despite the differences, the two were drawn together; the fox's energy and spontaneity were enough to bring the shy rabbit out of its shell. They quickly developed an unbreakable friendship, spending more and more time together, playing and exploring the wild. Whenever they were separated, they couldn\u2019t wait to reunite, as if nothing had ever changed.",
