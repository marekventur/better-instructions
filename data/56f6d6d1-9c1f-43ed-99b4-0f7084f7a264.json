  "input": "",
  "output": "A human needs to breathe oxygen because it is the primary source of energy for our cells. Oxygen enters the body and helps to convert the food we eat into energy, which is then used to power our bodies. Without oxygen, our cells wouldn't have the energy they need to function properly, and as a result, we wouldn't be able to survive.",
