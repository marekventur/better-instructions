  "output": "A bus driver is going on his route and he needs to pick up 3 passengers. Unfortunately, all 3 of them gave him different directions on the same road. The first one said he needs to turn left, the second one said he needs to turn right, and the third one said he needs to turn around. Given this information, which direction should the bus driver take?\n\nThe bus driver should turn left. This is because the third passenger's statement of turning around actually means that the bus driver needs to go back in the same direction he was originally headed in. This direction is to the left.",
