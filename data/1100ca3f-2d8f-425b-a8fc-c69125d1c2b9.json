  "output": "I recently read the poem \"Love\" by John Donne. Donne masterfully crafts the poem to create a vivid image of love in all its complexities. The poem beautifully conveys how love can be both a joy and a pain. However, I feel that the emotions and descriptions of love could be fleshed out further to create a more lasting impact.",
