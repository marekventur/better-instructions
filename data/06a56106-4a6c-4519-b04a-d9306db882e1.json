  "output": "The moon goes through a repeating cycle of phases known as the lunar cycle. It begins with the New Moon, when the moon is invisible in the night sky, and ends with the Full Moon, when the moon is completely illuminated. In between are the waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, and waning gibbous phases. After Full Moon, we enter the waning gibbous phase, followed by the third quarter, waning crescent, and back to New Moon. It takes about 29.5 days for the moon to go through the entire cycle.",
