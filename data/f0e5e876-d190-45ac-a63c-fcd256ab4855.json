  "output": "Michael was a retired boxer in his mid-forties. He had a burly, grizzled frame, with a broad chest and large fists. Despite his massive size, he was surprisingly agile. He had a gruff demeanor and never hesitated to speak his mind, but he was surprisingly gentle and kind when interacting with people. He had a deep respect for the sport of boxing, and a wealth of knowledge to pass down to the younger generations.",
