For the soup, try a vegetable broth-based soup with loads of vegetables. For the protein, opt for fish, grilled chicken, or a tofu stir-fry. For the vegetable side dish, include roasted veggies or steamed greens. To complete the meal, offer healthy alternatives to typical condiments and desserts, such as Greek yogurt or an herbal tea.",
