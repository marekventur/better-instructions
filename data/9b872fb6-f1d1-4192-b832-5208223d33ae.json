  "input": "",
  "output": "A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software implementation of a physical computer. It allows users to run multiple operating systems and applications within a single environment, each with its own virtualized set of resources and software. Virtual Machines provide a secure and isolated platform on which to operate, allowing users to create complex architectures without compromising the host system. In addition, they can be used to simulate hardware configurations, network infrastructures, and software environments for testing and development purposes.",
