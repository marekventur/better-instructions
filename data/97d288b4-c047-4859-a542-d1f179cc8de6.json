  "output": "The process for making potato salad starts by boiling the potatoes until they are tender. Once they are cooked, drain the water and let the potatoes cool. Next, peel and dice the potatoes into small cubes and place them in a large bowl. To the bowl, add in diced celery, chopped onions, diced pickles, mayonnaise or Greek yogurt, mustard, salt and pepper, and mix all the ingredients together. Then, chill the salad for at least 2 hours before serving.",
