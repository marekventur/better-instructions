  "input": "",
  "output": "The best way to win at tic-tac-toe is to create a plan. First, try to get three in a row, either diagonally, horizontally, or vertically. Next, block your opponent's moves by putting your piece in a position that forces them to block you. In addition, if you cannot get three in a row, try creating two in a row possible and blocking the third. Finally, it is important to know when to force a draw by preventing your opponent from gaining three in a row.",
