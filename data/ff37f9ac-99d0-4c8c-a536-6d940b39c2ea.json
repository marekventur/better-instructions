  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Language models are not easily transferable and must be re-trained when deployed in a new context.\n2. Language models can be prone to overfitting and struggle to generalize on out-of-distribution data.\n3. The quality of the output of a language model is dependent on the training data, which is often limited and may not reflect the target language.\n4. Language models are dependent on computing power and can be slow to train and be used for inference.\n5. The performance of language models can be uncertain and can be difficult to evaluate.\n6. Language models are prone to producing unexpected results when used in contexts that have not been taken into consideration during training.",
