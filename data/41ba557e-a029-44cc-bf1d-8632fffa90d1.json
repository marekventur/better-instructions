  "output": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the US economy. The unemployment rate shot up to 14.7% in April 2020, a level not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Many small businesses closed as people stopped spending, resulting in a sharp decline in economic growth. Millions of people lost their jobs and had to rely on government aid to survive. The pandemic has highlighted how unchecked it can cause severe economic damage and has changed the way the world looks at global health and its impacts on the economy.",
