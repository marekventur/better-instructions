  "instruction": "Construct plumbing diagrams for a two-story house",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A typical two-story house requires a plumbing diagram which consists of two main components: a main valve system and branch lines running off the main valve system. On the main valve system, the water supply should stem from the municipally provided connection. The branch lines should lead to the fixtures (bathtub, sink, shower, etc.) installed in the two-story house. The branch lines may require T-splitters to regulate the flow and allow for multiple fixtures to be connected. Additionally, the drains should be connected to a single main drain line outlet leading to the septic tank or municipal sewage system.",
