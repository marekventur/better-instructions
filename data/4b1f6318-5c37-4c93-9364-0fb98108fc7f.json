  "output": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning networks that are commonly used in computer vision tasks. They are designed to process input data that has a spatial structure, such as images or videos. CNNs are composed of an input layer, multiple convolution layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers and an output layer. These layers work together to extract meaningful features from the input data, and then use those features to make a prediction.",
