  "input": "",
  "output": "A telephone is a basic device limited to making and receiving calls and sending messages. A smartphone, on the other hand, is a multifaceted device capable of performing a wide range of basic tasks such as making and receiving calls, messaging, and web browsing, as well as more advanced activities such as data analysis, navigation, and playing games. Smartphones also offer the advantage of being able to download new apps, allowing users more control over the device's capabilities.",
