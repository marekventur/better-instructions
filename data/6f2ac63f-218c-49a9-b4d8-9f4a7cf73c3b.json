  "input": "Approach1: Applying mathematical combinations\nApproach2: Using machine-learning algorithms",
  "output": "Applying mathematical combinations allows for easily decipherable and explainable results but requires substantial manual effort. Conversely, using machine learning algorithms generally can yield highly-accurate results and can automate a lot of the computation, but the underlying processes can be opaque and difficult to understand.",
