  "output": "Genetics plays a key role in the development of an organism, from conception through birth and into adulthood. Genes provide instructions for the production of proteins that drive the processes necessary for the development of the organism. This includes everything from determining the sex of an organism to controlling the size and shape of its organs and body parts. Genetic variation is also essential for an organism's ability to adapt to its environment and evolve.",
