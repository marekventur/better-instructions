  "input": "Text 1: He was walking on the streets. \nText 2: He was running on the streets.",
  "output": "The two texts compare two different modes of travel: walking and running. In the first text, the subject is walking, which is a slower, more leisurely form of transport. In the second text, the subject is running, which is a faster and more energetic form of transport. This suggests that the subject is in a hurry to reach his destination. The two texts therefore provide a contrast between leisurely travel and hurried travel.",
