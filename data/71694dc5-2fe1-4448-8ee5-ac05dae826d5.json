  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to detect cyber crime by applying predictive analytics and computer vision to vast pools of data. AI algorithms can be used to identify malicious activity and detect anomalous behavior, as well as study past attack patterns to identify vulnerabilities and mitigate potential threats. AI can also be used to recognize aberrant user behavior, detect sophisticated malicious code, and alert administrators when suspicious activity is detected. By combining AI, machine learning, and natural language processing, it is possible to detect advanced cyber threats in real-time and automate the response to mitigate them.",
