  "output": "Consider a situation in which a 1 kg object is placed on a wooden table. Initially the object is at rest. If the object is given a force of 10 N then it will accelerate to the right. This acceleration will cause the object to push on the table with a force of 10 N in the opposite direction. Therefore, according to Newton's Third Law, the force exerted by the object on the table is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force of the table on the object.",
