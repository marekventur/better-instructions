  "input": "The Impact of Social Media on Youth",
  "output": "The use of social media by youth has grown exponentially in recent years, with significant implications for the psychological and sociological development of young people. Research shows that excess social media use can lead to various mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, as well as an increased risk of cyberbullying, a lack of digital literacy, and a decrease in social skills. Despite these risks and drawbacks, social media can also serve as a platform for youth to voice their opinion and connect with others in meaningful ways. Policy makers and social media companies must work together to ensure young people are provided with the necessary guidance and support to use this technology safely and responsibly.",
