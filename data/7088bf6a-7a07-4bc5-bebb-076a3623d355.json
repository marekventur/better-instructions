  "input": "",
  "output": "The biggest disadvantage of using a GPT language model is that it does not understand context and can easily generate incorrect outputs if the input is not correct and properly framed. Additionally, GPT language models can generate text which can be grammatically correct but have no substance. The output can also be incoherent or misinformative, which can lead to miscommunication or mislead the users.  Finally, GPT language models are data-hungry, requiring vast amounts of data to produce good results. This can be costly, as well as time-consuming.",
