  "input": "",
  "output": "Search engines play an important role in information retrieval by providing users with quick, accurate results for their queries. Search engines use algorithms to crawl the web and index web pages, so that when a query is entered, the search engine can return a list of webpages containing relevant information. Additionally, search engines use a variety of methods to rank results, such as by relevance and popularity, so that the most relevant and popular results are returned first.",
