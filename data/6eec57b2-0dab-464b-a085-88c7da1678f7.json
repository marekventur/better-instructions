  "output": "One strategy for getting a better understanding of the customer base is to conduct customer surveys. Surveys allow customers to provide information such as demographic data, purchasing preferences, and usage trends. Surveys can be conducted through a variety of mediums, including email, online surveys, in-person surveys, postcards, and phone calls. Additionally, companies can use customer feedback from online forums, reviews, and customer service channels to gain insights about their customers. Analyzing this data can provide valuable insights into customer preferences and help guide marketing and product decisions.",
