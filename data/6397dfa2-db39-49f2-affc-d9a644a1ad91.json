  "instruction": "Design a user interface for a platform of your choice.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The user interface should be intuitive and tailored to the platform's purpose. To make navigation easier for users, the interface should feature a clear, simple layout with prominent navigation elements. There should be multiple search options for users to easily find information, as well as a filtering system for content. Large visual elements, such as images and colors, should be used to draw user attention and guide them through different tasks. The interface should have a responsive design that works on different devices.",
