  "instruction": "Propose a solution to reduce plastic waste in our oceans.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A solution to reduce plastic waste in our oceans is to create public policies that target plastic production and waste management. Governments could create incentives for companies to reduce their use of plastic packaging, such as offering subsidies for eco-friendly packaging materials. Tax breaks could also be offered to businesses that switch to paper or non-plastic-based packaging. Furthermore, steps could be taken to increase public awareness of the environmental harm caused by plastic waste. Additionally, better waste management systems could be implemented to increase the rate of plastic recycling.",
