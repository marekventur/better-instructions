  "instruction": "Describe how a particular group of people is treated in a particular context.",
  "input": "The context: American high schools\nThe group of people: LGBTQ+ students",
  "output": "LGBTQ+ students in American high schools are often the victims of discrimination and unfair treatment. They are often excluded from school activities and social events, and face ridicule and negative attitudes from peers, faculty, and even administrators. Unfortunately, many school policies do not provide enough protection for LGBTQ+ students and their rights are often violated. LGBTQ+ students in American high schools deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and to feel safe and included in their schools.",
