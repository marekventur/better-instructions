  "output": "Both plants and humans require water, food, and sunlight for survival. However, plants can photosynthesize and create energy from sunlight, while humans rely on food for energy. Plants are rooted to their specific location, while humans can roam freely and explore their environment. Plants grow as more resources become available to them, while humans need education and experience to develop their skills and grow as an individual.",
