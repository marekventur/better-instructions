  "input": "",
  "output": "Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more common or less common in a population over time. This is due to the fact that the individuals with certain traits are more successful at surviving and reproducing than those without those traits. For example, some birds have a mutation in their genes that gives them longer beaks, which allows them to reach further into flowers to get their food. Those birds with longer beaks are more successful at surviving, so their traits become more common in the next generation.",
