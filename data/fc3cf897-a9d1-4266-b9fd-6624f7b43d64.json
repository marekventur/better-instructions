  "input": "",
  "output": "Web development and website design are two distinct but related fields. Website design involves creating a visual user interface for a website, including color schemes, fonts, layout, and other design elements. Web development, on the other hand, involves the coding and programming of a website, including coding the backend system, creating databases and databases queries, writing API integrations, and developing custom applications. Both web development and website design are essential to creating a functional, visually appealing website, but they require different skills and expertise.",
