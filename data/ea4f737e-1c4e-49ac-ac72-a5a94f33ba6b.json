  "output": "John was a software engineer and had been coding for the past 5 years. Every day he woke up early to tackle the day ahead. He would start off with a quick breakfast before diving into the world of coding, creating new projects and fixing existing bugs. After a few hours of coding, he would take a break and eat lunch at his desk, discussing new ideas with his colleagues and brainstorming solutions to any tricky problems they had encountered. Afternoon would roll in and John was focussed on his code, powering through the most complex issues while keeping a sharp eye out for potential improvements. His day would finish with a bit of light reading, studying new coding languages, to ensure he was up to date with the latest industry advancements. And with that, his day was complete.",
