Every episode revolves around the four characters, who share a humble apartment with a TV, sofa and table. Ralph's blustery, harebrained schemes are always getting him into trouble, while Alice is always there to provide the voice of reason. Together they bring their unique brand of humor and wit, making The Honeymooners the perfect classic family comedy.",
