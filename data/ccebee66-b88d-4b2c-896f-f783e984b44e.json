  "input": "",
  "output": "A chatbot would be better than a human customer service representative in scenarios where the customer's query is very simple and repetitive, such as in user onboarding, FAQs, and troubleshooting. Chatbots can quickly and accurately process these types of requests, which would be a more efficient use of the customer service representative's time and energy.",
