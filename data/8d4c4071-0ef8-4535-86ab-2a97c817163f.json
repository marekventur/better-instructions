  "instruction": "Construct an argument for why people should adopt plant-based diets",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Adopting a plant-based diet is beneficial for a multitude of reasons. First, a plant-based diet has been proven to reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes, coronary heart disease, and certain cancers. Additionally, a plant-based diet requires fewer resources from the environment such as water, land, and organic waste. Eating plant-based foods can also help reduce one's carbon footprint, as animal-based proteins emit higher levels of methane gas, resulting in a greater greenhouse gas effect. Finally, plant-based foods are usually natural, cheaper, and lower in calories than animal-based foods, meaning a plant-based diet could potentially lead to better long-term health and financial well-being.",
