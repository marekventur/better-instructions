  "output": "Video games should be treated like any other form of art. Just as a painting or a sculpture can shape and provoke emotions, so can a video game. Video games allow us to think, feel, and interact with our environment in ways that no other medium can and deserve to be respected as a form of art. \n\nVideo games create immersive experiences and give players the freedom to explore and make choices in a virtual world. By engaging in these experiences, players can process difficult aspects of their lives and work through them in a safe and controlled environment. This can help players develop their emotional intelligence and understanding of human relationships in a way that no other form of art can offer.\n\nVideo games have had a massive influence in shaping popular culture and have made a profound impact on society. It has been argued that video games have become even more influential than classic art forms like painting, sculpture and theatre in terms of their reach, engagement and impact. Just as classic art forms are fundamental for understanding culture and its values, video games are an important form of expression that can allow us to take a step back and reflect on our lives and the world we live in.\n\nVideo games should be treated like any other form of art and not be seen as a purely recreational activity\u2014they are so much more than that. Whether it\u2019s providing a platform for creative expression, helping to develop empathy and emotional intelligence, or just allowing players to relax and have some fun, video games offer something that no other form of art can.",
