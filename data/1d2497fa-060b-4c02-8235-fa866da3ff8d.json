  "output": "Neural networks are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) which are trained using a type of machine learning, typically using large datasets of labeled training examples. The nodes process input data, passing information to each other, with each node acting like the weighted sum of its inputs, performing a type of \"calculation\" and ultimately producing an output - typically a classification. Neural networks are able to learn complex patterns in large datasets and can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as vision recognition, speech recognition or natural language processing.",
