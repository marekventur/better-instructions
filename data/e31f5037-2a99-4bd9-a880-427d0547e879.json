  "input": "",
  "output": "The use of internet-connected devices presents a variety of security risks. Firstly, these devices can be vulnerable to malicious cyber-attacks, as cybercriminals can exploit their weak security measures to gain access to private data. Additionally, these devices can be used to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and spam campaigns. Moreover, these devices can be used to intercept encrypted data, allowing criminals to gain access to sensitive information. Finally, internet-connected devices can be used to control larger networks, allowing criminals to take control of entire systems.",
