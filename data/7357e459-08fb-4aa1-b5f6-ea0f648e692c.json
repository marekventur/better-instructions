  "output": "John had been warned about the monster that lived in the depths of the forest near his house. He had heard stories that it was huge and powerful, with a skin made up of rocks and razor-sharp claws. But John was brave and determined, and set out to find the monster and prove his courage.\n\nHe traveled deep into the forest, and eventually came to a small clearing. There stood the monster, ready to confront him. John ran at the monster and fought with all his might. He sliced at its rocky hide with his sword, while dodging its claws and teeth with lightning speed. Despite the monster's great strength and power, John managed to hold his own.\n\nFinally, with one mighty swing, John brought his sword down on the monster and gave a great cry of triumph. He had defeated the beast and in that moment, he felt prouder than he had ever before. He had faced a great challenge and overcome it. He had proven himself.",
