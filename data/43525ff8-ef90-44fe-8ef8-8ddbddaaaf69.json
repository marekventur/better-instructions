  "output": "The best solution would be to prioritize schoolwork and extracurricular activities. I would make a schedule that allocates enough time for studying and completing school assignments, as well as participating in extracurricular activities and any other commitments. I would also plan in breaks throughout the day to take care of myself mentally and physically. Lastly, I would make sure to ask for help when needed and try to create a supportive environment by staying organized, motivated, and honest with myself and my commitments.",
