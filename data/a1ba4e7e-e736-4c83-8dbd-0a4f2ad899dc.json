  "input": "",
  "output": "The sky is blue because of the way that light interacts with particles in the atmosphere. When white light from the sun passes through the air, it is scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of nitrogen and oxygen. The blue light is scattered more than the other colors in the spectrum, which is why the sky looks blue.",
