  "output": "An effective system for keeping track of progress includes setting up a calendar with deadlines and milestones. Track progress by recording and analyzing the completion of tasks, setting reminders for yourself and using resources such as to-do list apps. Create a detailed plan for each task and break these tasks into smaller subtasks with realistic goals. Also, give yourself rewards for completing tasks and celebrate the progress you make along the way.",
