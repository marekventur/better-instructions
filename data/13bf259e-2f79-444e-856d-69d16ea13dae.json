  "input": "",
  "output": "A GPT language model is a type of machine learning system that produces human-like natural language generation. It uses a set of algorithms to generate texts that are believable, coherent and accurate with minimal manual effort. GPT language models use a variety of techniques such as artificial neural networks, natural language processing and reinforcement learning to generate a text that is linguistically and grammatically correct. The goal is to automate the process of creating text that is meaningful, readable and engaging.",
