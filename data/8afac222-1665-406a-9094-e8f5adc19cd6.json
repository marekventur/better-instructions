  "output": "Google's Three Laws of Robotics are designed to ensure that robots and AI behave safely and ethically. The laws are modeled on Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, which state that: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; 2) A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; and 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. Google's Three Laws are slightly different and state that: 1) A robot must not cause harm to, or through inaction allow harm to, humans; 2) A robot must obey appropriate humans, unless such orders conflict with the First Law; and 3) A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.  Collectively, these laws are meant to ensure that robots and AI are used safely and ethically, without harming humans or disobeying orders from appropriate people.",
