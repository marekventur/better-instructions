  "input": "",
  "output": "Money itself does not bring lasting happiness because it can't buy things like strong relationships, good health, meaning, purpose, and internal peace of mind. Money is a tool and can be used to buy some comforts and conveniences, but it is not a source of fulfilment or lasting joy. The joy and happiness we seek lies in the moments we can spend with loved ones, the experiences we have with the people that matter to us, the activities we enjoy, and in the feelings of contentment, accomplishment, and satisfaction that come from pursuing our passions and purpose.",
