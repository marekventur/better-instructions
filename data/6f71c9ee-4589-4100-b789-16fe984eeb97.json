  "output": "The article \"Afghanistan and the Doctrine of Armed Humanitarian Intervention\" examines the legal and ethical implications of the use of armed force for humanitarian purposes. It points out that the international community has long wrestled with the ethical concerns raised by using military force for humanitarian purposes, but there is no universally accepted legal framework for armed humanitarian interventions.
