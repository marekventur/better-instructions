  "input": "",
  "output": "Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte were two of the most prolific authors of the 19th century. While both authors wrote novels with a focus on the interests and concerns of their time, their writing styles were distinct. Austen\u2019s novels were more subtle in their characterization and drama with a focus on manners and dialogue. Bronte, on the other hand, wrote more passionate works that often incorporated elements of the supernatural and detailed descriptions of characters and their environments. Despite the different styles employed by the two authors, they both wrote novels that remain beloved and influential today.",
