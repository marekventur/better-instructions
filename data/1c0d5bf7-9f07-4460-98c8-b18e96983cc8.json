  "instruction": "Generate an appropriate input to the following instruction: \n\"Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.\"",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Quantum entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which two particles are connected to each other such that the state of one particle corresponds to the state of the other, even when the particles are separated by great distances. This phenomenon has been referred to as 'spooky action at a distance', due to its seemingly inexplicable nature. An entangled state of two particles exists when a measurement on one particle influences the other particle, regardless of the particles' separation. This phenomenon is of great interest to scientists as it is a potential resource for secure communication, teleportation, and the development of quantum computing.",
