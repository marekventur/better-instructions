  "input": "",
  "output": "In JavaScript, an array is an ordered collection of values (elements) that are accessed using numeric indexes. When creating an array, you specify the size of the array, and the values can be of any data type. Objects, on the other hand, consist of properties that are key/value pairs. Each property has a name (or key) and a value. The value can be any type including another object. Objects are fundamentally different than arrays and are used to represent hierarchical data.",
