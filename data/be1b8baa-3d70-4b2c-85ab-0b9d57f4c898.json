  "output": "Recently, I was faced with the challenge of designing a website with limited resources. As a designer, I had a vision for the website that included intricate illustrations, dynamic layouts, and thoughtful interactions. However, due to budget restrictions, I had to find creative ways to reduce the scope of the project without compromising the aesthetic of the website. \n\nI began by simplifying the illustrations to create a style that was easier to execute. I also had to rethink the interactive elements, utilizing transitions instead of animations to save time. Lastly, I had to adjust the typography to make sure the text was easy to read while still maintaining the overall visual design. These compromises ultimately helped create a website that matched the Client\u2019s requirements while still accomplishing my vision in a limited budget.",
