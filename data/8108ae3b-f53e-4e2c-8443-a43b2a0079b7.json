He prized civil disobedience as a form of power, believing that it could bring about far-reaching social and political reform without bloodshed. He rejected violence, imperialism, and colonialism and was strongly opposed to the presence of the British in India. He also advocated for economic self-sufficiency and saw religious unity and harmony as necessary for Indian independence. He was in favor of equality and human rights, advocating for the rights of women, labourers, and minorities. He opposed all forms of discrimination, including the caste system. He also strived for religious and social freedom, advocating for economic self-sufficiency and environmental stewardship. Overall, Gandhi's political views were characterized by peace, nonviolence, equality, and social and religious freedom.",
