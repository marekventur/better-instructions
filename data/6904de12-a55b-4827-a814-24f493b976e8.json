  "input": "",
  "output": "Newton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied to it, and inversely proportional to its mass. It can be expressed mathematically as F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration of the object. The law states that the more force is applied to an object, the greater its acceleration will be, but this acceleration will be inversely proportional to the mass of the object. This means that the same force applied to two objects with different masses will result in different accelerations.",
