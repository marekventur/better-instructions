Here are some steps you can take to develop a comprehensive research strategy for your next essay.\n\n1. First, you need to get a good understanding of the essay topic. Make sure you understand the prompt and the main argument you want to make in the essay.\n\n2. Make a list of relevant keywords and phrases. This will help you with searching for sources.\n\n3. Find at least three primary sources, such as articles, books, and interviews. Make sure to look for reliable and up-to-date sources and always cite them in your paper.\n\n4. Take notes on what you read and go through each source to understand the context and any applicable points.\n\n5. Use your notes to decide on the main points and evidence you'll use in your essay.\n\n6. Check your facts and arguments against other secondary sources to ensure accuracy and precision. \n\n7. If you have time, you can also look for more sources to expand on the points you've already made.\n\nThese steps can help you create a well-researched essay that accurately supports your argument.",
