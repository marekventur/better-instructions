  "input": "",
  "output": "Increasing biodiversity in an ecosystem can be achieved through various strategies. Introducing native species that are adapted to local conditions can increase diversity. Planting native species in a diverse array of habitats can also create more habitat for different species. Protecting existing habitats and establishing wildlife corridors can provide more space for different organisms to move and interact. Additionally, reintroducing species that have gone locally extinct can help to restore an ecosystem\u2019s biodiversity.  Finally, reducing human impacts, like pollution and climate change, can help to maintain healthy, diverse ecosystems.",
