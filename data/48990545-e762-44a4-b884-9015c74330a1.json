  "input": "",
  "output": "Wild animals should not be kept as pets because they are not domesticated and may pose safety risks to their owners and the public. Keeping wild animals as pets can deplete wild populations, and these animals often have specialized needs that are difficult to meet in captivity. Furthermore, it is generally illegal to keep certain wild animals as pets due to conservation and animal welfare regulations.",
