  "instruction": "Describe the negative impacts of using plastic bags.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One of the biggest negative impacts of using plastic bags is environmental pollution. Plastic bags are non-biodegradable, which means they take hundreds of years to break down and they release toxins and greenhouse gases into the environment. Furthermore, plastic bags can clog waterways and cause flooding in coastal regions. Plastic bags are also a global health hazard, as they often contain chemicals which can leach into food, potentially causing harm to the people consuming it. Finally, plastic bags take up a large amount of space in landfills and are often mistaken for food by wildlife, leading to a risk of injury or death.",
