  "input": "",
  "output": "Entropy is a measure of disorder in a system. It is a measure of the amount of energy that is unavailable to do work. Reversibility is the ability of a system to return to its original state after it has undergone some change. A reversible system is one in which the entropy of the system can be completely restored to its original state after undergoing a change. Entropy and reversibility are related in that a system with a lower entropy is more likely to be reversible.",
