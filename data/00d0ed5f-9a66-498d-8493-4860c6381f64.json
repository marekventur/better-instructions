  "output": "The scientific term for the phenomenon of water turning into ice is known as freezing. This is a physical process that occurs when the temperature of the water drops below zero degrees Celsius. During this process, the water molecules lose energy, which causes them to slow down and stop moving. The molecules then become more organized, forming a lattice structure. This lattice structure is what forms the frozen state of water, which is known as ice.",
