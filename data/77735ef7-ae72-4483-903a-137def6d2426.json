  "instruction": "Compile a list of five major problems that cause climate change.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The five major problems that cause climate change are burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, industrial agriculture, animal agriculture, and air pollution. Burning fossil fuels releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and leading to global warming. Deforestation destroys habitats and reduces the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed, leading to greenhouse gas build-up. Industrial and animal agriculture are responsible for releasing large amounts of methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. Lastly, air pollution, often caused by burning fossil fuels, introduces other pollutants into the atmosphere that also contribute to climate change.",
