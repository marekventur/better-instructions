  "output": "A wavefunction is a mathematical expression that describes the behavior of a wave. It can be used to analyze the wave's properties at all points in space, such as its amplitude, frequency, and phase. On the other hand, a wave packet is a waveform made up of multiple wavefunctions. It is a localized waveform that moves as a single unit, and its size and shape determine how it interacts with its surroundings. Wave packets can represent both light and matter waves.",
