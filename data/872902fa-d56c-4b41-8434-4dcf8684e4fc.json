  "instruction": "Analyze the given ethical dilemma and explain the potential consequences of each available decision.",
  "input": "You are the manager of a fast food restaurant and there is an infestation of mice in the kitchen. Your options are to inform customers, ignore the situation, or lie about the problem.",
  "output": "Informing customers about the mice infestation would be the most ethical choice, as customers should know the health risks associated with dining at the restaurant. However, this could potentially lead to a significant decrease in customers, as well as negative public perception of the business. \nIgnoring the mice infestation would not be ethical, as customers would be unaware of the potential health risks associated with the restaurant. It could also result in serious health code violations if the infestation is not addressed. \nLying about the mice infestation would not be ethical, as customers would be expecting the restaurant to act in an honest and transparent manner. It could also result in serious legal repercussions and negative public perception.",
