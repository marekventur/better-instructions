The main image is an abstract representation of a guitar player in a traditional blues style, featuring details such as the guitar strings, fretboard, playing hand and other elements that evoke the blues culture. The title is written in black, with the words \"Blues Festival\" written in a light blue, to draw attention to the theme. Around the central image lie a few more details such as the name of the main artist, the dates of the festival and the place where it will take place.",
