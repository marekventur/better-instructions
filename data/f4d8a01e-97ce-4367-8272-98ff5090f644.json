  "instruction": "Answer the following question: Why is the Sun so hot?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The Sun is so hot because it is a giant ball of gas that is constantly undergoing a process of nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is a process in which two hydrogen atoms fuse together to form a helium atom, releasing vast amounts of energy in the process. This energy is the heat and light that we experience from the Sun. This process has been occurring for billions of years, and will continue to do so for billions of years to come. That is why the Sun is so hot.",
