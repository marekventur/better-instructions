  "output": "Alice and Bob were walking through a forest late at night when they stumbled upon a hidden entrance. With curiosity, they decided to explore the area and eventually found an old castle. As they explored the castle, they began to notice strange shadows by their feet and soon realized they were being followed by a herd of talking unicorns. \n\nThe unicorns explained that they had been trapped in the castle for many years, unable to leave since they had been cursed with an unrelenting silence. As Alice and Bob listened, they began to feel an affinity for the creatures and knew they had to help break the curse. Together, they started to look for clues and eventually found an ancient book containing the spell to break the curse. They performed the ritual and the unicorns were able to speak once again. Alice and Bob were relieved, knowing the unicorns could now roam free and explore the world.",
