  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a kingdom high in the mountains ruled by a wise king. The king had two beloved pets - a llama and a lemur. One day, the two animals got into an argument about which one of them had more teeth. When the king heard this, he decided to end the conflict by decreeing that the llama and lemur would have the exact same number of teeth - 42! And so it was, and ever since then, both llamas and lemurs have had 42 teeth.",
