  "output": "A central processing unit (CPU) is a component of a computer system responsible for executing instructions and carrying out a sequence of calculations. It is the brain of the computer, performing math, logic, and control operations for a computer based on a set of instructions provided by a program. The CPU fetches and decodes instructions, then executes them on the data provided by memory. It also stores and retrieves data from memory in order to execute instructions. Finally, it sends the processed data to output devices such as displays or printers.",
