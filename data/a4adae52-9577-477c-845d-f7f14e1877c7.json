  "output": "I once had to work with a group of people to move an entire office of furniture. It was a difficult task since we had to coordinate our schedules and figure out how to move everything safely and quickly. We had to divide up the tasks, with some of us helping to organize the furniture and others helping to lift and move it. We worked together to make sure the job got done and in the end we completed the task in a timely manner. It was a great learning experience as I got to see how working together as a team can help you accomplish a task more efficiently.",
