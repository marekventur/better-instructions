  "input": "",
  "output": "Quantum computing is a form of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. It has the potential to solve problems that classical computers are unable to, such as simulating quantum systems and searching large databases. A quantum computer uses quantum bits, or qubits, to store information instead of the traditional binary bits of classical computers. Qubits have the ability to be in multiple states between 0 and 1, allowing for much greater throughput of information. By utilizing quantum algorithms and principles, quantum computers have the potential to solve complex problems in a fraction of the time that a classical computer would take.",
