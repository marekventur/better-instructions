  "input": "",
  "output": "Three foods that can help with weight loss are lean proteins, fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Lean proteins, such as skinless chicken, eggs, and fish, contain fewer calories and help to build muscle as well as reduce hunger. Fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and are low in calories, helping to keep you full and energized. Whole grains are a great source of fiber and can help to reduce hunger, improve digestion, and keep you feeling full for longer.",
