  "output": "A beginner exercise program should focus on building strength, improving mobility and flexibility, and developing muscular endurance. An effective program for a beginner should include both aerobic and resistance exercises with at least three sessions of 30 minutes each week. \n\nFor strength training, exercises such as squats, push-ups, lunges, and planks can be done with bodyweight. For aerobic exercises, walking, jogging, biking, and swimming can be done. Resistance exercises such as core exercises and light weights can be used to build muscle. \n\nFor flexibility and mobility, include exercises such as yoga, Tai Chi, and stretching. Muscular endurance exercises include hill sprints and high-intensity-interval-training (HIIT). \n\nIt is important to tailor the workouts to the individual and start slowly. Allow time for the body to adjust to the program and begin increasing intensity as strength and endurance improve.",
