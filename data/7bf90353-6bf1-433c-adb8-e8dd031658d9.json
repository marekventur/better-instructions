  "input": "",
  "output": "In \"To a Skylark\" by Percy Bysshe Shelley, literary elements such as metaphor, simile, personification, apostrophe and alliteration are used. The imagery of nature, the vastness of the sky, and the beauty of the skylark are also used as rhetorical devices. Shelley uses the metaphor of a skylark to symbolize an ideal of freedom, as skylarks fly precariously high and free in the sky. Similarly, he uses the simile of a star-like gem to represent his lover's beauty. He also uses personification to make the bird more human, for example describing its joyous singing as a song of gladness. Apostrophe is used when Shelley speaks directly to the bird, and alliteration is used for a poetic effect.Shelley also uses imagery of nature, such as dew, moss and lightning, to evoke a sense of calmness and beauty. He also uses the vastness of the sky to represent a greater power beyond us. Additionally, he uses the beauty of the skylark as a rhetorical device to persuade us of its remarkable nature.",
