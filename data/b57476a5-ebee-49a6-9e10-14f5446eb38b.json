  "output": "The movie Avatar (2009) and Up (2009) are both computer animated films that tell tales of exploration, adventure and courage. Both movies feature characters on a journey and the importance of family, though Avatar focuses on an outsider's interaction within a new world while Up is focused on the inner journey of an elderly man. Avatar is a science fiction epic, full of visually stunning visual effects and a larger-than-life plot \u2013 whereas Up deals with a more human story, of a chance to explore one's deeper potential as a character. Both films capture the audience's attention in different ways, with Avatar providing stunning visuals and scope, whereas Up provides a more character driven approach and a story that conjures up emotions.",
