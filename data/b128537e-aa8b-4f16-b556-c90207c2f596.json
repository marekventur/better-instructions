  "instruction": "Based on the input text, write a persuasive argument supporting the idea that \"textbooks should be available for free\".",
  "input": "Textbooks are often expensive and difficult for students to purchase.",
  "output": "Textbooks should be freely available to students because the cost of textbooks puts an undue burden on students, especially those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The exorbitant cost of textbooks puts numerous students, who may otherwise perform well academically, in a difficult financial situation. The cost of textbooks can range from a few hundred dollars to upwards of a thousand dollars. These prices are extremely excessive, and with this money students could potentially purchase an entire semester's worth of other necessities, such as food or clothing. All students should be given equal opportunities to succeed and learn, regardless of their financial situation, and making textbooks readily accessible would provide a tremendous opportunity to achieve this goal.",
