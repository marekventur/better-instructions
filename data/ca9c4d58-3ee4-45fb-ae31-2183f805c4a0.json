  "input": "",
  "output": "Once upon a time in Hollywood is a brilliant and ambitious film from writer-director Quentin Tarantino. It is a compelling story that weaves together several Hollywood genres from the past and present. The film stars Brad Pitt and Leo DiCaprio who deliver excellent performances as two former television stars who are trying to make it big. The cinematography is stunning, and the soundtrack is perfect for setting the mood of the film. Overall, I highly recommend this film for all lovers of great cinema. It's an exciting, tasteful, and expertly crafted experience that you don't want to miss.",
