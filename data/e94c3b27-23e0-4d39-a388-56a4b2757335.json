  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that supervised learning requires labelled data for training, while unsupervised learning does not. With supervised learning, the goal is to find the relationship between the given data and the labels that are provided. On the other hand, unsupervised learning is focused on finding patterns and relationships in unlabeled data. Additionally, supervised learning provides more controlled results since it relies on the labels or outputs that are already provided, while unsupervised learning results in more potentially unexpected results.",
