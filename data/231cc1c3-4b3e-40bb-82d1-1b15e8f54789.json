  "output": "Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This law is often referred to as the law of action and reaction and states that forces occur in pairs. The presence of one force always results in the presence of a reaction force of equal magnitude, but in the opposite direction. For example, when a person pushes an object away from them, an equal and opposite force is generated, pushing the person back as well.",
