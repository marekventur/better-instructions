  "input": "",
  "output": "Gender roles have changed significantly over the last 50 years. Women are no longer expected to adhere to traditional domestic roles, with more women becoming active in the workforce and pursuing higher education. Men on the other hand, are becoming more involved in the home and are often sharing in tasks traditionally reserved for women. Gender roles are evolving to become more equal, with both men and women having access to the same opportunities.",
