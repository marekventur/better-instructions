  "output": "Plants require 16 essential nutrients to maintain healthy growth and development. The primary nutrients include carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, which are absorbed from the atmosphere and converted into carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Other important nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are mostly provided by the soil and help plants to build molecules and drive metabolic processes like photosynthesis. The balance of these nutrients is essential for healthy and vigorous growth.",
