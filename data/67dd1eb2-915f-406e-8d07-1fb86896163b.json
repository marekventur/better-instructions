  "output": "Blockchain technology offers many advantages for online voting. First, it provides immutability, which allows for secure and reliable voting, since no one can change the data stored in a blockchain. Additionally, it offers a distributed system that ensures the results of an election are truly decentralized, with transactions stored on multiple computers around the world. The use of blockchain technology also enables transparent and verifiable results, making the process more secure and trustworthy. Blockchain technology also allows for an individual's vote to remain anonymous, further protecting the integrity of the voting system.",
