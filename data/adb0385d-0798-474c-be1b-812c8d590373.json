  "input": "",
  "output": "Islamic beliefs on fate are that destiny is predestined by Allah, the all-knowing. Muslims believe that everything that happens in the universe, both good and bad, has been written into the Unseen Record by him. They also believe that Allah gave humans both freedom and the power to choose, so humans are responsible for their own actions and must bear their own consequences. Fate can be influenced by humans, as Allah has the power to alter destinies in response to prayers and supplications.",
