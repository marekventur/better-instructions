  "input": "",
  "output": "Scientific theories and scientific laws are both used to explain natural phenomena and make predictions about the future behavior of a system. However, they have different meanings and uses. A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is supported by a body of evidence. It is often formed after testing and retesting with data and is considered valid if the data supports the hypotheses. A scientific law, on the other hand, is a statement that describes a phenomenon that is always true in all cases, regardless of context or time. It is usually framed in the form of an equation and provides a simple, universal explanation for a phenomenon.",
