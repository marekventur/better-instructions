  "output": "The Three Little Pigs is an old children's story about three pigs and their journey to build a home out of different materials in order to protect themselves from the Big Bad Wolf. The first two pigs build houses out of straw and sticks, respectively, and ultimately get blown down by the wolf. The third pig builds his house out of bricks and is able to survive by outsmarting the wolf. In the end, the third pig proves to be more clever and resourceful than the other two, and his brick house stands firm. The story is a cautionary tale that encourages preparation, resourcefulness and hard work in order to be successful.",
