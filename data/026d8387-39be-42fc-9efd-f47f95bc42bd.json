  "input": "",
  "output": "1. Increased safety, as self-driving cars can reduce the probability of human error on the roads.\n2. Improved convenience, as self-driving cars can take you from one place to another without requiring you to drive.\n3. Reduced energy consumption, as self-driving cars are able to optimize the route plan and reduce stop-and-start driving.\n4. Increased mobility for disabled individuals, as self-driving cars can open up many opportunities for those with limited mobility.\n5. Reduced cost of transportation, as self-driving cars can optimize routes and reduce the number of miles driven, resulting in lower costs.",
