  "output": "The movie industry has changed drastically over the last two decades. The rise of streaming services has provided unprecedented access to content, including blockbuster films, indie films, and documentaries. The availability of broadband and digital technologies has allowed consumers to watch movies anytime, anywhere, and on any device. Moreover, the emergence of social media platforms has made it easier for filmmakers to reach much larger audiences through direct marketing and engagement. \n\nThe advent of digital film-making has also transformed the industry. Digital technologies have made it easier to produce films on a lower budget, allowing filmmakers to realize their vision without the same financial restrictions they faced before the emergence of digital production. Furthermore, post-production techniques such as CGI have enabled filmmakers to create more compelling visuals. \n\nFinally, the increasing prevalence of film festivals around the world has made it easier for independent filmmakers to gain exposure and to reach large audiences. This has created a domino effect, inspiring more filmmakers to pursue their creative vision and share it with the world.",
