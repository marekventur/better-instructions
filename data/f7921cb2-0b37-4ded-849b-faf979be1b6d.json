  "output": "Recent years have seen an increased focus on developing renewable sources of energy. Renewable energy is energy from sources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves and geothermal heat. This type of energy harnesses natural processes that are renewable, unlike the more traditional fossil fuels which are in finite supply.\n\nUsing renewable energy sources offers many potential benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing the burden on existing power supply infrastructure. Additionally, it can create jobs in regions that need additional economic opportunities. Renewable sources of energy also provide local access to power, reducing reliance on, and costs associated with, importing fuel. \n\nDespite these potential benefits, challenges still remain when it comes to transitioning to and utilizing renewable energy sources. Many countries are still heavily reliant on traditional fossil fuels, while renewable energy sources account for a small fraction of their energy production. Additionally, renewable energy sources often require higher initial investments, and these costs can be off-putting to some.\n\nNevertheless, despite the barriers that still remain, there is no doubt that renewable energy sources are the future of energy production. With increased focus, attention and investment, the world can transition from its current reliance on fossil fuels to cleaner renewable sources that offer many advantages.",
