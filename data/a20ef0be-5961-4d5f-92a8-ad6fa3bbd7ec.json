  "input": "",
  "output": "Sociolinguistics is a field of linguistics that studies the relationship between language and culture, focusing on language use in different social settings. Discourse analysis, on the other hand, is a field of linguistics that studies language in the context of larger conversations or texts. It looks at how meaning is constructed through language, particularly through the analysis of sequences of utterances and the relationships among the people having a conversation. Both fields are relevant to language studies, with sociolinguistics focusing more on cultural and social aspects, while discourse analysis focusing more on the construction of meaning.",
