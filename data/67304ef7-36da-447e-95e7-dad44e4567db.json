  "output": "A great way to encourage people to exercise is to create a rewards system where people can track their progress and get rewarded for their accomplishments. For example, when someone reaches a certain goal like running for a certain amount of time or walking a certain distance, they can receive a virtual badge or other reward. This reward system will be a great way to get people motivated and keep them focused on achieving their fitness objectives. Other incentives such as free gym classes, discounts on fitness apparel, or gift cards can also be used to encourage people to stay active and work out regularly.",
