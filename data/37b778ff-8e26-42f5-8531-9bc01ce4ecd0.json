  "output": "William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens are two of the most influential writers in English literature. Shakespeare is known for his poetic writing style which uses a lot of figurative language and iambic pentameter. His works often explore complex themes of love, loss, power and loyalty. Dickens, on the other hand, is known for his narrative writing style. His stories often have an element of social criticism, exploring issues like poverty and class disparities. They also explore themes such as morality and justice. Furthermore, Dickens often incorporated elements of the supernatural into his stories, while Shakespeare did not.",
