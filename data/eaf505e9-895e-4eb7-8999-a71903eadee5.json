  "output": "There are several differences in the impacts of air pollution on urban and rural places. In rural areas, air pollution can have a negative effect on human health due to the concentration of fine particles in the air. The health impacts are greater due to inadequate infrastructure such as water systems, transport, energy and healthcare, which are all more limited in rural areas. In contrast, urban areas have more infrastructure to manage air pollution and its effects. Additionally, in urban areas there is a higher population density, so air pollution is more concentrated than in rural areas, leading to further exaggeration of the negative impacts of air pollution. In comparison, rural areas are not as densely populated and the air pollution therefore spreads out over a larger area. \n\nUrban air pollution has also proved to be a problem to the environment, because it is the main cause of climate change in the cities. Air pollution contributes to the health risks associated with urban air quality, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as damage to crops and ecosystems. On the other hand, rural air pollution can be caused by agricultural sources like livestock and burning of fields, which can lead to soil and water contamination and destruction of habitats. Moreover, since rural areas have less industries and generate fewer emissions, the presence of air pollution often indicates that the air quality is bad. Either way, air pollution has a negative impact on both urban and rural places, having negative health, environmental and economic effects.",
