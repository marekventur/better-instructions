  "output": "Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses data patterns and algorithms to enable computers to learn and apply knowledge without explicit programming. It uses data to make predictions, build models, and make decisions. Machine Learning is used in many different fields, from recommendation engines and medical diagnosis to object detection and language processing. It is becoming increasingly important in our society, as it allows us to gain valuable insights from data and use them to make better decisions. With Machine Learning, computers can learn to recognize patterns and improve their accuracy with the more data they are exposed to. This enables us to discover hidden insights, develop smarter automation and build more intelligent systems.",
