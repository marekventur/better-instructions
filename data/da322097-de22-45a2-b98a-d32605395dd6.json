  "input": "",
  "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into food energy. During this process, the plant takes in carbon dioxide from the air and combines it with water to create glucose and oxygen. This glucose is then used to produce energy for the plant and oxygen, which is released into the air. Photosynthesis is important as it provides a major source of food energy for living organisms, and is also responsible for the upkeep of the earth's atmosphere.",
