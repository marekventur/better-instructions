The sound of the waves crashing against the shore filled my ears, and the smell of the salty sea air refreshed me. Looking out on the horizon, I saw deep blue water stretching out for miles. Seagulls flew overhead and I heard people laughing and talking in the distance. I could feel the sand between my toes, and the gentle breeze blowing through my hair. It was an perfect day at the beach, and I was ready to take it in.",
