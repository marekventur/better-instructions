You've definitely got to share the recipe with me.\n\nFriend 2: Of course! I'd be more than happy to. It's actually quite easy to make. You just have to layer all the ingredients, bake it for an hour, and then dinner is ready! \n\nFriend 1: Sounds great! Can't wait to give it a try. \n\nFriend 2: Me neither! Enjoy it while it's hot!",
