  "input": "",
  "output": "The major challenges of using Machine Learning include obtaining high-quality data, developing accurate models, and dealing with complexity, as well as ethical issues such as privacy and fairness. Data quality is especially important for the success of machine learning models - the models must be trained on a large and diverse dataset of sufficient quality in order to produce accurate results. Additionally, complexity and ethical considerations need to be taken into account when developing and deploying machine learning models.",
