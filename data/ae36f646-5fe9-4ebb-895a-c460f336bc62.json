  "instruction": "Describe the differences between acid rain and regular rain.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between acid rain and regular rain is that acid rain has a higher concentration of acid-forming compounds, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, than regular rain. Acid rain is caused by the burning of fossil fuels and other man-made pollutants such as vehicle emissions and factories that release acid gases into the atmosphere, which are then absorbed by water droplets and carried to land via rain, fog, snow, and other forms of precipitation. \n\nRegular rain is naturally occurring rainwater, whereas acid rain is significantly more acidic than regular rain due to its increased presence of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. Thus, acid rain is more harmful to plants and animals, as it can erode their protective coverings and corrode their surfaces. In addition, acid rain can change the pH levels of lakes and streams, causing fish, insects, and other aquatic creatures to be unable to survive. Regular rain, on the other hand, is naturally acidic and is not as harmful to the environment.",
