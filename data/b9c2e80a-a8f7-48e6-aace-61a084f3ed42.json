  "instruction": "Describe the behavior of a rock falling through air.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "When a rock falls through air, it experiences a force of gravity that causes it to accelerate downwards. This acceleration is known as the gravitational acceleration of a falling object, called \"g\", which is 9.8 m/s^2. The rock starts from rest, meaning it has an initial speed of 0 m/s. Thus, its velocity increases with time, meaning the rock will move faster the longer it is in the air. The rock will eventually reach its terminal velocity - the maximum velocity it can reach - which is reached after reaching a certain amount of air resistance. At this point, the rock will continually maintain the same velocity until it hits the ground.",
