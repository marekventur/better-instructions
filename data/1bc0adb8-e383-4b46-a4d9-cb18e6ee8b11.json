These assistants, which rely on natural language processing and machine learning, have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing them to understand a user's intent and provide personalized answers or recommendations. Additionally, AI assistants are becoming increasingly embedded in devices, allowing users to get quick answers to their questions without needing to go through multiple menus or rely on manual inputs.
