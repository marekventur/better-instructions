  "output": "One interesting technique for memorizing new information is known as the 'chunking' method. This involves breaking up large pieces of information into smaller, easier to remember chunks. For example, a 10-digit phone number can be divided into 3 chunks of 3, 3, and 4 digits. This technique is especially useful for remembering information quickly.",
