  "input": "",
  "output": "Abstract art and traditional art are two different genres of art that have distinct characteristics. Traditional art is typically more representational and realistic, as it involves the accurate representation of a subject matter. Abstract art, on the other hand, is composed of shapes, colors, and forms that may not represent anything in the physical world. Abstract art is often more experimental, improvisational, and meant to evoke emotions or reactions from viewers through abstract imagery.",
