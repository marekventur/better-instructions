  "output": "Jane had grown up in a restrictive environment, full of rules and regulations. She had never experienced true freedom before. One day, however, she decided that she had had enough and decided to run away. She had no destination in mind and no plan for her future, but she felt liberated with each step she took away from her home. After a few days of wandering, she finally arrived at a large lake - the first place she had truly felt free. She took a deep breath of the crisp, clean air and realized that this was the first time in her life that she was truly free.",
