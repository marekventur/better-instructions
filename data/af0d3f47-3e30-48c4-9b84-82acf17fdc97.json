  "output": "A common household item that can be used to create a musical instrument is a tissue box. By cutting holes in the side of the box and stretching rubber bands through them, the box is transformed into a makeshift guitar. Rubber bands of different lengths generate different sounds, allowing the tissue box guitar to be played as an instrument.",
