  "instruction": "Design an experiment to determine if smoking affects memory.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The experiment would involve two groups of people - those who smoke and those who don't. Both groups would take a series of memory tests to determine their baseline memory level. Then, those who smoke would receive nicotine either through smoking or in another form. After a predetermined amount of time, the same memory test would be administered to both groups, and the results of the test would be compared to establish the effect of nicotine on memory.",
