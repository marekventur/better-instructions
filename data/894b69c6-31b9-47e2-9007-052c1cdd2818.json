  "instruction": "Discuss why the given concept has been such a topic of debate within society.",
  "input": "Freedom of Speech",
  "output": "Freedom of speech has been a topic of debate within society because it is seen by some as a fundamental human right, while others view it as a source of conflict and division. On the one hand, the right to express opinions freely is important for democracy and for creating a diverse and informed society. On the other hand, some people feel that the unrestricted freedom to express opinions has led to greater polarization within society, making it more difficult for people to come together to solve important problems. Even when restricting speech is seen as necessary, it can be difficult to decide which views are worthy of protection and which ones should be censored. As a result, the topic of freedom of speech remains a highly contentious one.",
