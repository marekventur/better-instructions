  "output": "The game is called Color Memory. The goal of the game is for players to match as many colors as they can in the given time limit. Each player starts by being dealt a set of color cards. On each turn, a player chooses one card from their hand and places it on the playing surface. When two matching colors are found, the player who found the match collects the cards, and the next player takes a turn. The player with the most matches at the end of the game wins.",
