  "output": "A distant enemy looms on the horizon,\nSelves of the light fight despite fear and fatigue.\nInnumerable obstacles barring their mission,\nThough seeming to weaken, strengths within achieve.\n\nRoots of bravery sustained their cause,\nThough many obstacles pushed and pulled.\nHeart's noise drowned out every pause,\nEscaping each struggle stronger and full.\n\nThe reward of their labors thought clear and light,\nThe force of the shadows still kept them at bay.\nYet further pushed and tired through the night,\nTriumph steadily came in a growing display.\n\nPeace of their struggle found in the morning's glow,\nRising higher than any unseen force's ebb and flow.",
