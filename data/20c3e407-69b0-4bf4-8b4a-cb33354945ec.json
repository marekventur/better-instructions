  "input": "",
  "output": "A black hole is an astronomical object with an extremely strong gravitational pull. It is formed when a star collapses under its own gravity. The gravity is so strong that it bends the fabric of space-time and even light is trapped within its boundaries. With no light escaping, a black hole is essentially invisible to observers and can be detected only by its gravitational effects on nearby objects.",
