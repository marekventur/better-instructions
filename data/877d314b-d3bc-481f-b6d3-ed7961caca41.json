  "input": "",
  "output": "Grilled fish is generally seen as healthier than fried fish due to the lower fat content and fewer calories. Grilling also preserves more of the nutrients in the fish, such as omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, and B vitamins, while fried fish loses a lot of these beneficial nutrients in the cooking process. Additionally, fried fish often contain trans fat and is higher in bad cholesterol than grilled fish.
