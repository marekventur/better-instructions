  "output": "Companies using AI for their employees' hiring procedure may benefit by being able to quickly identify and select the most qualified candidates for available positions. AI tools are able to analyze larger candidate databases than traditional manual review processes, drastically reducing the amount of time spent searching for qualified applicants. AI tools may also provide higher levels of insight into a candidate's qualifications and skills by making more sophisticated assessments based on the provided data. As a result, companies may be able to increase the accuracy of their hires while lowering the cost and associated risks of traditional hiring methods.",
