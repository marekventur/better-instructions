  "output": "We should save water to conserve one of our most precious resources. Water is essential for life, both for human and environmental health. Reducing water use can help conserve water and keep it available to everyone. In addition, conserving water can help reduce energy use, and help reduce pollution by limiting the need to use other sources of water such as groundwater, streams, and rivers.",
