  "input": "",
  "output": "High-end cars are typically more expensive, have longer lifespans, more advanced safety features, greater performance and more luxury features than low-end cars. Low-end cars are cheaper, have lesser safety features, which is why they tend to wear out more quickly and have more basic performance. High-end cars also have higher levels of fuel efficiency than low-end cars. In terms of luxury features, high-end cars have more comforts, bigger and better sound systems, as well as navigation and entertainment systems, while low-end cars tend to overlook such features.",
