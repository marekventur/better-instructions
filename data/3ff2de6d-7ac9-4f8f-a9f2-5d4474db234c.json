  "output": "Money laundering is the process of concealing the origin of illegally obtained money and making it appear to have been derived from legal activities. This process typically involves three steps: placement, layering, and integration. In the placement stage, money is moved from the original source to another account, often in a foreign country. In the layering stage, the money is transferred among various accounts in order to make it harder to trace back to the source. In the integration stage, the money is deposited back into the economy and appears as though it is legal, clean money.",
