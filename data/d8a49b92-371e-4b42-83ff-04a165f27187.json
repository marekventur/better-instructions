  "output": "One game you can play with two players is a game of mental math. The first player thinks of a two or three digit number and then adds, subtracts, multiples or divides it by 2. The second player then must guess the result. Players take turns thinking of numbers and the first person to guess the result correctly wins the round. The first person to win 3 rounds wins the game.",
