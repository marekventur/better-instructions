  "input": "",
  "output": "Renewable energy sources are those that can be replenished with relative ease, such as solar or wind energy, while non-renewable energy sources are limited and cannot be easily replenished, such as fossil fuels. Renewable sources are better for the environment because they do not produce any polluting emissions, while non-renewable sources are more harmful because they can lead to deforestation and the pollution of water sources.",
