  "instruction": "Present the given issue from both sides and explain the pros and cons of each.",
  "input": "Secularism",
  "output": "Secularism is viewed by many as a positive concept, in that it promotes the separation of religion and government, allowing for individual freedom of religion and belief, and protects the government from religious interference. On the other hand, some view secularism as an affront to religion, stating that it denies the importance of faith, and further justifies the belief that there is no morality or values in life that transcend human experience. The pros of secularism are that it ensures the freedom of expression and thought, and keeps the government out of religious matters. The cons are that it could be seen as a denial of the importance of faith and could lead to a lack of moral responsibility.",
