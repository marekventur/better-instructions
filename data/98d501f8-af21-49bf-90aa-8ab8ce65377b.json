  "input": "string = \"hello\"",
  "output": "The following algorithm can be used to find the total number of substrings in a given string: \n\n1. Initialize two variables, count and n, and set count = 0 and n = the length of the string. \n2. Iterate through the length of the string using a for loop and set a variable i as the iterator. \n3. Inside the loop, set another nested loop that allows j to iterate over a range beginning at i and ending at n. \n4. Increment count by n minus i when the inner loop ends. \n5. After the outer loop ends, return count. \n\nThis algorithm will give us the total number of substrings in a given string.",
