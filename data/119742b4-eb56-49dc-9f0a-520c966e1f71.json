  "input": "",
  "output": "The increased demand for fossil fuels has several implications. One of the most pressing is the impact on global climate change as the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This contributes to the warming of the atmosphere and sea levels rise, leading to more extreme weather, disruption of ecosystems, and economic disruption. Additionally, there is the difficulty in the responsible extraction, storage, and distribution of fossil fuels, which can lead to serious environmental and safety risks.",
