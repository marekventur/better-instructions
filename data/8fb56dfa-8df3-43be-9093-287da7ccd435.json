  "input": "",
  "output": "The statement that \"learning AI is an expensive process\" is generally true, as there are typically high costs associated with developing and training AI systems. This includes the cost of data, computing power, and personnel, as well as the cost of research, development, and deployment. Additionally, depending on the use case, there can also be costs associated with maintaining and updating AI systems.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the cost of learning AI can be reduced, such as by utilizing open source software, leveraging cloud computing, and training AI models on existing datasets.",
