  "output": "I would set a schedule of study, selecting from the available lessons, towards achieving my goal of learning a language in two months. I would plan to commit a certain amount of time each day devoted to studying and learning the language. I would also try to create practice opportunities to use the language by speaking with a classmate or researching online tutorials and recordings. Additionally, I would seek out native speakers of the language to help me with pronunciation and other nuances of the language.",
