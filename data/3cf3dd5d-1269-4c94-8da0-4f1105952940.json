  "instruction": "Take a complicated theory or concept, and explain it as simply as possible.",
  "input": "The Catastrophe Theory",
  "output": "The Catastrophe Theory is a mathematical theory that explains how systems with multiple inputs can suddenly change in an unexpected way. It's based on the idea that seemingly small changes in the inputs to a system can result in drastic changes in the overall output. For example, a slight change in the temperature of a room could cause a rapid change in humidity and air pressure, leading to a sudden thunderstorm.",
