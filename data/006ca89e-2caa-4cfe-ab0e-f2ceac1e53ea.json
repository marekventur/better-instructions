  "output": "Brave we must be, 'tis our choice to make,\nTo challenge the norms, to take the stake.\nThe battles fought, the wrinkles on our face,\nWill never be a sign of disgrace.\n\nWe'll never look back, no matter how much we break,\nFor we must be true, and muffle our ache.\nWe walk a different path, with no one by our side,\nBut our spirit and courage will never subside.\n\nWe stride forward and up, one step at a time,\nNot bowing to pressure, not caving in to the climb.\nNo matter the consequence, no matter the cost,\nWe'll fight with both heart and mind, 'till our battle's lost.\n\nBrave we must be, and never will we see,\nThe bitter taste of failure, no matter how far we go.\nFor our spirit will never subside, to be brave, 'tis our right to show.",
