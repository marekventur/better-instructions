  "input": "",
  "output": "Reducing plastic waste is an important issue for our environment and our future. Plastic waste is non-biodegradable and can take centuries to decompose, leading to the accumulation of waste in landfills and oceans. Plastic waste also contributes to air and water pollution. Further, plastic waste can harm wildlife, with animals often mistaking plastic pieces for food or becoming entangled in it. \nThe best way to reduce plastic waste is to reduce our consumption of single-use plastic items and instead utilize reusable, sustainable items. Governments and businesses should also be encouraged to develop sustainable practices and opt for biodegradable plastic alternatives. Reducing plastic waste is crucial to preserving our environment and ensuring our sustainable future.",
