  "input": "",
  "output": "The Bank of England's monetary policy is focused on using council decisions and interest rates to ensure monetary (money supply) and financial stability, as well as to support economic growth. The primary tool is changing the base interest rate of the UK economy, which is the price of borrowing from the Bank of England. Lower interest rates stimulate the economy by encouraging banks to lend more to consumers and businesses, while higher interest rates slow demand by making borrowing more expensive. \n\nIn addition to setting interest rates, the Bank of England also implements a program of 'quantitative easing'. This is where the Bank creates new money to increase the total amount of money circulating in the economy. The new money encourages banks to lend more and also bolsters economic growth. By increasing the money supply, the Bank also aims to keep prices stable by controlling inflation.\n\nUltimately, the Bank of England's monetary policy is designed to keep the economy stable and growing. This is achieved by setting the appropriate level of interest rates and implementing various measures to ensure the money supply is not causing inflation.",
