  "input": "",
  "output": "The Cuban Missile Crisis was a 13-day stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1962 over the placement of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The Soviet Union had agreed to place missiles on Cuban soil with the understanding that they would counter any U.S. missile threats to the Soviet Union while ensuring Cuba's security. The U.S. discovered the plans and drove a diplomatic stand-off that threatened nuclear war. The crisis was ultimately resolved peacefully when Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union, agreed to remove the missiles in return for the U.S. agreeing not to invade Cuba.",
