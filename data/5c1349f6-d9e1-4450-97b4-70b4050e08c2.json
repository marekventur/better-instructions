  "input": "",
  "output": "Google Research is exploring the field of neuroevolution and using evolutionary algorithms to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Neural Networks for machine learning systems. Neuroevolution is the process by which an AI system modifies its own neural structure and architecture to increase its ability to learn and solve problems. This research could open up improvements in areas such as robotics, gaming and vision systems. Using neuroevolution, machines can be made more efficient and reliable by eliminating the need for human-designed components and functions. Neuroevolution will soon become a widely adopted tool for building intelligent systems and Google Research is on the cutting edge of this research.",
