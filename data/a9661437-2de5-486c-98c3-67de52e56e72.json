  "output": "Write a program that takes an array of integers as input, and returns a set of the triplets whose sum is zero.\n\nGiven an array of integers, your task is to write a program to find all triplets whose sum is equal to zero. For example, if the array is [3, -2, 0, 1, 3, -1], the program should output [-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 1], and [3, 0, -3].",
