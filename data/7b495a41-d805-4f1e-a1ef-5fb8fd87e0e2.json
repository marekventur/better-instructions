  "output": "Here are some tips for improving speaking skills: \n- Improve your confidence by getting comfortable with the material you are speaking about. Stay informed about current topics and practice discussing points with friends and family to become more confident. \n- Speak slowly and clearly, with good pauses and proper pronunciation. Make sure you enunciate and avoid mumbling, particularly with new words.\n- Make sure you know your audience. For example, use different language when speaking to young kids than when presenting to adults.\n- Use body language to help convey your message and also to show confidence. Standing up tall, maintaining good eye contact, and using hand gestures are all effective ways to engage your audience.\n- Structure your speech around a main point, supporting it with evidence and relevant stories that keep your audience engaged.\n- Practice your delivery ahead of time and focus on current best practices. This can range from using videos to record your speech to employing AI tools to receive feedback. \n- Find ways to make your message memorable. Whether it's a funny story or interesting visual aid, providing your audience with something to relate to and remember will help them understand your point.",
