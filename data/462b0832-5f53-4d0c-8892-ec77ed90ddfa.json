  "input": "",
  "output": "The interface for ordering sandwiches from a deli should be intuitive, easy to use and should provide visual cues to guide users throughout the process. The main page should list all sandwich options and include appropriate images to give users an idea of what they are ordering. A selection bar should be provided that allows users to customize the size, toppings and condiments on their sandwiches. The user should be able to track the progress of the order, and when the sandwich is ready for pickup, a confirmation page should be displayed with order details and a notification. Payment options should also be provided that include the option to pay cash or with a credit card. Lastly, the interface should include a \u201cfavorites\u201d or \u201ccustom orders\u201d option so users can save their preferences and quickly order their favorite combos.",
