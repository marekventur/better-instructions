  "instruction": "Provide a brief summary of the article below related to using computer vision for population health.",
  "input": "Computer vision technology applied to population health is an emerging field with a potential to leverage machine learning algorithms, camera-equipped devices, and medical imaging to identify health risks in populations. For example, computer vision can be used to identify and aggregate physical traits, detect disease, and spot environmental hazards that lead to health risks across large populations.",
  "output": "Computer vision technology is being increasingly harnessed to improve population health outcomes. It can be used to identify physical traits, detect diseases, and spot environmental hazards in large populations. Computer vision algorithms and devices that are equipped with cameras are making population health initiatives more accurate, effective, and less resource-intensive.",
