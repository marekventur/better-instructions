I've been thinking a lot about what you said the last time we talked and I wanted to let you know that I'm always here for you if you need someone to talk to. I know it's been tough lately, but remember that you can always turn to me if you need anything. Let me know if you ever want to talk!\n\nTake care and I hope to hear from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n[your name]",
