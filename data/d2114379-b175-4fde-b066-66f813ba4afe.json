  "output": "Once upon a time there lived two old friends, Robert and John. Robert lived in a cottage in the woods while John lived in a small hut in the far away village. Despite the distance between them, they were always in touch with each other, sending letters and gifts to stay connected.\n\nOne day, Robert sent to John a large chest filled with all of Robert's worldly possessions. Robert was sure that with the chest, John could start a new life. John was overwhelmed with joy but felt strange, as he had nothing ofhis own to give back in return. \n\nBut right when Robert was about to leave, John realized he had a gift of his own to offer. He looked into his own chest and saw he had been keeping a special book. It was filled with all the letters Robert had sent him over the years, along with stories about their friendship.\n\nJohn presented the book to Robert and said, \u201cThis, my friend, is a gift from me to you. A gift of my friendship, something money can\u2019t buy.\u201d\n\nMoral: True friendship is beyond any material possessions.",
