  "output": "Billy was an ordinary kid, until the day he discovered that he had extraordinary powers. Instead of being good and fighting villains like other superheroes, Billy used his powers for selfish acts like stealing candy, skipping work and avoiding exercise. Out of fear, people kept their distance from him as he used his special skills to make life easier for himself. He eventually became bored of his own antics and realized that his powers weren't intended for being bad. In order to find a purpose and create a new identity for himself, Billy decided to use his special abilities to help people in need and fight crime. Thus, the Antihero was born! He embraced his new identity and sought to make a difference in the world, one good deed at a time.",
