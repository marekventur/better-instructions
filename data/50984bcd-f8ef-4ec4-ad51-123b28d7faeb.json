  "input": "",
  "output": "Friend 1: Hey, why do you think history is so important? \nFriend 2: Well, it gives us an understanding of where we\u2019ve been and how we\u2019ve gotten to where we are today. It teaches us lessons from the past, so that we can make better informed decisions in the present. Plus, it\u2019s always fascinating to learn about different cultures and customs from historical times. \nFriend 1: Yeah, I can see how it can be useful but it seems so overwhelming and boring to learn about. \nFriend 2: It doesn\u2019t have to be boring! There are lots of stories and intriguing facts that help you make history a lot more interesting. You just need to find what interests you the most and go from there.",
