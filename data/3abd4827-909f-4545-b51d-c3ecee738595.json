  "instruction": "Predict what will happen if an airplane exceeds the speed of sound.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "If an airplane exceeds the speed of sound, a phenomenon known as a sonic boom will occur. A sonic boom is caused by shock waves created by the disturbance of air particles as the airplane passes through them at supersonic speeds. These shock waves travel at the speed of sound and create a loud noise resembling thunder. The airplane itself may experience shock waves as well, resulting in structural and mechanical damage.",
