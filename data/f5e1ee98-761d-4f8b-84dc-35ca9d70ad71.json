  "instruction": "Tell me how to solve the following math equation.",
  "input": "2x + 3y = 15",
  "output": "To solve this equation, first subtract 3y from both sides to get 2x = 15 - 3y. Then, divide both sides by 2 to get x = (15 - 3y) / 2. Finally, substitute the value of x back into the equation and solve for y to get y = 5/3.",
