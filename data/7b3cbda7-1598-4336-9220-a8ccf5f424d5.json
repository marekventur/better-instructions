  "output": "The main differences between a tornado and a hurricane are the size, intensity, wind speed and duration. Tornadoes are relatively small and short-lived, typically lasting a few minutes, with wind speeds up to 300 miles per hour. Hurricanes, on the other hand, are much larger and can last for days, with wind speeds up to 150 miles per hour. Tornadoes tend to have a much narrower path, while hurricanes cover a much wider area. Additionally, tornadoes usually form over land, while hurricanes form over oceans.",
