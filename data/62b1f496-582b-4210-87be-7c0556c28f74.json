  "input": "",
  "output": "The Hubble Space Telescope works by collecting light from distant objects and detecting new stars, planets and galaxies. Its primary mirror collects the light, which is then focused onto a camera and spectrometer, which decode the light through a variety of digital filters. This data is sent to scientists on Earth who can then analyze it to gain a better understanding of the universe.",
