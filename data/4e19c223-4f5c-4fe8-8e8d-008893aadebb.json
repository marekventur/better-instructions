  "instruction": "Generate a creative wind power generator design.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The design will involve using a vertical wind turbine with blades that rotate around a central axis. This turbine will be attached to a pylon near the ground, which will collect the energy generated by the turbine and convert it into electricity. The blades will be designed to capture the wind at different angles and generate more power. Additionally, the turbine will be designed to automatically adjust its position and optimize power generation in different wind directions.",
