  "instruction": "Suggest an argument for why a more diverse team may make better decisions.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A more diverse team may make better decisions because it brings together different perspectives, experiences, and ideas. For example, people from different backgrounds may see the same problem in different ways and come up with solutions that are outside the scope of what a more homogeneous team might generate. Research has found that teams consisting of people from different backgrounds and experiences tend to challenge existing assumptions and mental models, leading to more innovative solutions to problems that may have otherwise been overlooked. In addition, increased diversity can lead to increased collaboration, higher employee engagement, and better understanding of target audiences, which can all improve overall decision making.",
