  "input": "",
  "output": "Three methods of validating a machine learning model are holdout validation, k-fold cross-validation, and bootstrapping. Holdout validation involves splitting the data into training and test sets, and then training the model on the training set and testing it on the test set. K-fold cross-validation randomly splits the data into k equal-sized subsets and tests the model k times on different combinations of the subsets. Bootstrapping randomly samples the same data multiple times and builds a model from each sample.",
