  "output": "A hash table would be an appropriate data structure for storing a large set of integers. A hash table is a data structure that utilizes key/value pairs and allows for O(1) lookup time. A hash table is also space efficient, so it is capable of storing a large number of items without taking up too much space. Its quick lookup time and efficient storage make it an ideal data structure for storing large sets of integers.",
