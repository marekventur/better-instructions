  "output": "Photosynthesis involves plants using the energy from the sun to turn water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and other materials. This lets plants make the food they need to grow. The process starts when sunlight hits a plant's leaves and is absorbed by a special chemical. The chemical then mixes with water and carbon dioxide from the air to make food for the plant.",
