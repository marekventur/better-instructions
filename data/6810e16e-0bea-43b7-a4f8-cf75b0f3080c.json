  "output": "Three mammals that are capable of holding tools are chimpanzees, dolphins, and humans. Chimpanzees use tools for a variety of tasks, such as using sticks to fish for insects, using stones as hammers and anvils to crack nuts, and even using leaf sponges to drink water. Dolphins use sticks and sponges to forage for food, and humans are known for using tools for everything from communication and hunting to transportation and space exploration.",
