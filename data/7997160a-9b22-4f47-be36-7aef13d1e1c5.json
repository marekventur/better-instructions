  "input": "",
  "output": "Scalar quantities have only magnitude or size, while vector quantities have both magnitude and direction. Scalar quantities can be expressed in numbers, while vector quantities require a direction to be expressed accurately. Examples of scalars include mass, temperature, and time, while examples of vectors include force, velocity, and momentum.",
