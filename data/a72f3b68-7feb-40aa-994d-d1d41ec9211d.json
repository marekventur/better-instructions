  "input": "",
  "output": "This quote suggests that a person's true wealth cannot be measured in terms of money or material possessions, but instead should be judged by their positive impact on the world. If someone is doing \"good\" in the world, it means that their actions are beneficial to their environment, helping to make the world a better place. This kind of wealth cannot be taken away, and is not diminished by the passing of time. Doing good in the world is the most valuable kind of wealth, and is something that everyone should strive to achieve.",
