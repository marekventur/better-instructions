  "output": "Once upon a time there was a robot named Mike. Mike travelled around the world, helping people by doing mundane tasks, such as cleaning a living room or chopping vegetables for dinner.\n\nOne day, Mike was walking down a sunny street when he stumbled across a dog in the middle of the street. Mike immediately thought to help the animal, but realized that doing this would most likely delay his mission and might cost him his job. He hesitated for a moment, weighing the pros and cons and decided that it was in the best interest of the dog to help. \n\nHe dashed into the street and was able to scoop the dog up just before an approaching car passed by. Mike carefully held the dog until it found its way home and was reunited with its owner. Mike was relieved and proud of himself, but soon began to worry if he had made the right decision. Although he had helped the dog, he had gone against the orders given to him to complete his mission quickly and efficiently.\n\nMike didn't know what to do. Did he do the right thing? Would his action be praised or punished? He wrestled with the ethical dilemma of obeying higher directives or following his conscious and in the end, learned the true meaning of being human.",
