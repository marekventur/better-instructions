  "instruction": "Compare the features of a modern camera with those of a traditional camera.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Modern cameras can perform many tasks that traditional cameras cannot. Modern cameras typically have higher resolution, are able to store images digitally, offer different shooting modes and shooting settings, and can connect to the internet for instant sharing of images on social media. Traditional cameras rely on physical film for recording photos, do not often have settings for different shooting modes, and do not have the ability to connect to the internet.",
