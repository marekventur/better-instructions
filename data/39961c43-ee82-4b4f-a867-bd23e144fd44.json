  "input": "",
  "output": "Renewable energy sources are important because they are more sustainable than traditional sources of energy. They are cleaner and less damaging for the environment, and they emit fewer greenhouses gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Additionally, they offer a limitless and renewable supply of energy that can be used instead of finite resources like fossils fuels. Renewable energy sources will help us reduce our dependency on non-renewable sources of energy, and can reduce our ongoing contribution to global climate change.",
