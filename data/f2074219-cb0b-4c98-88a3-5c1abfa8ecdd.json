  "input": "",
  "output": "Deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services, or a decrease in the amount of money and credit available, or both. It is the opposite of inflation, which is an increase in the general price level of goods and services. In deflation, consumers have less purchasing power because the same amount of money buys fewer goods and services.",
