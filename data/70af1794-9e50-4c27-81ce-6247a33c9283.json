  "instruction": "How does a capacitor store energy?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A capacitor stores energy by collecting electric charge on its two plates, with one plate storing positive charge and the other storing negative charge. When a voltage is applied across the capacitor, electrons are drawn to the positive plate and the voltage causes a current to flow. This flow of current between the two plates causes the plates to store energy, which can then be released when the voltage is removed.",
