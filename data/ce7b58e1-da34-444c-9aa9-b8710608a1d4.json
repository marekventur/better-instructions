  "input": "",
  "output": "When examining a new dataset, I would first focus on understanding the structure of the data. I would answer questions like how many columns and rows are in the dataset, what data types are included, what data is missing, and if there are any unexpected values. Next, I would explore the data by summarizing the values in each column like computing average or maximum values, identifying any outliers or patterns within the data, and creating visualizations to better understand the distribution of values. Finally, I would focus on understanding the relationships between columns and watch out for any correlations or trends that could be useful to explore further.",
