  "output": "When you're running late, the best course of action is to try and keep your cool. Take a deep breath, and make a plan for how you can make up the time. Figure out the quickest route to your destination and if possible, call ahead to let the person or people you're meeting know that you'll be late. If you're unable to make up the time, apologize and explain why you're running late. Making sure to be as honest and forthcoming as possible.",
