  "instruction": "Design an experiment to determine how long it takes for bread to cool after it is taken out of the oven.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "For the experiment, three loaves of bread should be prepared-- one should be left in the oven and taken out after 10 minutes, another after 20 minutes, and the last one after 30 minutes. When all three loaves are taken out of the oven, each loaf should be placed on the same surface and a temperature probe should be inserted into the center of each loaf. At regular intervals (e.g. every 5 minutes) over the course of an hour, the temperature of each loaf should be recorded. At the end of the hour, the temperatures of the loaves should be compared to determine how long it takes for bread to cool after being taken out of the oven.",
