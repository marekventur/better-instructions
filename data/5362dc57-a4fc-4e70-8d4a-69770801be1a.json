  "input": "",
  "output": "OAuth is a secure open standard for authorization. It provides users with the ability to grant website and application access to their data without having to share their login information. OAuth offers several benefits, such as increased security, user convenience, and decoupling of applications. It also allows users to keep their passwords private while allowing websites or applications to access user data with permission. OAuth also enables users to have greater control of their data, and can be used to access multiple accounts with a single login.",
