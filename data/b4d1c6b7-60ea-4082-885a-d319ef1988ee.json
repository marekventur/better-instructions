  "instruction": "Critique the following website.",
  "input": "https://www.soylux.com/",
  "output": "The website for Soylux lacks a sense of cohesion - the fonts, colors, and visuals used throughout the site feel disparate and disorganized. Moreover, the copywriting isn't up to date, going as far as to refer to certain products as \"revolutionary,\" which has become a clich\u00e9. The site design could be improved by creating a streamlined and unified aesthetic, as well as refreshing the copywriting to make it more impactful.",
