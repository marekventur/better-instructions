  "output": "\"Avengers: Endgame\" is the culmination of a 22-film arc, and was the final movie in the Infinity Saga. The plot follows the Avengers as they try to undo the damage caused by the Mad Titan Thanos, who wiped out half of all living beings. The movie contains several plot twists and turns, but the most important plot points focus on time travel, the consequences of the threat posed by Thanos, and the ultimate sacrifice of several beloved characters. Other important moments include Tony Stark's creation of an artificial intelligence that is able to use the Infinity Stones, and the emergence of a new team of Avengers to take the place of the previous one. The film's climax is when the Avengers succeed in reversing the Snap and restoring the lives of those that had been killed. In the aftermath of their victory, the world is shown to be picking up the pieces and life has returned to relative normalcy.",
