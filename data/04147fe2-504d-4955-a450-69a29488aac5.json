  "input": "",
  "output": "We live in a world where the powerful have taken advantage of the less powerful for generations, and continue to do so. We need a revolution in order to create true equality and justice for all. We must advocate for the rights of all people, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status. We must fight for systemic reform that shifts power to the people and takes the control away from the wealthy and privileged. We must rise up and use our collective voice to force those in power to institute real change. Our fight must be rooted in love and compassion, and ultimately focused on creating a world where everyone can live in peace, freedom, and equality.",
