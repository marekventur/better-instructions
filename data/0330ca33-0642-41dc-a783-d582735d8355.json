  "output": "The process of exploration and development of a new drug involves a series of steps. This includes researching and understanding the disease mechanism, identifying possible drug targets, and designing and testing a molecule that will interact effectively with them. The molecule is then refined to increase its efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness. Clinical trials are conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of the drug, followed by approval from regulatory authorities. The drug is then manufactured, marketed and prescribed before it is available for use.",
