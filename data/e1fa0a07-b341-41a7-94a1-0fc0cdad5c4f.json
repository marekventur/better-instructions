As she stood there, afraid and uncertain, she mustered up all her courage and, despite the danger, took a few steps forward.  She quickly grabbed the snake and put it in her bag, knowing that it was the only way she could continue. She had taken a brave step and successfully emerged from that dangerous place with the rare plant.",
