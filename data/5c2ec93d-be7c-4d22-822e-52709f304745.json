  "input": "",
  "output": "Democratic regimes tend to promote individual liberty, citizen participation, and the rule of law, while authoritarian regimes emphasize hierarchy, obedience to higher authorities, and control over the population. Democratic regimes are based on popular sovereignty and the idea that the citizens should be able to influence the decisions of their government, while authoritarian governments are ruled by one individual or group who exerts control over the population with the use of fear and force. In democratic regimes, citizens are often free to dissent and express diverging opinions, while citizens in authoritarian regimes are subject to strict control and severe punishment if they do not obey the authorities.",
