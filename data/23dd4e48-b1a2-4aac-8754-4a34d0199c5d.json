  "instruction": "Check if the author\u2019s tone in the passage is appropriate for a school essay.",
  "input": "I'm the type of person who will stop at nothing to get what they want. I'm not only ambitious, I'm aggressive in my pursuit of goals, and I never give up. Every challenge I come across, I see as an opportunity to learn and grow as a person.",
  "output": "No, the tone in this passage is not appropriate for a school essay. It is too assertive and overly confident, and it does not demonstrate a respect for rules and proper etiquette. A more appropriate tone would be one of respect and appropriate modesty. Furthermore, rather than focusing on one's drive and determination, the essay should emphasize academic and personal growth.",
