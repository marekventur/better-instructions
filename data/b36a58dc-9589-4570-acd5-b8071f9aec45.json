  "output": "Tying a bow tie requires four steps. Begin by wrapping one side of the bow tie around your neck, with the two ends of the tie hanging down. Overlap the left side of the tie over the right, so the right end extends slightly further. Then, turn the right end up and over your left chin, and loop it down around your neck. Finally, loop the left end over the right, and bringing the end of the bow tie up and over the back of the right loop, creating a symmetrical knot. Tighten and adjust the knot, and you are done!",
