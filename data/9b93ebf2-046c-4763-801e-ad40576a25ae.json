  "instruction": "Describe the difference between hailing a taxi and booking a ride on an app.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Hailing a taxi is the traditional way of getting a ride, which involves raising your arm on the street and waiting for an available taxi to pull over. Booking a ride through an app is a more modern way that involves using a mobile application to find a nearby driver and book a ride. The booking method is more convenient and efficient than hailing a taxi as it allows you to enter your desired pickup and drop off location, choose a vehicle type, and pay in advance.",
