  "input": "",
  "output": "Newton\u2019s second law of motion states that a force acting on an object is equal to the mass times the acceleration of the object. In other words, force is equal to the rate of change of momentum of the object. This means that any two objects with the same mass, moving at the same rate of acceleration, will produce the same amount of force.",
