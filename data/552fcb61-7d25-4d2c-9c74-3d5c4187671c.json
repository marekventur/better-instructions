  "output": "Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to analyze high-dimensional datasets and reduce them to fewer dimensions, helping to capture underlying patterns, detect correlations, and identify trends. PCA projects all data points onto a new coordinate system, so that the points that most influence the variance in the data are positioned at the origin. It helps machine learning models to reduce the number of input variables and to reveal the underlying structure of data.",
