  "input": "",
  "output": "Supervised learning is divided into two main types: classification and regression. In classification, the goal is to predict a categorical label such as a yes/no, true/false, or a number of discrete classes. In regression, the goal is to predict a continuous variable such as temperature or price. Both of these tasks are accomplished by learning a mapping from a set of input features to an output label or value. Classification is used when the output is categorical, while regression is used when the output is a continuous variable. Both of these algorithms require labeled data in order to learn the mapping between the features and the label.",
