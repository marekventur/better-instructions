  "output": "Dave entered the abandoned house with caution. He had heard about its mysterious past and was not sure what he would find. He took a step inside the doorway and looked around. Dust covered the floor, and it was dimly lit. He stepped further into the house and heard a strange noise coming from the back room. He crept closer, trying to stay quiet. When he finally arrived at the back room, he was met with an unexpected sight. There were two people, shrouded in cloaks, having a conversation. Dave stood there in shock, not knowing what to do or say. The two people looked up and Dave quickly ran back in the direction he had come from. What secret did this house hold? He was scared to find out.",
