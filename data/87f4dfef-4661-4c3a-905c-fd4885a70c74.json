  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between a fable and a parable is that a fable is a story with animals as characters and typically contains a moral, whereas a parable is a story with human characters from which a moral can be inferred. Fables often contain anthropomorphic characters, while parables often contain allegorical elements. Fables are usually short stories, while parables can be longer.",
