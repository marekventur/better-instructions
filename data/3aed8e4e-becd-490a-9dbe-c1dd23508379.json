  "input": "",
  "output": "Wealth inequality is the unequal distribution of resources, such as money, investments, and property, between individuals or groups in society. It can also refer to the uneven distribution of opportunities and access to power. Wealthy individuals have more access to and control over resources, while those with less wealth have fewer resources or access to capital. This unequal distribution leads to some individuals or groups having a much higher standard of living than others, leading to an inequality of wealth.",
