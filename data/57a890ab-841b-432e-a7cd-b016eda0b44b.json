  "input": "",
  "output": "Galileo Galilei conducted an experiment involving dropping two weights of different masses from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He wanted to test his hypothesis that regardless of the weight, all objects fall at the same rate, and the results supported his hypothesis. By timing how long it took each weight to reach the ground, he was able to conclude that gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate.",
