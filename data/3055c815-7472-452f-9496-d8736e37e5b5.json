  "instruction": "How does Newton's second law of motion explain the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Newton's second law of motion states that a net force applied to a mass will cause it to accelerate, and the acceleration is proportional to the force divided by the mass. Therefore, the greater the force applied to an object with a given mass, the greater its acceleration. Conversely, the greater the mass of an object, the less its acceleration will be with a given amount of force.",
