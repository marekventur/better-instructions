  "input": "The study investigated the compressive and tension fatigue properties of truck tyre rubber subjected to curing temperatures varying between 25 and 120 \u00b0C. Curing temperatures of \u03b2-diketone based rubber compounded with carbon black, silica and zinc oxide were considered.",
  "output": "This study looked at how heat affects the strength of rubber used in truck tires. We examined the effects of curing temperatures from 25\u00b0C to 120\u00b0C on the tire rubber, which was mixed with carbon black, silica, and zinc oxide. We found that the higher the curing temperature, the more \u201cstrong\u201d the rubber became.",
