  "output": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a technique used to identify and classify text entities into pre-defined categories such as person names, locations, organizations, and dates. NER is widely used in many applications, from information extraction to automated summarization. By recognizing different entities, it can provide a better understanding of the text, enabling tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and automatic text categorization. As an example, NER can be used to extract people's names from a set of tweets and cluster them for better understanding of user behavior.",
