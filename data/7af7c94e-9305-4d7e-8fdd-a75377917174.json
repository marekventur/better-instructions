  "output": "One way to make exercise a part of your daily routine is to set achievable goals for yourself. Start with simple goals that you can actually accomplish. Break up the goals into manageable chunks and find a way to measure your progress. This will help you feel a sense of accomplishment and success. Schedule the activity as you would for any other important activity and try to keep to the same time each day. It may also help to try out different sports and activities to keep things interesting. Finally, reward yourself after each successful workout and remember that it's OK to take a short break when needed.",
