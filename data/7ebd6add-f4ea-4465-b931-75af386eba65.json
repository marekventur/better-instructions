  "output": "The perfect day in New York would start by getting an early start, to catch the sunrise over the city skyline. Next, head to the top of the Empire State Building for incredible views of Manhattan. Then, explore SoHo\u2019s trendy shops and galleries, before stopping for lunch in Central Park. In the afternoon, take a stroll down the iconic Fifth Avenue and get a selfie in front of the Flatiron Building. In the evening, take a spin around the ice rink at Rockefeller Center, followed by dinner and a show on Broadway. Wrap up the day with bird\u2019s eye views of the city from the Top of the Rock observation deck.",
