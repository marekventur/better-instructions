  "input": "Instructions: Given an array of integers, find all the pairs that have a sum of k.",
  "output": "The algorithm should iterate through the array and for each element, check if there is an element with which it makes a pair that adds up to k. If such a pair is found, the elements should be added to the result list. This process should be repeated until all elements in the array have been checked.",
