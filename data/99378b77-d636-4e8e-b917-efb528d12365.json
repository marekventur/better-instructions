  "output": "Alice was suddenly trapped in a mysterious room with no windows or doors. She yelled for help, but no one answered. But then she started hearing faint music from outside, it sounded like a children\u2019s playground. Puzzled, she made her way to the window and looked outside. To her shock, the window was blocked by a person looking in, as if they were peeking into the room. She quickly stepped away and searched the room, hoping to find an escape. After looking around for a bit, she found a key hidden beneath the bed. She quickly tried it in the door and it opened. As she stepped outside, she was relieved to see that the person peeking into the window was just a child playing in the playground.",
