  "input": "",
  "output": "A driverless car uses computer vision algorithms to identify and understand the world around it. In the case of stopping at a sign, the car would use its cameras, LiDAR and radar sensors to detect the sign and identify it. It would recognize the sign as a stop sign according to the design and shape, and then the car would slow down and come to a complete stop, following the rules of the road.",
