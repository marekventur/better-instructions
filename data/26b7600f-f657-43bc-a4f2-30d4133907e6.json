  "input": "",
  "output": "The movie The Matrix presents a world where technology controls our lives in a number of ways. Firstly, the main character, Neo, wakes up to discover that a computer program is controlling every aspect of his reality; even the people he knows and loves are part of the computer system. This implies that technology has taken away our ability to have true control over our lives and our reality is actually just a simulation. Similarly, Neo is given the choice to remain in the comfort of his current reality or take the red pill to see the truth of what is really happening; implying that technology can prevent us from uncovering or understanding the truth of our lives. Finally, Neo is ultimately able to \u201cbreak the code\u201d and control the Matrix, which suggests that technology can also be used to our advantage if used creatively.",
