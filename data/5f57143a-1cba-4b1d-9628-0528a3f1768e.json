It is vital to the functioning of a healthy democracy, as it allows citizens to have their voices heard as well as having a direct effect on who represents them and the policies that are implemented. The consequences of not exercising this important privilege could be severe, from a lack of representation to allowing certain policies to be enacted that endanger our civil rights and liberties. We all must take action to ensure that we continue to have a strong and fair democracy by using our right and privilege to vote.",
