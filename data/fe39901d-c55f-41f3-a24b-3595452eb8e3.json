  "output": "Energy security is the ability of a country to secure reliable access to a reliable and affordable supply of energy, such as electricity and petroleum reserves. This requires a secure, resilient and diverse supply of energy sources, which can withstand external shocks, such as extreme weather or international sanctions. It also requires suitable energy infrastructure, and in some instances the development of a smart grid, to store and distribute energy resources when needed.",
