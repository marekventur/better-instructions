  "input": "",
  "output": "Object-oriented programming languages and procedural programming languages differ in terms of the fundamentals of programming. Object-oriented programming languages prioritize objects over functions while procedural programming languages prioritize functions over objects. Also, object-oriented programming is based on the concept of inheritance where classes in the same hierarchy can inherit methods and variables, whereas procedural programming does not have the concept of inheritance. Decisions made in object-oriented programming depend on the objects, while in procedural programming they depend on the flow of the program. \n// end of output //",
