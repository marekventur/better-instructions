  "input": "",
  "output": "Three challenges associated with the use of AI in healthcare include data privacy and security, ethical considerations and lack of trust. Firstly, data privacy and security is a critical problem as AI algorithms require large amounts of sensitive personal data to function. Secondly, while AI can help improve patient care, it should be used responsibly since it may involve making value judgements that are potentially biased. Finally, many patients and healthcare providers lack trust in AI technology due to lack of understanding and fear of misuse, which can restrict its implementation.",
