  "output": "Cloud computing offers three major benefits: scalability, cost savings and reliability. By migrating applications and data to the cloud, businesses are able to scale their operations easily to meet the needs of their customers. This scalability helps businesses save money on upfront investments, such as servers and equipment, that would otherwise be necessary to facilitate those operations. Additionally, cloud computing offers the added benefit of improved reliability. With cloud-based solutions, businesses can ensure that their applications and data remain secure, as they are hosted in a reliable data center. This can provide businesses with peace of mind, knowing that their operations and data are secure and protected.",
