  "input": "",
  "output": "A common machine learning algorithm used for solving classification tasks is Support Vector Machines (SVM). SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a combination of linear classification and non-linear classification techniques to maximize accuracy and minimize generalization errors. It can also handle large datasets easily and provide better prediction results than other algorithms.",
