  "input": "Proposed Method: Neural persistence",
  "output": "A good way to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed Neural Persistence method is to compare its performance with existing methods on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, natural language processing, or any other task where a complexity measure can be beneficial. This comparison can be performed by analyzing the accuracy of the model for each task, or if possible, the running time. As a way to validate the proposed method further, a set of experiments can be conducted in which different parameters of the model are varied to observe how it affects its outputs.",
