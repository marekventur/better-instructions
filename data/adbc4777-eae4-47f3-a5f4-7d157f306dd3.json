  "output": "A recent study conducted by researchers has confirmed that climate change is the leading cause of species extinction. This study looked at a sample of vertebrates from 1950 to 2019, and found that species that were vulnerable to climate change had a greater chance of going extinct. The findings point to a need for immediate action to prevent further extinctions, as climate change continues to accelerate and have a greater effect on the environment. The study also highlights the need for increased protection of vulnerable species that are particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change.",
