  "input": "",
  "output": "A spellchecker works by comparing the words in a piece of text against a dictionary of accepted words. If it finds a word that is not in the dictionary, it flags the word and offers suggestions for a correct spelling. The spellchecker also takes into account the context of the misspelling and may offer multiple suggestions.",
