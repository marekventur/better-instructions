  "input": "",
  "output": "Global warming is caused by human activities that emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. This buildup of these gases traps heat from the sun, leading to a rise in global temperatures. This rise in temperatures has already resulted in more frequent and intense storms, droughts, and heatwaves, as well as melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and a decrease in biodiversity. Even more concerning, if left unchecked, global warming could lead to catastrophic effects, such as sea-level rise, widespread famine, and even human extinction. This makes it all the more urgent for us to take immediate action to address and reduce the causes of global warming.",
