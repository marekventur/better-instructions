  "output": "The Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh is a quintessential example of Expressionism and is one of his most well-known paintings. Two key features of the painting are its vibrant color palette, and its dynamic and almost dream-like composition. The painting is characterized by a palette of vivid blues, yellows, and oranges, creating an emotional atmosphere that is evocative of the star-strewn night sky. Additionally, the composition of the painting is full of swirling and swirling lines that evoke a sense of motion and energy. These characteristic features combine to create a richly expressive and impactful masterpiece.",
