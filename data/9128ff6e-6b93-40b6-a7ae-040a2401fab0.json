  "input": "",
  "output": "The main difference between human learning and machine learning is that human learning is driven by experience whereas machine learning is driven by algorithms. Human learning is based on experience and may be harder to teach and transfer; machine learning is purely data-driven and can be taught through algorithms. Humans are able to think logically, make connections and form abstract concepts from their experiences, things that machines are unable to do yet. Furthermore, human learning approaches can be creative and iterative, allowing for more flexibility and nuance. While machine learning can be used to automate certain tasks, it is not as efficient as human learning when it comes to complex problems and decision-making.",
