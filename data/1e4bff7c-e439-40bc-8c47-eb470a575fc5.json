  "instruction": "Compare and contrast medical bills and credit card debt.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Medical bills and credit card debt are both forms of debt. Both involve borrowing money and expecting repayment with interest. However, medical bills tend to be larger and may include additional cost components such as insurance premiums and co-pays. Credit card debt comes with interest rates that are often much higher than those associated with medical debt. In general, medical debt is not reported to credit bureaus and does not have the same negative impact on credit score as unpaid credit card debt.",
