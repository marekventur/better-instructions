Squeeze a small amount of window cleaner onto a lint-free cloth.\n4. Rub the cloth in a circular motion to spread the cleaner over the window.\n5. Dip a clean cloth or a squeegee into a bucket of clean water to rinse off the cleaner.\n6. Squeegee the water off the window in a single, smooth stroke.\n7. Empty the bucket and repeat steps 5 and 6 until all the soap is gone.\n8. If there are stubborn stains, use a little extra cleaner and scrub them out with a microfiber cloth. \n9.
