  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial intelligence is being used to help combat climate change in a variety of ways. AI-enabled technologies are being used to develop accurate climate models to better understand and predict the effects of climate change. AI is also being used to detect carbon emissions and monitor global energy consumption. AI algorithms are being developed to automatically optimize energy usage, which could reduce energy waste and costs. Finally, AI is being used to develop new and more efficient methods of generating renewable energy.",
