  "output": "Once upon a time there were two cats who decided to go on a grand adventure together. The first cat, named Maru, was brave and daring, while the second cat, named Chaplin, was more of a quiet and thoughtful type. The cats journeyed through forest, meadows, hills, and mountains, and met many interesting creatures along the way. After many days of exploration, the cats finally arrived at a pinnacle peak, where they looked out over the world and felt a sort of freedom they had never felt before. They decided that they would stay together and cherish the adventure they had just been on.",
