  "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants produce energy from sunlight. Through a series of chemical reactions, plants convert carbon dioxide, water and energy from the sun into glucose, a type of sugar, and oxygen. These glucose molecules are then broken down and stored, to be used by the plant for energy and to synthesize other compounds essential for its growth and development.",
