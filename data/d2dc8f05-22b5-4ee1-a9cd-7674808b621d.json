  "output": "Internet addiction can have a number of serious implications for mental, emotional, and physical wellbeing. Research suggests that excessive internet usage can lead to tiredness, insomnia, depression, social isolation, and low self-esteem. Other potential side effects include problems with focus, concentration, and productivity. Children and adolescents who are addicted to the internet are more likely to perform poorly in academics and are at risk of developing learning disabilities. The use of the internet can also lead to an increase in risky behaviors, such as gambling and cyberbullying.",
