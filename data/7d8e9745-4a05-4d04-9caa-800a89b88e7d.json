  "output": "A method to improve engagement during online classes is to incorporate various teaching methods. This could include having interactive sessions such as debates, working in groups, and having small group activities. Students should also be encouraged to read and watch helpful materials and to participate in discussion boards to interact with other students. In addition, teachers can give regular assignments and assessments to keep students motivated. They should also provide rewards and recognition for students who are actively engaged. Furthermore, teachers can introduce tools such as blogs, wikis, and virtual simulations to allow students to express their opinions and creativity.",
