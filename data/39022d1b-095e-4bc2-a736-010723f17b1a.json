  "input": "",
  "output": "A new invention that could help to address the issue of food waste is a smart garbage can. This garbage can would be able to detect when food items are nearing their expiry date, sending reminders to the user when food needs to be consumed or discarded. The garbage can would also be able to monitor the amount of food being thrown away and provide analytics to help the user identify which items are being wasted most often. Finally, the garbage can would have the ability to connect to a grocery delivery service, allowing users to easily purchase food items and reduce their demand for single-use items.",
