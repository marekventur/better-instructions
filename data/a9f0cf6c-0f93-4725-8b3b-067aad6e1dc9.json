  "input": "",
  "output": "Carbon is formed mainly through the fusion of helium nuclei in the cores of stars, which is known as the triple-alpha process. As stars age, they become hotter and denser, increasing the rate of this process. This process releases an enormous amount of energy, which allows a star to shine. As the helium nuclei fuse, they release energetic particles that can hit nearby nuclei and cause them to fuse as well. Carbon is the most common element created in this process, followed by oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements up to iron.",
