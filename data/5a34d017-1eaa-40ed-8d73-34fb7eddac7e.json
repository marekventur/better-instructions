  "input": "New York City",
  "output": "A visit to New York City should include exploring all the unique sites and neighborhoods. A plan should include a mix of activities, such as sightseeing and museum visits, taking in a Broadway show, and trying out different restaurants. \n\nStart in Manhattan by visiting the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. Tour the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Central Park, the American Museum of Natural History, or the Cloisters. Take in a Broadway show or visit the 9/11 Museum and Memorial. \n\nFrom there, explore the other neighborhoods in the city, such as the Upper West Side and Chelsea. Enjoy a day of shopping at Fifth Avenue and visit Chelsea Market. Try unique foods at different restaurants and sample some of the local craft beers. \n\nEnd your trip by visiting Brooklyn and Queens. Enjoy the street art, catch a show at a local music venue or visit a museum. Sample some of the best pizza in the city and take a stroll in Prospect Park. Return to Manhattan for the last night, perhaps to take in the stunning views of the city from a rooftop bar or enjoy the lights of Broadway one last time.",
