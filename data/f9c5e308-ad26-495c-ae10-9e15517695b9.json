  "input": "",
  "output": "Childhood, a time of wonder,\nmemories gently slipping asunder.\nThe laughter, the joy, a simple life of play,\nNo thought of anything to make you sway.\n\nHappiness and joy without a care,\nDreams of happiness, without a single scare.\nA time of innocence, a blissfu state of being,\nThe precious moments that create our deep, lasting meaning.\n\nThe innocence of childhood so pure,\nIt puts a smile on your face for sure.\nSuddenly it's gone, you're in a whirl,\nBut memories of childhood remain in your soul.",
