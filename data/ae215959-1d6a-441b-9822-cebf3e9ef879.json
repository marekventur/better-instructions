  "input": "Credit Card Fraud",
  "output": "A fraud detection algorithm for credit card fraud would ideally involve the following steps:\n\n1. Compile a list of all recent transactions and examine them for any anomalies such as high-value transactions or transactions that were not initiated by the account holder. \n2. Evaluate the spending pattern of the account holder over the past few months to detect any sudden changes. \n3. Validate transactions with the help of geolocation data to ensure that the cardholder is present during the transaction.\n4. Compare the customer's past spending behavior with the recent transactions and check for any significant differences. \n5. Cross-check the billing address provided by the customer with the financial institution's records. \n6. Utilize machine-learning algorithms to detect any abnormal patterns in the user\u2019s spending history, allowing for early detection of any suspicious activity.\n7. Place a temporary block on the card after suspicious activity is detected, and send an alert to the account holder.\n8. Contact the customer for verification and take appropriate action based on the customer's response.",
