  "input": "",
  "output": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-suited for tasks involving image recognition and classification, due to their ability to detect patterns in images. They are composed of multiple layers which allow them to extract features from different levels of the image and create a hierarchical representation. In contrast, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are specialized for tasks involving sequential data, such as natural language processing. They are capable of taking into account the context of the data, making them well-suited for understanding language and making predictions. Both CNNs and RNNs offer similar performance but have different strengths.",
