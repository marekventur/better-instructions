  "input": "",
  "output": "To be a better listener, make an effort to stay engaged by nodding, maintaining eye contact, and asking meaningful questions. For example, when someone is talking, don't just sit quietly. Instead, make a conscious effort to show you are paying attention by making simple acknowledgments such as \"I see\" or \"I understand\". Give the speaker your full attention and make an effort to understand their perspective. This can lead to stronger relationships and better communication.",
