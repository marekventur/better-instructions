  "output": "My regretful heart is heavy, my love fleeting and lost\nNo words I want to whisper, my heart too high a cost\nMy love was so alluring yet left me feeling blue\nFor every memory I cherish was shared not just with you\n\nMy love was strong and pure, so why did I accept defeat?\nMy lone regret, now boundless, I must accept and then repeat\nPerhaps I should have trusted, should have fought for what was mine\nBut the regret of what could have been will be engraved on time.",
