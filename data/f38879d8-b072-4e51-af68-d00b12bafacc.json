  "input": "",
  "output": "No, humans are not necessarily smarter than computers. Computers can process data much faster than humans and can learn from experience in ways that most humans cannot. Computers also have access to a much larger pool of data and have the ability to analyze information in more complex ways than humans. However, humans have unique abilities such as creativity, abstract thinking, and the ability to think emotionally that computers may never be able to replicate. As such, it is difficult to say that humans are smarter than computers.",
