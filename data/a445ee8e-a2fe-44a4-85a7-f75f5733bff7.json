  "output": "Create an outdoor scavenger hunt that anyone can enjoy! Start by creating a list of items for participants to find and collect. The list could include items such as leaves, sticks, rocks and flowers. Make sure to add some interesting items like pine cones, feathers or items with special colors. Provide participants with a bag to put their found items and set a certain amount of time for them to complete the hunt. Give participants a few clues to help them find the items and when the time is up, they should look at all the items they found and see if they completed the scavenger hunt!",
