  "instruction": "Write a paragraph summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of using renewable energy sources in our daily life.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The benefits of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro and geothermal energy are numerous. These sources are naturally replenished and affordable, thus creating a more secure energy supply with less environmental pollution than with traditional fossil fuels. Furthermore, it helps to reduce the amount of fossil fuel that must be used to meet energy needs. On the downside, renewable energy sources rely heavily on two particular factors: the availability of the resources and the degree of technological development. Additionally, certain renewable energy sources such as biomass can sometimes lead to deforestation and habitat destruction. In conclusion, although renewable energy sources have certain drawbacks, their overall benefits outweigh the negatives as they help to reduce draining of natural resources and minimize the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.",
