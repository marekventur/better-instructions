  "input": "",
  "output": "The three laws of classical mechanics, also known as Newton's three laws of motion, are: (1) Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it; (2) Acceleration is produced when a net force is applied to an object; (3) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. These laws form the foundation of modern physics.",
