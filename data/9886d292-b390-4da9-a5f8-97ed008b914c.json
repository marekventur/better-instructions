  "output": "A creative way to show appreciation to a good friend is to make them a personalized gift. The gift can be tailored to something they will enjoy and that reflects how much they mean to you. This can include anything from a handmade card, a framed photo of a shared moment, a book with a personalized message, or a handmade item that reflects their interests. It can even be something with a larger emotional significance, like a symbolic token or a box with a precise selection of items special to your friend.",
