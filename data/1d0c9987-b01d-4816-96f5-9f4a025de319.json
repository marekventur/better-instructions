  "output": "Nanotechnology has had a major impact on medical treatments. It has enabled the development of drug delivery systems, implants, and medical devices that are more effective at delivering treatments, in many cases with fewer side effects. Scientists are also using nanotechnology to develop treatments for illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, and infectious diseases by targeting specific cells or molecules to improve the efficacy of treatment.",
