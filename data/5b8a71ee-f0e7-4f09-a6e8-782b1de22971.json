  "instruction": "Design an experiment to test the ability of GPT models to natural language understanding.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The experiment should involve giving GPT models a set of natural language tasks and evaluating their performance. These tasks can involve classification, open-ended generation, comprehension, and editing. The tasks should involve a mix of short-answer and essay-style questions with varying levels of complexity. Examples of possible tasks could include: translating a sentence, rewriting a sentence to make it grammatically correct, generating a description for a picture, or answering a multiple-choice question about a given passage. The tasks should be designed so that the output of GPT models is easily determinable. The evaluation should also consider other aspects like fluency, readability, and grammatical correctness.",
