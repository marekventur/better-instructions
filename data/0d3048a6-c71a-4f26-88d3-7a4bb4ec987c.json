  "output": "I woke up this morning, so early it was still night \nMy coffee was steaming, it gave off a delight \nI sipped it somewhat slowly, savoring every sip \nThe coffee was so sweet, I started to flip \n\nThe streets were so quiet, cars like muffled thumps \nI felt so content, I had no need for trumpets or trumpets \nThe birds sang melodies, in harmony about the sky \nMy heart was filled with joy, on this day I couldn't deny \n\nThen I looked down, wondering what I could find \nIt was a four-leaf clover, a symbol that's so kind \nAmidst it all, I felt nothing was amiss \nMy heart was so full of gratitude, I had no need for wish",
