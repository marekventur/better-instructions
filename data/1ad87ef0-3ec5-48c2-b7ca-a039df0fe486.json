  "output": "An algorithm to detect fake news in articles could include the following steps:\n\n1. Collect the articles to be evaluated\n2. Create fingerprints for each article by evaluating the structure of the article, extracting factual statements, and fact-checking these statements with reliable sources. \n3. Use machine learning or natural language processing algorithms to identify and classify any deceptive narratives or language.\n4. If a false article is detected, report the result to the user and take steps to discredit the article.",
