  "instruction": "Design an experiment to test the effectiveness of a new type of tires.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The experiment should involve two cars with identical model, features and engine specifications. The cars should both drive on the same track and road conditions for the same amount of time. One car should be fitted with the new tires, while the other car should be fitted with the traditional tires. The effectiveness of the new tires should be measured by the driving performance, fuel efficiency and road grip.",
