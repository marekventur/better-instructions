Examples of his work include \"The Persistence of Memory\" (1931), which depict melting clocks; \"The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory\" (1952-54); and \"Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening\" (1944). His work is known for its use of vibrant colors and surrealistic elements, and continues to influence today's art scene.",
