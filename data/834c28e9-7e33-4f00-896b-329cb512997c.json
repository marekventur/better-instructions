  "instruction": "Generate a short story which is based on the following prompt.",
  "input": "A teenage girl, who is unbelievably good at hacky-sack and fixes her friends' problems by providing tech support",
  "output": "Elizabeth had a special talent for hacky-sack. There was something about the way she twirled the sack between her fingers, the way she glided around the others with her rhythmic gymnastics, that set her apart. When she strung together an impressive sequence of moves, mastering a skill that others had been struggling with, her friends couldn't help but cheer her on.\n\nBut it wasn't just hacky-sack that made Elizabeth so extraordinary. She also had a knack for tech support. Whenever a friend had a technical issue, Elizabeth would be the one they sought out for help. She had a quick mind and an uncanny way of getting to the root of the matter. In no time at all, she'd be able to figure out the issue and provide a simple solution. It was almost as if she was born to be a tech guru.\n\nThough her talent in hacky-sack and technical matters were just two of her many gifts, these were the ones Elizabeth shared most openly with her friends. All it took was a few quick rounds of the hacky-sack or a few words of technical wisdom, and the bonds that held her friendships together would grow even stronger.",
