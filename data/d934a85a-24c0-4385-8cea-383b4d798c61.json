  "input": "",
  "output": "A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that convert an input of arbitrary size into a fixed-size output known as a 'hash value' or 'digest'. It is a one-way process, meaning that it is impossible to recover the input from the output hash value. Hash functions are used for tasks such as cryptography, data integrity, and adding security to password authentication systems.",
