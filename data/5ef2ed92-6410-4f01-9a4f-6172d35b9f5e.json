  "input": "\"The woods are lovely, dark and deep, \n\nBut I have promises to keep, \n\nAnd miles to go before I sleep, \n\nAnd miles to go before I sleep.\"",
  "output": "The poem \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\" by Robert Frost is a reflection on the beauty and temporary nature of life. The tone of the poem is contemplative and melancholic, as the speaker contemplates their own mortality and the futility of trying to make lasting marks in life. The poem's themes are mortality, promises, and beauty in the face of death. The speaker is reminded of their duty to keep promises and of how futile their life's endeavors will be in the grand scheme of things. The poem ultimately conveys a message of fragility and the peace that can be found in embracing death and the beauty of life.",
