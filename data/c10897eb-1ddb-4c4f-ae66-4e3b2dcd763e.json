  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amber. She was very curious and adventurous and loved learning new things. One day, while playing in the park, Amber made an amazing discovery - a robot! \n\nShe was amazed by the robot's bright lights, whirring sound and its shiny metal body. She asked the robot all sorts of questions but the robot kept silent, it didn't seem to understand any of Amber's questions. Amber got a bit disappointed but then had an idea. \n\nShe ran back home and grabbed some apples, oranges and other goodies and took them back to the park to share with the robot. She gave the robot the treats and the robot finally came to life, smiling, and even answering some of Amber's questions! They talked and talked until the sun set and it was time for Amber to go home. She left feeling very happy that she had made a new friend. \n\nThe next day and every day after, Amber visited the robot, bringing it more treats, and learning more and more about the robot's world. They were the best of friends.",
