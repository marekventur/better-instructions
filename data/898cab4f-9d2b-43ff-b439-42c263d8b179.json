  "output": "The five most common plants found in a desert include sagebrush, cacti, Joshua tree, desert grasses, and creosote bush. Sagebrush grows in the driest areas and it's a shrub that has a strong smell. Cacti come in hundreds of different species, they have no leaves and are great at storing water. Joshua tree is a yucca plant, it has fan-like leaves and a tall central stem. Desert grasses have deep roots so they can help prevent soil erosion. Finally, the creosote bush is a common shrub in deserts, it has small yellow flowers and gray-green foliage.",
