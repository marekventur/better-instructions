  "instruction": "Explain how two-factor authentication works.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security that requires two methods of verification to log into an account. It combines something you know (such as a password) with something you have (something physical, like a phone or an authentication key). When 2FA is set up, a user will be asked to enter their username and password, then a unique code will be sent via text message or generated by an authentication app to their device. Only when they enter this code will they be allowed to access the account.",
