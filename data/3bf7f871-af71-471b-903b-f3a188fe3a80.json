  "output": "A plan to reduce electricity usage in a home can include a number of different strategies. These include replacing inefficient lightbulbs with energy-efficient LEDs, unplugging appliances and electronics when not in use, using natural light instead of electric lights where possible, using a touch-free faucet to reduce water heater use, using a smart thermostat to monitor and adjust temperatures automatically, installing a solar hot water heater, and turning off electronics when not in use. Additionally, making sure to install and seal windows and doors correctly to reduce air leakage can also help reduce electricity usage.",
