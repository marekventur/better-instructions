  "output": "Wolf is walking through the forest when he meets a friendly bee. The bee greets him and invites him to follow him to a secret garden. As they fly through the air, Wolf can't help but marvel at the beauty of nature around him. They eventually arrive at the garden, which turns out to be even more spectacular than Wolf imagined. The sky is bright blue, the flowers are colourful and fragrant, and the humming of the bees fills the air. Wolf can't believe his eyes - this place is incredible. He can't help but smile as he takes it all in. The bee lets him explore and Wolf spends the whole day discovering the wonders of the secret garden. He finally leaves as the sun sets, full of joy and wonder at what he's experienced.",
