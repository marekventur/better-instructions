  "instruction": "Design a transportation system to reduce emissions in a city",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A transportation system to reduce emissions in a city should focus on providing citizens with a variety of public transportation options. Buses, light rail, and electric bicycles can replace cars and help reduce emissions. The system should also focus on increasing pedestrian and cyclist paths to encourage more people to use more sustainable transportation. Furthermore, the city can invest in intelligent traffic lights that prioritize green transport, allowing buses and shared vehicles to pass through congested areas, while private cars are redirected to off-peak times.",
