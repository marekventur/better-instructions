  "instruction": "Compare and contrast the decision evaluation processes for a small business and a large corporation.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "A small business typically has a shorter decision evaluation process compared to a large corporation. For a small business, the decision evaluation process may only involve a small number of key stakeholders, such as the company\u2019s owner or founders. Furthermore, because the business is small, these stakeholders usually have access to all the information they need to make informed decisions, and the entire process can be completed quickly. In contrast, a large corporation typically has a much more complex and lengthy decision evaluation process. The process typically involves numerous stakeholders across multiple departments, each with their own set of information, which often makes it more difficult to reach consensus. Furthermore, due to the organizational structure of large corporations, decision-making can be slow.",
