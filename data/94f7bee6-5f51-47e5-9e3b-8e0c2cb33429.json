  "input": "",
  "output": "The fishing industry has a large environmental impact. Overfishing depletes fish stock, leading to decreased biodiversity and ecosystem disruption. Pollution from boats and fishing equipment can contaminate the water, damaging habitats and the organisms that live in them. Aquaculture can increase water pollution and spread invasive species, while fishing gear such as nets and lines can entangle, injure, and kill marine wildlife.",
