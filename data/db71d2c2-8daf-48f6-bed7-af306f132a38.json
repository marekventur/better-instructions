  "input": "",
  "output": "The philosophical debate of free will in the face of determinism centers around the idea that the universe is an orderly and predictable place, and whatever happens is the result of a trigger and chain of events already set in motion. Despite this, many believe that we are still able to make choices that are based on our own free will. \n\nOne argument suggests that free will does exist, as our actions are a product of what we choose to do with the limited set of information available to us. As individuals, we still have the right to make decisions and act according to what we know, even if a deterministic system exists. Alternatively, others argue that while we are part of a universal system, the choices we make are based on the lens of our unique perspective and the biases that come with it. Ultimately, the answer to this debate largely depends on individual beliefs.",
