  "input": "",
  "output": "It is clear that computer science classes should be made available in more schools. This is due to the digital nature of the world we live in. In recent years, technology has advanced to such an extent that almost every industry relies heavily on digital tools and digital platforms. Those who are not familiar with the basics of how computers and digital technology work are at a great disadvantage because they will lack the skills that can help make them successful in the workplace. Additionally, lack of knowledge of computers and digital technology can limit a person's access to new opportunities and experiences, such as online education and entertainment. By offering computer science classes in schools, students will be exposed to these important skills and be better prepared for their future career paths.",
