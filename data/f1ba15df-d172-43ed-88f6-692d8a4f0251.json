  "input": "",
  "output": "The most obvious difference between owls and hawks is in their physical appearance. Owls are typically characterized by a round facial disk, large eyes and a downward curved beak. Hawks, on the other hand, have a more narrow and pointed beak, small eyes and a less prominent facial disk. Owls are mostly nocturnal while hawks are diurnal. Owls use their facial disk to collect sound from their environment to locate prey while hawks can spot their prey from high altitudes. Owls hunt by stealth whereas hawks hunt by surprise. Owls primarily feed on small mammals, insects and birds, while hawks feed on larger prey such as reptiles and rodents.",
