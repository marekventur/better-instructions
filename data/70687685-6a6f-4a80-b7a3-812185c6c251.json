  "instruction": "Select one genetically modified organism and describe its advantages and disadvantages.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "One example of a genetically modified organism is Bt corn. Bt corn has been engineered to produce an insecticide in its tissues, helping farmers reduce insect damage to their crops. It also has been modified to resist certain herbicides, allowing farmers to target specific weeds. One of the advantages of Bt corn is that it can produce higher yields of higher quality grain. Additionally, use of insecticide on the crops can be reduced, reducing the environmental impact and potential health risks associated with pesticide use. However, one disadvantage of Bt corn is that pests may develop resistance to the insecticide, making Bt corn less effective over time. Additionally, there is potential environmental impact from the disruption of natural insect populations.",
