  "input": "A stitch in time saves nine.",
  "output": "This proverb means that taking preventive measures to solve a problem when it is small can save time and effort in the future. For example, if a person takes the time and effort to fix a minor issue in their life now, they may be able to save themselves from having to deal with a major problem in the future. This is applicable to many aspects of modern life, such as taking the time to maintain a healthy lifestyle or developing certain skills early on.",
