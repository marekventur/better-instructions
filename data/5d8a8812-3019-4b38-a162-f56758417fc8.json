  "input": "",
  "output": "For a casual business meeting, clothing should be neat and well-fitting, but not too casual. Men can typically wear dress shirt with khakis, or a polo shirt and slacks, for example. Women generally can wear dress shirt and skirt, nice pants, or a dress. Additionally, appropriate shoes and accessories are necessary, such as dress shoes and a belt for men, and low-heel dress shoes and minimal jewelry for women.",
