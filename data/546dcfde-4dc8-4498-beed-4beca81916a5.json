  "output": "The city of Toronto is facing an environmental issue due to human activities, particulary in terms of air pollution. The city has seen an increase in vehicle traffic, leading to industrial, vehicular and construction pollution. This pollution has the potential to have negative effects on human health, wildlife and the environment. Additionally, increasing urbanization in the city contributes significantly to air pollution, as well as water and noise pollution. This has the potential to cause a decline in air quality, soil water and wildlife habitats.",
