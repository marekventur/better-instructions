  "input": "",
  "output": "Vector notation is a way of representing a quantity that has both size and direction. For example, a toss of a ball can be represented as a vector because it has a certain speed, direction, and distance. The vector is written as an arrow, with the direction of the arrow representing the direction of the toss, and the length of the arrow representing the distance the ball traveled.",
