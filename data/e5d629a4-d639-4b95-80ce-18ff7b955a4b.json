  "output": "Natural selection is the process by which organisms adapt and evolve over time in response to changes in their environment. It is driven by the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d principle, where those individuals with more desirable traits are more likely to reproduce and pass their genes onto the next generation, while those with less desirable traits perish. Over time, this leads to the development of new species which are better suited to the environment. Artificial selection, on the other hand, involves humans directly selecting which organisms are able to reproduce. Unlike natural selection, this is a conscious decision where humans selectively choose which organisms gain reproductive advantages. This is done in order to produce organisms with a desired trait or characteristic, such as larger fruits or better yields. Both natural and artificial selection are important processes that have allowed us to shape the world and its organisms as we know it.",
