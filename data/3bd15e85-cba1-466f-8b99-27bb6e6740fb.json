  "output": "Schrodinger's wave equation is an equation in quantum mechanics that describes how a quantum system changes over time. It is based on wave equations and describes the behavior of subatomic particles that have wave-like properties; these particles include electrons, protons, and more. The wave equation's solutions represent wave functions which can be used to determine the probability of a particle's position and momentum, as well as its energy. The equation also relates the properties of a particle to its position in space and time.",
