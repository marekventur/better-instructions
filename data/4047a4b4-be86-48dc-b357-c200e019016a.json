  "output": "Heat transfer is the movement of thermal energy in the form of heat from one location to another. The transfer can take place between two bodies, such as between a hot object and a cold one, or between a hot object and its environment. Heat transfer can happening through several mechanisms, such as radiation, conduction, convection, or a combination of these. Conduction is heat transfer through matter when substances are in direct contact with each other, while convection is heat transfer due to the motion of fluids, such as air or water. Radiation is heat transfer that occurs without physical contact and is the only way heat can be transferred through a vacuum.",
