  "input": "",
  "output": "The process of filing a restraining order depends on the state, but generally involves filling out paperwork and filing it with the court. The paperwork needs to specify the relationship between the victim and perpetrator, as well as the behaviors requested to be restricted. The victim will then need to attend a court hearing, where the judge will decide whether to grant the restraining order. Once a restraining order is filed, the victim will need to be aware of the restrictions and notify the court of any violations.",
