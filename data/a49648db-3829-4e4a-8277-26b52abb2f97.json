  "input": "",
  "output": "Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing data or selecting the most relevant features from a given dataset. This can improve the accuracy of a machine learning model by providing more relevant or predictive features. By creating more complex and meaningful features, the model is better able to identify and analyze patterns and relationships in the data. Additionally, feature engineering can reduce the complexity of the model and make it more interpretable.",
