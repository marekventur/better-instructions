  "input": "",
  "output": "To increase the number of customers at a store, I would suggest a three-tiered system. The first step would be to create an online presence. This could include a website and social media accounts where the store advertises its products and services. Additionally, this online presence should be updated regularly to inform customers of new items and any limited time specials.\n\nThe second step would be to implement a loyalty rewards system which offers customers points and discounts for each purchase. This allows customers to save money and feel appreciated for returning to the store. \n\nFinally, the store can increase its customer base by engaging in promotional campaigns and offering special discounts. The store can send out emails and social media posts announcing specials or providing information on discounts and limited time offers. This will encourage customers to make a purchase.",
