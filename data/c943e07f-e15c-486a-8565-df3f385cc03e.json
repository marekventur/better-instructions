  "input": "",
  "output": "A privilege is a special right that is granted to some people, but not to all. It is typically exclusive to a certain social, economic, or political class, such as the wealthy or the elite. Privileges can include benefits or access to certain resources that are unavailable to others. Since these privileges are not available to everyone, those who are privileged are able to gain advantage and benefit from the inequities in a system.",
