  "instruction": "What goes up must come down. Explain this proverb to me.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "This proverb is a reminder of the universal law of gravity - that everything which rises must eventually come back down again. It's a reminder of the finite nature of worldly pleasures, that ultimately no matter how high we may climb, we have to come back down to Earth and face reality. It can also be interpreted as an encouragement to remain grounded and focused no matter how successful we become in life.",
