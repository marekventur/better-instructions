  "output": "A decision tree is a graphical representation of the decision-making process. It consists of nodes that represent decisions, branches that represent possible outcomes of those decisions, and leaves that represent the end result. A decision tree starts with the main decision and branches out into a series of other decisions that eventually lead to a conclusion. Each branch in a decision tree can be further split into other decisions, and the end result of each branch is determined by the outcome of its predecessors.",
