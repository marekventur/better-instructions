  "instruction": "Brainstorm three possible outcomes of the following policy proposal:",
  "input": "A policy proposal to create a minimum wage increase for all workers.",
  "output": "The three possible outcomes of this policy proposal include an increased cost of living, with companies having to pay more for supplies and staff to account for the increased wages; increased consumer spending, as working-class people gain more buying power; and an increase in social and economic inequality, as those in the highest income brackets may be able to absorb the cost of the wage increase while those in the lowest income brackets may suffer due to being unable to absorb the cost.",
