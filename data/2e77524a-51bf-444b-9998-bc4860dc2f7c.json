  "input": "",
  "output": "I would create a collection that emphasizes wearable fashion and modern silhouettes. I would design garments that are both classic and daring, striking a balance between trend and timelessness. Fabrics such as silk, velvet and cashmere would be used to create jackets, trousers, skirts and blouses with unique prints and details. My overall goal is to create something that is both edgy and wearable.",
