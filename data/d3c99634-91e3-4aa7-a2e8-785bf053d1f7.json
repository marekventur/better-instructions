  "input": "sum = 0\nfor i in range(len(num_list)\nsum = sum + num_list[i]",
  "output": "This code is incorrect because the code is missing a closing bracket at the end of the for loop. The correct syntax would be \"for i in range(len(num_list))\". This syntax ensures that the loop executes the correct number of times, depending on the size of the num_list. Without the closing bracket, the loop will not execute any instructions and will result in an error.",
