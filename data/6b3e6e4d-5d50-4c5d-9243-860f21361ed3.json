  "input": "",
  "output": "Mitochondrial Eve is the name given to the most recent common ancestor of all living humans. It is believed that she lived around 200,000 years ago and her mitochondrial DNA has been passed down to every human in the world today. Mitochondrial Eve is a genetic universal ancestor, meaning that her mitochondrial DNA was passed down to everyone, regardless of language or culture. This makes her unique among humans, as all people share a connection with her. Mitochondrial Eve is particularly important to scientists as it has provided insight into the development of human evolution, migration patterns, and interbreeding events. In addition to being a universal ancestor, Mitochondrial Eve has also been utilized to trace ancestry and identify family relationships. Thus, she serves as an important milestone in human history.",
