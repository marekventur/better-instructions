  "output": "A eerie and tense background music with gradually increasing sound effects, drums, and strings. A sequence of loud chords and cymbals, punctuated by an occasional note on a flute or electronic instrument. An ominous, rising tempo, continuously building up to an all-encompassing, climactic sound. Periodically, a deep, low bass reverberates and gradually rises in intensity, conveying a sense of fear and anticipation.",
