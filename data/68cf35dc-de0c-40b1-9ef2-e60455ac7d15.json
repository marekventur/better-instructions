  "input": "",
  "output": "Back Propagation is an algorithm used in training feed-forward neural networks, which are networks that use multiple layers of neurons and artificial neurons with synapses between them in order to process input signals and generate output. Back Propagation involves calculating the errors in each of the neurons in the network and then adjusting the weights of each of the synapses and neurons accordingly in order to reduce the overall error rate and improve the accuracy of the network. This process is repeated until the desired accuracy is achieved. The algorithm is used in supervised learning and supervised deep learning applications, such as classification and image recognition.",
