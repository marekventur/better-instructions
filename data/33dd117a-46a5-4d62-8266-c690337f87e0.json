  "input": "",
  "output": "Albert Einstein's theory of relativity is significant because it revolutionized our understanding of the universe. It replaced the centuries-old notion of absolute space and time with the concept of spacetime, allowing us to understand phenomena such as gravitational waves, black holes, and the expansion of the universe. It also opened the door to advances in physics that weren't possible before, such as more powerful rockets and more precise experiments in particle physics.",
