  "output": "Carbohydrates are a class of molecules that contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically in a ratio of 1:2:1. They are found in many foods and can be either monosaccharides, disaccharides, or polysaccharides. Monosaccharides are simple sugars, such as glucose and fructose, while disaccharides are double sugars, such as sucrose and lactose. Polysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules, such as starch, glycogen, and cellulose. Carbohydrates are an important source of energy for the body.",
