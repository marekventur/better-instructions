  "input": "",
  "output": "A comprehensive training program should focus on enhancing the executive's communication skills, both written and verbal, while also increasing their understanding of and appreciation for the cultural nuances of different contexts. The program should include modules on developing one's personal brand, networking, storytelling, and public speaking. Training should also include specific tactics for giving feedback, providing guidance, and inspiring others. Additionally, to help ensure long-term effectiveness, a follow-up program should be designed that allows executives to practice the skills they have learned.",
