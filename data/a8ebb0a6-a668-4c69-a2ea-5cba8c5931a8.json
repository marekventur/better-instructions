  "output": "Cloud computing is like renting a car; you have access to a powerful vehicle and can use it as you please, but you don't own the car and will have to eventually return it. On-premises computing is like owning your own vehicle; you have control over the vehicle, can make any changes you want, and you don't have to give it back.",
