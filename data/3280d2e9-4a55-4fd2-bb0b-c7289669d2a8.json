  "input": "The scientific method is a cyclical process that requires multiple steps in order to properly test a hypothesis. The process begins with an observation, then progresses to forming a hypothesis, designing an experiment to test the hypothesis, collecting and analyzing data, and drawing a conclusion that either confirms or rejects the hypothesis. After the conclusion is drawn, further research may be conducted to validate the results and make improvements to the experiment.",
