  "input": "",
  "output": "A creative way to show appreciation for someone is to send them a heartfelt handwritten letter. Take some time to reflect on the things that person does for you and think about how your life would be different without them. Writing it out will allow you to express your appreciation in words and show just how much the person means to you. You can also accompany the letter with a small gift, like a bouquet of flowers, which will show the person that you are thankful for their presence in your life.",
