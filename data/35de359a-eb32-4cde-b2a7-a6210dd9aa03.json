They use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to detect and interpret users' intents, and respond with relevant information and automated actions. AI Assistants are widely used in a variety of digital products, such as everyday consumer devices, automated customer service agents, and digital health assistants. These digital assistants strive to provide a comfortable, conversational experience, mimicking the speech and behavior of a regular human assistant.
