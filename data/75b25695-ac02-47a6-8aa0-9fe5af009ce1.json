  "input": "",
  "output": "The Devil Wears Prada is an entertaining, light-hearted comedy that follows the story of Andy Sachs as she navigates her way through the intimidating and often ridiculous corporate world of fashion. Starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway, the movie follows Andy's journey as she starts off an inexperienced and naive intern and grows into a confident, competent professional. The movie follows the usual tropes of workplace comedies, but with a modern twist that makes it fresh and entertaining. It is a must-watch movie that will make you laugh while making you appreciate the power of hard work and perseverance.",
