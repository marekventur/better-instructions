  "output": "Once upon a time there was a boy named Tom who lived in a small town. Tom was an ordinary boy, nothing special about him from the outside. However, Tom had a special power, he had the ability to make his fantasies come to life by using his words. Whenever he used his power, his reality would blend with a new fantasy world, filled with dragons, wizards and magical creatures. On his 16th birthday, Tom's parents gave him a magical artifact, a wand, that allowed him to control his fantasies and make them fit into the real world. Tom explored his new-found power and found out he could use it for the greater good. Tom set off on a quest to do what he could to help the world with his magical wand and the fantasies he could conjure up from his imagination.",
