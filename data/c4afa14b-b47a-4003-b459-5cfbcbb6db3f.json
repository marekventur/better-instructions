  "output": "The Lost City of Petra is an ancient city located in present-day Jordan that is believed to have been established as early as 312 BCE by the Nabataean Arabs. The city was an important hub for trade and an architectural marvel, featuring structures carved from the solid rock of the surrounding mountains. The city declined in importance with the rise of new trade routes, and was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.",
