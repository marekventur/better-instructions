  "output": "I would develop a mobile game based on an animal called \u201cAnimal Park\u201d. The goal of the game is to create and manage a park full of different animals. Players can choose different species of animals and explore the park by taking care of their animals and engaging in activities such as feeding, petting, and playing mini games with them. The players can also make use of different decorations for the park and invite their friends to visit. The game also provides educational facts about each animal species, introducing players to the fascinating world of wildlife.",
