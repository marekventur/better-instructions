  "input": "",
  "output": "People\u2019s lives can take an unexpected twist and turn due to the choices they make. Take John, for example. He was an engineering student with no interest in partying. But one night he decided to join his friends on a night of revelry, and ended up risking his friendship with his best friend when he cheated on Rachel with the new girl at school. Later on, he dropped out of school in order to provide financial support for his family. Even though he was able to turn things around and learn new skills in sales, he had to pay a heavy price for his misadventures \u2014 the loss of his lifelong dream to become an engineer. This story serves as a reminder that every choice carries with it consequences, and that it is important for people to consider them before making a decision.",
