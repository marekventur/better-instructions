  "output": "Creatures of the sea, swimming so happily, \nAll around me so much life, with so much to see. \nColors of blue and green, a beauty so serene, \nFrom sharks that glide to a school of tiny fish. \n\nA seahorse on sand, a starfish takes a stand, \nThe coral below a rainbow like no other. \nWonderous news fishes, always free to choose, \nExploring the depths, such a terrific view. \n\nThe beauty of the sea, vast and wild, \nThe waves that crash, a joy for every child, \nThe mystery of depths, now so unknown, \nWe can only hope that this beauty will never be shown.",
