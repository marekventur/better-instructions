  "input": "Process: Photosynthesis.",
  "output": "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy, typically from the sun, into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the organisms' activities. It takes place in two stages \u2014 light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle \u2014 and uses carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, water from the soil, and light to produce energy-rich molecules such as glucose and oxygen. The light-dependent reactions convert energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in molecules such as NADPH and ATP. These molecules are then used in the Calvin cycle to produce glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide. This process is essential for life on earth, as it provides energy for plants and animals.",
