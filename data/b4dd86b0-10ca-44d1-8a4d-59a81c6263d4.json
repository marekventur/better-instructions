  "input": "",
  "output": "For a small business, an effective cyber security system requires both prevention and reaction. Prevention measures should include regular policy audits and reviews, frequent patching of all computers and other equipment, user training, and regular penetration testing. To detect potential intrusions and other security issues, the company should deploy intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and data loss prevention software. Finally, the system must also include clear reactions and responses to any threats that are detected. This should include a well-defined chain of command to respond to any alert, and documentation on how data breaches should be handled. \n\nTo ensure the covers all bases, the system should also involve outside experts in cybersecurity to conduct assessments and offer advice on best practices. An outside IT department or consultant should be responsible for managing the system, with regular reviews to ensure that it is up to date and relevant. Setting up a remote access and logging system for employees can also help to maintain the security of the network and data. Finally, all data should be stored in a secure network and encrypted whenever possible.",
