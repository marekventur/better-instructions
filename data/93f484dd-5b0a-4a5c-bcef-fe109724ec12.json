  "instruction": "Create a plan to reduce household budget by 10%.",
  "input": "Total household budget is $2,000",
  "output": "One way to reduce your household budget by 10% is to look for ways to cut back on non-essential spending. This may include taking public transportation instead of driving your own car, cutting back on dining out, reducing/eliminating cable or other subscription services, and shopping around for the best deals on necessities such as groceries and household items. You may also want to look into making some home improvements to lower utility bills. Additionally, you could look into refinancing your mortgage to a lower interest rate, or negotiate lower interest rates on your credit cards.",
