  "input": "",
  "output": "A virus-scanning program should first create an inventory of the files stored on a computer. It should then use various definitions and signature-based scanning techniques to detect known viruses in the files. In addition, the program can employ heuristic-based scanning techniques to detect suspicious activities and block any malicious code. Finally, it should provide a detailed report on the viruses found, if any.",
