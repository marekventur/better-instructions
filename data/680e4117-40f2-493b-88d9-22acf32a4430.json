  "input": "Emotions: Anger and disappointment",
  "output": "My anger and disappointment are like wildfire,\nBurning up my soul like a blazing pyre.\nMy heart is aching and my spirit torn,\nAs I fall into a deep abyss of scorn.\n\nMy world is collapsing around me,\nDestroying everything I used to see.\nNo matter how hard I try,\nI'm disappointed and I just want to cry.\n\nMy vision is dark and full of fear,\nAnd no matter what my path is unclear.\nBut I must dig deep and persevere,\nAnd turn my anger into courage and cheer.",
