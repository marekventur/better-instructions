  "output": "Once upon a time, there lived a little mouse and a wise old elephant. The mouse was scurrying around in the jungle looking for food when it stumbled upon an acorn. The mouse was very excited and was about to take off when the elephant noticed it. The elephant asked the mouse why it was so interested in the acorn and the mouse told him of its plans to hoard the acorn away. The wise old elephant offered some advice - that it was important to share what they had with the other animals, and he taught the mouse how to plant and grow the acorn. And so, with the elephant's help, the mouse, the elephant, and all the other animals shared in the bounty of the growing acorns.",
