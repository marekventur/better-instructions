  "output": "Once upon a time, there was a family of birds that packed up their sacks and set off on a journey to the lake. As they flew through the sky, they chatted excitedly amongst themselves and watched the landscape pass by beneath them. Once they arrived at the lake, they were in awe of its beauty. The crystal blue waters reflected the sun's rays and the surrounding hills were luscious and green. \n\nThe birds decided to take a dip in the water and have an adventure. They dove and splashed around, exploring the depths of the lake and appreciating the refreshing coolness. As the night fell, they all gathered around a crackling campfire, roasting marshmallows and telling stories of their own. Eventually, the birds returned home, happy and exhausted from their fun-filled vacation.",
