  "input": "",
  "output": "AI is playing an increasingly important role in healthcare, from automating labor-intensive tasks to aiding in the treatment of diseases. AI can help healthcare professionals diagnose and treat patients more quickly and accurately, as well as detect potential medical problems earlier on. AI tools can also be used to monitor patients remotely and provide them with personalized medical advice. In addition, AI can help researchers to develop new drugs and treatments more quickly, and can even one day be used to automate the entire clinical process from diagnosis to treatment.",
