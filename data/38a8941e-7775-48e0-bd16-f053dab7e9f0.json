  "input": "",
  "output": "The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be converted from one form to another, but the total amount of energy remains constant within a system. The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy in an isolated system always increases over time. The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.",
