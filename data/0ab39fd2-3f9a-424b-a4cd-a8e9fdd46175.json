  "output": "A computer is an electronic machine comprised of many components that interacts with a user through a set of instructions and is able to perform a variety of functions. It is made up of three primary components\u2014input and output devices (like a keyboard, mouse and monitor), storage (such as a hard drive) and a processor (a processor and memory combo). \n\nThe processor is the device that does all the work, receiving and interpreting commands for the computer to perform. It understands the instructions given by the user and translates them into commands that can be executed by the computer. \n\nThe computer stores data and instructions in memory, which is made up of numerous small chips. When a user performs a task on the computer, the processor retrieves the data and instructions from the memory to execute the task. \n\nThe computer also consists of input and output devices that allow the computer to communicate with the user. Input devices (like a keyboard, mouse and microphone) allow users to provide instructions to the computer; output devices (like a monitor and speakers) allow it to provide information to the user.\n\nA computer is able to perform millions of calculations in a fraction of a second, making it one of the most powerful and versatile tools in the world.",
