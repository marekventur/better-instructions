  "output": "One significant figure in Asian history is Confucius, a Chinese philosopher and teacher who became a leading figure in Chinese culture during the Spring and Autumn period. His teachings, collected in the Analects, focused on interpersonal relationships, morality, and justice. He is credited with popularizing the Golden Rule, which states that one should \"do to others what one would want done to oneself,\" and he encouraged people to put others' interests before their own. His teachings had a profound effect upon Chinese thought and the culture at large, and his teachings continue to influence public policy today.",
