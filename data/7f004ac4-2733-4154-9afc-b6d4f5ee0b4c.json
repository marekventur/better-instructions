  "input": "",
  "output": "Function composition is a programming technique in which two or more functions are combined to create a new, combined function. It is a way of writing a single expression that performs multiple operations in a given order. The idea is to compose a complex operation from simpler ones, by combining multiple functions together. By using function composition, it is possible to create a single, powerful expression which can perform a sequence of operations that are otherwise too complicated to be written in a single line of code.",
