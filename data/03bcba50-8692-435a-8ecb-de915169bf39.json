  "input": "",
  "output": "My design for a pair of sneakers features a modern-classic style with some contemporary touches. An upper made of suede and mesh, with the mesh playing a more prominent role to provide breathability, while the suede gives it a sophisticated and timeless look. The laces are made of recycled materials, with eyelets along their length and metal tips at the ends to make them more resilient. The collar is cushioned for comfort, with an ankle strap for a secure fit. The sole is made of durable rubber and features flex grooves for improved cushioning, providing excellent grip and traction on a variety of surfaces.",
