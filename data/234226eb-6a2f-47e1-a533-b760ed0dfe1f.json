  "instruction": "Explain the consequences of an increase in the money supply.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "An increase in the money supply can lead to more spending, rising prices, and an increase in inflation. As the money supply increases, the value of each individual dollar is decreased, which leads people to spend more, as it takes more money to buy the same products. This leads to rising prices, meaning that goods and services cost more. Higher prices form a continued cycle as people continue to spend more as the money supply increases, leading to inflation.",
