  "output": "A strategy for reducing stress includes consistent self-care, staying organized, and setting boundaries. Self-care includes getting enough sleep and eating nutritious foods, spending time outdoors, and engaging in activities like yoga or meditation. Staying organized can help reduce stress by providing an sense of control and accomplishment; by organizing a workspace, tracking tasks, and breaking down larger tasks into achievable goals, it can be easier to manage stress. Finally, setting boundaries is important for controlling stress; by limiting or reducing contact with sources of stress, or setting limits for how much stress to allow in one's life, it can be easier to manage.",
