  "output": "An example of a hardware device that integrates AI is a robotic vacuum cleaner. Robotics vacuum cleaners can use AI to map out a room and create an efficient cleaning path, as well as detect objects such as furniture and walls to avoid them. Furthermore, they can use AI to adjust their cleaning strategies based on different levels of dirt and debris.",
