  "output": "Once upon a time there lived a grandmother and her grand-daughter who were inseparable. They were very close, spending every dinnertime together. Every night, they would sit around the kitchen table and tell stories of their times growing up. This was something the grand-daughter looked forward to the most, as she would get to hear all the secrets her grandmother never told her parents, secrets of her childhood and the love stories of her youth. Every night, they would finish their stories with a hug, and a promise to tell more the following day.",
